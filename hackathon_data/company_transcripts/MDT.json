My name is Shelby and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronics Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Ryan Weispfenning","Great, thank you, Shelby. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 which ended on April 27, 2018. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.","During this earnings call, many of the statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. References to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and references to annual results increasing or decreasing our comparison to fiscal year 2017; references to organic revenue growth excluding the impact of material acquisitions, divestitures and currencies, references to pro forma exclude the impact of material divestitures. Unless we say otherwise, quarterly and annual rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for material divestitures as well as the impact of foreign currencies. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. I am pleased to announce that this morning we reported strong fourth quarter financial results. Revenues grew 6.5% organic, coming in 100 basis points above the high-end of our guidance range. This marks the second straight quarter of 6.5% organic top-line growth enabling us to more than overcome a very tough first half of the year. ","Q4 non-GAAP operating profit grew 8% pro forma and 9% adjusted for currency, while non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 14% and 15% respectively. The operating margin expanded 80 basis points, pro forma constant currency and as we enter FY 2019, currency at current rates looks to be a tailwind to both margins and earnings for the first time in years.","For the full fiscal year 2018, revenue of $30 billion grew 4.6% organically with a further 40 basis points from acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 9% pro forma and 10% constant currency. The second half of the year was particularly strong overcoming several first half challenges including an IT disruption, multiple hurricanes, fires in Santa Rosa and supply constraints in diabetes. ","Despite all of this we recovered well and came in at the high-end of both the revenue and the EPS guidance we established at the start of the year. We also continued to drive margin expansion, reduced debt leverage, and returned $4.3 billion to shareholders. ","We made significant progress against each of our growth strategies. In Therapy Innovation, we executed a number of meaningful product launches and advanced a pipeline of increasingly ground-breaking medical technologies. We are creating new markets disrupting existing markets and leading in several of the fastest growing growth markets in medtech. ","In globalization, we continued to lead our industry in expanding access into markets around the world including delivering another year of double-digit growth in emerging markets. In economic value, we continued to develop new partnerships and business models to accelerate adoptions of our innovative therapies. ","Our ability to overcome multiple challenges to deliver at the level that we did in the second half of the year reflects the dedication of our 86,000 employees around the world each of whom make a difference to benefit patients and fulfill the Medtronic mission. ","In FY 2018, together with our physician partners, we served over 71 million patients or more than two patients every second. In the fourth quarter, each of our operating groups delivered strong results with mid-single-digit revenue growth in CVG MITG and RTG and over 20% growth in diabetes. Geographically, it was a strong diversified performance with 5.3% growth in the U.S. and 4.6% growth in non-U.S. developed markets including 4.4% growth in Western Europe and 5.5% growth in Japan.","We also had a strong finish to the year with 15.5% growth in emerging markets. At the same time, we expanded our operating margin and delivered 290 basis points of operating leverage. This helped EPS growth of 14% pro forma and 15% constant currency. As we look to FY 2019 and beyond, we have increasing confidence in our ability to deliver operating leverage and margin expansion as a result of our Enterprise Excellence Program which is now fully underway. ","Looking now at our Group results in the quarter, our Cardiac and Vascular Group grew 5.4% delivering sustained growth by leveraging the breadth of its products and services, as well as its strong position in important rapidly expanding markets. ","In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, we had a very good quarter in pacing with high-single-digit growth driven by the continued rollout of our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, as well as the recent launch of the Azure next-generation family of pacemakers. We also continued to see strong growth in Infection Control, AF Solutions and our Mechanical Circulatory Support business.","Coronary & Structural Heart delivered impressive 12.8% growth, driven by the rollout of our Resolute Onyx, drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and Japan as well as, low 20s growth in the transcatheter aortic valves. This was driven by continued strong global demand for our Evolut PRO valve and expanded indications in the U.S., which has resulted in above market levels of growth for the past five quarters.","In addition, during this past quarter, we received approval for our Global pivotal trial of Symplicity Spyral, a new therapy for treatment-resistant hypertension. With this innovative adaptive Bayesian trial design, which leverages prior enrollments in our previously reported off-med clinical study cohorts, patient enrollment is now well underway. ","Positive results of our Symplicity Spyral ON-MED clinical trial were presented yesterday at the EuroPCR Meeting in Paris validating the role this therapy can have in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension as an adjunct to medical therapy.","Our minimally invasive therapies grew 4.8% led by 5.9% growth in Surgical Innovations with strength in Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy and we capitalize on the conversion of surgical procedures from open to minimally invasive. Our innovative products improving outcomes and driving growth including our Signia powered surgical stapling system, which uses our Tri-Staple 2.0 reloads, as well as our ValleyLab FT10 Energy platform and new iterations of our LigaSure vessel sealing instruments. ","Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 6.1% this quarter, its best quarter of organic growth since we established the Group eight years ago. This is despite the well-known challenges in the Spine market and reflects strong execution and robust growth, in particular, in our Brain & Pain divisions. ","In Brain therapies, we are leading the development of the endovascular therapy market for the treatment of ischemic strokes resulting in high-teens growth in neurovascular. We also had a great quarter in neurosurgery with low-double-digit growth reflecting strong demand for our StealthStation S8 Navigation systems, the Mazor X robotic guidance systems for our spine surgeries and our Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation system.","In Pain Therapies, the turnaround is officially underway with back-to-back quarters of strong growth. Our spinal cord stimulation business grew mid-teens this quarter including high-teens in the U.S. We are seeing great acceptance of our new offerings in Spinal Cord Stim including our Intellis stimulator, our Evolve workflow algorithm and our Snapshot reporting. ","This is a dramatic turnaround for a business that declined in the mid-single-digits in FY 2017 and low-double-digits in the first half of this year. ","In Spine, we grew 1% better than the global market, which we estimate is slightly declining. We are seeing emerging strength in our differentiated spine products and procedures including high-single-digit growth in BMP and [OLUS] [ph], strong double-digit growth in Prestige LP Cervical Discs and strong customer adoption of our new SOLERA VOYAGER 5.5\/6.0 fixation systems and ARTiC-L 3D printed titanium cage. ","In addition, when coupling our Spine revenue with the Spine enabling technologies that are reported, in our Neurosurgery business, our combined revenues grew 2.7%. We believe this is a more relevant comparison of our Spine results against our competition and an indication that our Surgical Synergy strategy is working and driving our overall growth in Spine Procedures. ","Diabetes had a very strong finish to the year with low-20s growth driven by U.S. patient demand for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. We now have over 70,000 trained active users in our 670G system. And we continue to get positive feedback with real-world results in line with our physical study data. ","Importantly, we have completed upgrades to our sensor manufacturing lines and now have capacity to meet expected global demand going forward. ","Outside the U.S. we continued to see strong demand for our 640G system. We experienced another quarter of strong performance in Europe and recently received regulatory approval for the 640G in Japan. All of this led to our IIM division growing in the mid-20s internationally. ","Based on the strength of the 6 series systems, IIM\u2019s share grew sequentially to 70% of all durable and consumable parts globally. In addition our sensor attachment rates continued to increase as we shift our customer base from standalone pumps to sensor augmented systems. As this happened, our business is seeing an increasing revenue mix from CGM sensors which creates a strong consistent annuity stream for our diabetes group.","We are also excited about our entry into the $1 billion standalone CGM market with our Guardian Connect systems. As our sensor capacity increased, we ramped up our commercial efforts for this product in Europe this quarter and expect to continue commercial expansion into the new fiscal year. ","In the U.S. we recently received FDA approval for Guardian Connect and intend to start our broad launch in the first quarter. Guardian Connect is the only standalone sensor that transmits directly to its platform. It features unique predictive alerts and in the U.S. when utilized Sugar.IQ which is based in the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for people with diabetes. ","Turning now to our globalization growth strategy, emerging markets which represent 15% of our revenues grew 15.5%. It is important to point out that it is not just one market driving growth, but several and reflects our broad diversification. ","Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe and China all grew double-digits in the fourth quarter. China, our largest emerging market grew 12.7% in the fourth quarter and finished the year with over $1.8 billion in revenues. This is a significant increase from the less than $0.5 billion of revenue in the region when I joined Medtronic seven years ago. ","Our differentiated strategies of public and private partnerships, optimizing the distribution channel and driving local manufacturing and R&D are making a difference, not only in China, but in our emerging markets around the world. We are investing to build strong leading businesses in emerging markets as we continue to collectively represent the single largest opportunity in Medtech. ","Our remaining growth strategy, economic value is an accelerator for therapy innovation and globalization strategies. We continue to make progress in creating new value-based business models that directly link our therapies to proving outcomes. With our direct related value-based healthcare arrangement, we now have over 1100 hospitals under contracts, covering over 30% of our U.S. CRHF implantables revenue helping to drive sequential market share gains in ICDs, CRTs. ","This is one of the reasons why our performance in CRHF has been better than the street was expecting six to nine months back. The other region is innovation where we lead the developments of several important and often disruptive technologies such as Micra. ","Finally, I want you to know that across Medtronic, execution is our top priority. You\u2019ve seen that in our results in the past two quarters. In our resurgence following a string of challenges in the first half of the year, and in our ongoing commitment to cost management that began by achieving our Covidien cost synergies and is now being extended into our enterprise excellence initiatives. ","We know there is much more to be done, but we are excited and optimistic as our direction is clear, our pipeline is full, and our team has never been stronger. ","With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a discussion of our fourth quarter financials. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar. As mentioned, our fourth quarter revenue of $8.144 billion represented a 2.9% increase as reported and organic growth of 6.5%. Foreign currency had a positive $315 million impact on fourth quarter revenue. GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.07. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.42. ","After adjusting for the divestiture, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 14% pro forma and 15% constant currency. The operating margin for the quarter was 30.2%, representing an 80 basis point improvement on a pro forma constant currency basis. Gross margin was down 50 basis points reflecting our sales mix in the quarter. ","The impact of mix on our gross margin this quarter was more than offset by a 150 basis point improvement in SG&A on a pro forma constant currency basis, reflecting our company-wide initiatives on expense leverage. ","Net other expense, which is included in our operating margin was $188 million. This was slightly higher than expected primarily due to mark-to-market on some of our investments. ","Foreign exchange in total had a 160 basis point negative impact on our operating margin in the quarter, primarily due to the year-over-year change in currency gains and losses related to our hedging program. But the good news is that based on current rates, we expect the currency headwind that flagged us for several quarters on the operating margin to turn into a tailwind in fiscal 2019 starting in the first quarter. ","Our fourth quarter non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 14.9%, slightly better than expected given favorable IRS audit resolution. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a non-GAAP diluted basis were 1.366 billion shares. As expected, this was roughly flat sequentially. ","Combining our $1.8 billion of net share repurchase in fiscal 2018, with the $2.5 billion we paid in dividends over the same period, our total payout ratio was 65% on non-GAAP net income and 118% on free cash flow. Free cash flow for fiscal 2018 was $4.7 billion, above our prior guidance range and after adjusting for a $1.1 billion prepayment to the IRS related to our Puerto Rico tax litigation. ","While the litigation is still in process, given our access to cash post tax reform, we elected to put as much of this potential $1.5 billion liability as possible behind us. By prepaying, we were also able to stop the accrual of significant interest. ","In the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $3 billion allowing us now to focus on other capital allocation priorities going forward. Given U.S. Tax Reform, we will be continuing the liquidation of some of our investments overseas, note that this will negatively impact interest income, but it will enable increasing access over the next several quarters to our formerly draft cash on our balance sheet. We intend to put this cash to work by investing in our business and returning to our shareholders. ","Now looking at the picture ahead. For fiscal year 2019, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 4.5%. By business group, we expect CVG. MITG and RTG to grow 4% plus or minus. With CVG likely on the minus side, given the anniversary of major product launches in Coronary and Structural Heart, and MITG and RTG to be more in line with the 4%. We expect Diabetes to grow in the low double-digits, with a stronger first half off of low comparisons. ","For the first quarter, we expect total company revenue to be consistent with our guidance for the year. In addition to CVG, we expect MITG to be on the minus side of the full year, given more difficult comparisons from Endo Stapling and Catheter sales, offset by more robust growth from Diabetes with continued 670G strength.","Turning to margins, we expect operating margin expansion in fiscal year 2019 of approximately 50 basis points on a pro forma constant currency basis driven by our Enterprise Excellence initiatives. For modeling purposes, we would assume a slight improvement in the first quarter with increasing improvement through the remainder of the fiscal year. ","We expect our tax rate to be between 14% and 15%, roughly in line with our fiscal 2018 tax rate. With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.10 to $5.15. This implies EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint of the range. ","For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.10 to $1.12 off the fiscal 2018 base of $1.03. We recognized that the street didn\u2019t have the full picture on first quarter comparisons pro forma for the divestitures until we shared the last week in an 8-K. So hopefully that filing helped. ","Also keep in mind, we had a lower tax rate in the first quarter last year from benefits not expected to repeat creating a roughly $0.03 headwind in the first quarter. ","Finally, on free cash flows, we expect $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2019. This excludes a potential final $400 million payment to Puerto Rico related to our pending litigations that I referenced earlier, the timing and outcome of which is uncertain. ","Over the next couple of years, we expect to make significant progress in improving our free cash flow conversion as litigation and tax payments are expected to diminish and we benefit from programs we have put in place to improve working capital. ","While the impact from currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, our full year revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $50 million to $150 million. Recall the time of our third quarter earnings call, it was a $500 million positive impact. However, despite this $600 million swing, FX is still not as positive for fiscal 2019 margins, earnings and free cash flow because of our hedging program. ","If recent rates hold, we would expect a reported operating margin of 28.5% for the year and a $0.05 tailwind to full year EPS. For the first quarter, if recent rates hold, revenue would be positively affected by approximately $90 million $130 million, operating margin would have a slight benefit, and EPS would have a $0.02 benefit. ","Before I turn the call back to Omar, I would like to note that we plan to hold our biennial Institutional Investor and Analyst Day on Tuesday June 5th in New York City. We intend to discuss our long-term strategies and share our long range plan at that time. ","Now, I will return the call back to Omar. ","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen, and to summarize, we have delivered two consecutive quarters of strong revenue growth to finish our fiscal year. We also expanded our operating margin and delivered meaningful EPS leverage. Looking ahead, we feel good about the growth opportunities in our markets and our competitive position in these markets. ","We expect continued revenue growth and margin expansion and we also focused on generating strong free cash flow conversion and making the right investments to drive shareholder value. And finally, execution is our top priority. ","Before we turn to Q&A, we have the benefit of Mike Weinstein joining us earlier this month. Given his recent transition, we thought it might be helpful for him to make some comments. Mike?","Mike Weinstein ","Certainly. Thanks, Omar. I\u2019ll make a few comments. I think we started - I think with a great quarter. There is a lot of work to do and I\u2019d certainly don\u2019t to want the street to get out ahead of us. But this was a good quarter. Six to nine months ago, when I was on the other side of this call, we on the sell-side were all worried about growth in the companies that always have to queue with the pace of competition, competitors introducing MRIs and tablet pacers, ICDs, deep brain simulators, Insertable Cardiac Monitors et cetera and now here we are six months later that Medtronic has delivered back-to-back quarters in 6.5% organic growth. ","Again, I don\u2019t want everybody to extrapolate on that historic modeling 6.5% going forward, but I do think I speak to the breadth of the franchise and the number of growth drivers moving in the right direction, which honestly the street, myself included underestimated or missed six months back. RTG as you\u2019ve noted Omar had its best quarter in years, growing 6% organic despite all the challenges we are aware in Spine market. Neurovascular grew high-teens, Neurosurgery grew low double-digits and the STS Pain Stim business has had a remarkable turnaround growing mid-teens this quarter after a meaningful decline in the first half of this year. So, that\u2019s all heading in the right direction.","Diabetes, obviously had a fantastic quarter growing 20% plus, well north of what the street was modeling and Guardian standalone hasn\u2019t launched yet in the U.S. and that\u2019s going to start this quarter. So I should go on and back off four operating groups, CVG, RTG, MITG and Diabetes the better than the street was modeling. But the good news is that it\u2019s not just the top-line, margins are starting, and I emphasized starting to go in the right direction. ","Gross margins beat by 20 basis points, SG&A beat by 80 basis points, the FX headwinds margins which was severe this quarter at 150 basis points which we are all focused on three months ago, should go away as we head into FY 2019, obviously assuming at current rates. But there is a long way to go. And I think the good news is that we all know that as Omar said, execution is the number one priority right now and we are not going to let one or two good quarters go to our heads. ","But I feel good that we are clearly heading in the right direction and Investor Meeting on the 5th will give us a chance to talk about us more. ","Omar Ishrak","Good. Thank you, Mike. And let\u2019s open the phone lines now for Q&A. In addition to Karen and Mike, I have asked Mike Coyle who is President of CVG, Bob White, President of MITG, Geoff Martha, President of RTG and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. ","We want try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call.","And with that, operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. ","Robert Hopkins","Thanks very much and congratulations on a great finish to the fiscal year. ","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Hopkins","Yes, it\u2019s a very clear strength and great to see. So I have a quick question for Karen and then a follow-up for Omar. Karen, to start with on operating margins, it\u2019s obviously been a focus point for investors. You delivered 80 basis points of underlying margin in Q4 and 20 basis points for the full fiscal year and you are guiding to 50 for 2019. So I was wondering if you could just talk about the 80 basis points of underlying improvement in Q4, which was a little shy of what you were hoping for at the 100 basis points you talked about. And then more importantly, for fiscal 2019, can you talk about your goal of delivering 50 basis points of underlying margin improvement, which is above the 20 basis points you did this year. So, what are the drivers of that? How much of that is from the restructuring? Just, what gives you confidence, if you can do 50 next year when you did 20 this year? Thank you. ","Karen Parkhill","Yes, thank you for the question, Bob. We were pleased with the operating margin improvement in the fourth quarter of 80 basis points. Keep in mind that that was driven through Covidien synergies that we are now benefiting from, as well as the company-wide focus on expense leverage and it was delivered mostly through improvement note at a 150 basis point improvement in our SG&A. But going forward, we do expect to continue to drive operating margin improvement, we have a company-wide program around Enterprise Excellence, which is intended specifically to drive margin improvement and also to help us offset pricing headwinds and continue to reinvest in our company. That Enterprise Excellence program is well structured, well underway and we are confident in our ability going forward to continue to drive this margin expansion. We\u2019ll talk more about it at Investor Day as well. ","Robert Hopkins","Okay. And then, I did want to follow-up with Omar on the emerging market growth, because it just, it really seems like a standout in the quarter. It drove over two points of growth in the quarter. So, maybe talk about the sustainability of that emerging market growth. Were there any one-time things impacting emerging market growth in this quarter? And kind of what do you assume for fiscal 2019 in terms of emerging market growth? Thank you. ","Omar Ishrak","Well, thanks a lot. Like I mentioned earlier, the story in our emerging markets is our diversification and our presence in multiple geographies. While China is still the largest, we have significant presence in the Middle East and Africa and Latin America. And in the fourth quarter, all of these geographies grew in the mid \u2013 sort of in the mid-teens. And so, that helped a lot in the fourth quarter performance. Going forward, we certainly expect double-digit growth in the emerging markets. I\u2019d say in the low double-digits, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been performing consistently over time. There was certainly no one-time swing here in the fourth quarter. I think the diversification is playing out well for us with at least three big sort of geographic collection of countries that are well diversified amongst themselves. So that\u2019s what gives us a confidence that we can continue to do this and above all the biggest confidence that we have is that we\u2019ve been delivering this for the past five years. So there is nothing other than better performance to expect going forward as our strategy start to play out. ","Robert Hopkins","Terrific. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis ","Good morning. Couple questions for Karen. Karen, just talking about, I want to start off with the growth. So, you mentioned that first quarter growth guidance, you are sort of assuming is comparable for your growth guidance for the remainder of the year. But, the first quarter is also the easiest comp of the year and if you go back to fiscal 2018, the defining element of that year was the first half was dramatically weaker than the second half. So, I guess, said more simply, what drives the momentum in improvement in the business across the remaining three quarters, if the first quarter is going to be comparable with the remainder of the year? ","Karen Parkhill","So, I would remind everyone that our first quarter comes off the heel typically of a very strong end to our fiscal year and the first quarter is typically not our most robust growth quarter. The second quarter will be the quarter next year that comes off very low comparisons, much more so than the first quarter. So we are confident in the guidance that we\u2019ve given for the first quarter consistent with our annual guidance of 4% to 4.5%. But I would remind folks that both for CVG and MITG in the first quarter, we do expect both businesses to be on the minus side of that 4% with MITG having difficult year-over-year comparison from endo stapling and [capital] [ph] sales and CVG seeing the anniversary of some major product launches last year. ","David Lewis ","Okay, very helpful. Karen. The second question is just on cash flow. I know improving cash flow is a big focus for 2019 and beyond, I imagine it will be a focus for the Analyst Day in a couple weeks. But can you just talk about for fiscal 2019, the operating cash flow assumptions, CapEx assumptions, free cash flow conversion, and maybe a little bit about some of the executive compensation changes that maybe happening around free cash? Thanks so much. ","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for the question, David. On free cash flow for FY 2019, we said that we expect it to be between 4.7 and 5.1. We have improved our conversion ratio and honestly we expect to improve that conversion ratio going forward specifically over the next couple of years. In terms of things that impact cash on cash from operations, we expect that to grow in line with earnings, on CapEx, we expect CapEx to be roughly flat year-over-year. We intend to spend a little over $1 billion in CapEx like we did this year. And we will have certain other payments related to our restructuring program, some continued legal payments. But we do expect tax specifically when you include the $1.1 billion payment related to the Puerto Rico litigation to decline meaningfully. We will still have that potential $400 million payment to Puerto Rico, it\u2019s unclear whether or not that payment will need to be made in fiscal 2019. It will be dependent on the outcome of the litigation. But, we will have that as well. ","David Lewis ","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar ","Hey guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here. So maybe, Karen, you are just talking about the guidance and the cash conversion rate. So, for the EPS guidance what kind of assumptions are we making on capital deployment? When you talk about cash conversions improving, what should be a normalized cash conversion for this business? Can Medtronic go to in a 90% or north of 90% over the medium-term? ","Karen Parkhill","So, on EPS, we are assuming this is organic. We obviously don\u2019t assume that we make any acquisitions or divestitures. On tax, I did say that we expect 14% to 15% tax rate for the year and on our debt, we expect that to remain relatively stable now that we have completed the debt paydown that we have talked about. In terms of return to shareholders, we did announce recently that we expect to repurchase $1.2 billion in shares throughout the year. That was commensurate with us talking about some debt tendering that we were doing. In terms of a normal cash conversion, keep in mind that our Medtech industry is typically around the 80% conversion rate and we expect to be improving to that range over the next couple of years. We are very focused on it and we expect particularly some of the one-time charges that we\u2019ve had over the past will be diminishing. ","Vijay Kumar ","That\u2019s extremely helpful. And maybe one for Omar. Medtronic has done a fantastic job on the top-line, right. I think the issue has always been for us, maybe modeling some of the FX impacts in the moving parts, at the prior Analyst Days, Omar, a lot of the focus was on innovation in top-line, what\u2019s happening with Medtronic, right. And when we think about the upcoming Analyst Day, is there anything going to be different at this Analyst Day in terms of focus? Should we be expecting any update on the Robot or anything else that you want to highlight? Thank you. ","Omar Ishrak","Well, I can assure you that technology and innovation will still be at the top of the agenda. That\u2019s what we are most excited about. That\u2019s what fuels this company. And we have got many \u2013 our pipeline is fuller than it\u2019s ever been and we are extremely excited about it and we\u2019ll be \u2013 and really looking forward to sharing all of that with you at Investor Day. But equally, we are laying out an enterprise excellence program and our focus in operating margins, our focus on cash flow are elements that are serious and I expect that will come through at Analyst Day. So, again, there is going to be no drop-offs in our excitement here on technology and if anything is increased, and you will see exciting examples from all our groups. But I do want to emphasize that the operating margin focus and our cash flow conversion focus is driven by our enterprise excellence program will be clear as well. ","Vijay Kumar ","Sorry, on the robots, should we be expecting any update on the robot? ","Omar Ishrak","Well, look, we will, Robot is a major program for us. And obviously, we are going to talk about it.","Vijay Kumar ","Thank you guys. ","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please? ","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. ","Lawrence Biegelsen ","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on TAVR and one on just the new product launches in fiscal 2019. So, maybe for Mike Coyle, by our math it looks like, the worldwide TAVR market did slow a bit in calendar Q1. Is that accurate? And what are you seeing in the market? At PCR today, one of the presenters said that you would be presenting your low risk data at ACC in 2019. I just want to confirm that\u2019s accurate, that would be pretty impactful. And just lastly on TAVR, Mike, any expectations for the MEDCAC, do you think it\u2019s more likely to expand, keep the same or decrease tenors? ","Michael Coyle","So, thanks for the question, Larry. In terms of the TAVR growth profile for the quarter, we would peg TAVR growth at somewhere in the vicinity of the high-teens, which obviously is a slowdown from two years ago in mid-20s. But for the fiscal year, it was low-20s, but still that\u2019s very strong growth given the size that that market that\u2019s grown to and for us, obviously, we\u2019ve been growing faster than that in the low-20s. So, it\u2019s been an important growth driver for and we expect it to continue to be an important growth driver for us. In terms of pipeline, we are going to cover that at the Analyst Meeting. Next Tuesday, we will show you what we have in terms of beyond EnVeo with the system that is now going on the United States and into Europe, we will talk about that pipeline in terms of both iterations and then some of the more significant platform investments that we are making in TAVR going forward and as mentioned what we are doing in mitral. And then, in terms of the MEDCAC, our position is a bit intermediate to what we hear coming from the society as I meant from some competitors in the sense that, we believe that all current news \u2013 the current mass coverage \u2013 decision to coverage all of the indications we use for TAVR that are approved and we don\u2019t see constraints at the moment in terms of being able to meet demand. We do think it\u2019s the \u2013 what the societies are proposing as adopted that we can see upwards of 35% of the centers now falling out of the ability to provide TAVR and we think it would a problem for the access for this life-saving technology. And so, our view would be to maintain the national coverage decision until there is an expanded FDA approval for indications that are not covered by the MTD. And that would then give us time to basically evaluate the question of our centers that are smaller and a lower volume actually performing worst than those at high volume. And frankly the data that we have seen today would not support a conclusion that we are seeing meaningfully worst results in those smaller centers. So we think, the MCD as it exists today is good. We will support its continuation and we think it might be the right time to look at that maybe in a couple of years. ","Lawrence Biegelsen ","Thanks, Mike. And Omar, I know you have your Analyst Day, obviously in a week or two. But just for \u2013 just to give us confidence in your guidance for fiscal 2019, what are the product launches that you are most excited about for fiscal 2019? Thanks for taking the questions, guys. ","Omar Ishrak","Thanks. I\u2019ll just name a few and as you mentioned, we will go through our overall pipeline in greater depth. The Pain business, this turnaround in Pain is very significant and we are extremely excited about what we are seeing and we are seeing that with the Intellis product, our Evolve workflow in our snapshot reporting. I think it\u2019s a unique element in that industry and it\u2019s a massive turnaround as recently as in the first half of this year and something we are getting a lot of traction. So I think, continued momentum in Pain is something that we will definitely see. Diabetes is the other one. I mean, we are just starting there to get the full benefit of the 670G in the U.S. and we are extremely excited about what we see. But equally, we\u2019ve got penetration of the 670G into global markets. On the back of the 640G which is already very successful. And then the Guardian Connect is a whole big opportunity which I mentioned was also is a big area for us. I think in CVG, you heard Mike talk about it. But there is many areas here. One that, I don\u2019t know the exact contribution to growth, but I am extremely excited about its further evolution of the Micra product, which is a revolutionary product for us and one that we are extremely proud about. And the consistent growth that we\u2019ve seen in surgical technologies within MITG will continue. We have a rich pipeline of products and they come out regularly and that will be sustained into next years. So, we expect an exciting year, full of new products, which will continue to fuel our growth. ","Lawrence Biegelsen ","Thanks for taking the questions, guys. ","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Larry. Next question, Shelby?","Operator","Your next question comes from Robbie Marcus of JPMorgan. ","Robbie Marcus","Hi and congrats on the good quarter.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks.","Robbie Marcus","Two of the businesses that stood out were Diabetes and Spinal Cord Stim and Omar, you touched on this just briefly in the last question. But, do you have new product launches there maybe you could give a little more color into what you are seeing in the dynamics with the product launches? And how you think that's impacting the market?","Omar Ishrak","Sure. I\u2019ll let the two group leaders kind of briefly comment on that. So, Hooman, do you want to go with Diabetes first? ","Hooman Hakami","Sure. Robbie, I think that the quarter was really strong. We had some great balanced performance across businesses, across geographies. I\u2019d say, there were really two main drivers. The first is strong global pump growth that we saw and Omar just touched on this a second ago. The first was just continued strong uptake of the 640G in markets outside the United States, but in particular, Europe. And then, we have seen continued strong performance out of the 670G in the U.S. and this is really encouraging, because in many ways, we are just getting started here. So, you look at those dynamics, all of those things led to six points of share gains for us across both consumable and durable pumps this past quarter which we are obviously really excited about. The second big driver for us was the pull-through of sensors. This is as we sell more integrated systems, we are seeing more sensor pull-through. So both the 640G, the 670G are driven by sophisticated algorithms where the pump and the sensor work together to keep a patient in control. As we sell more of these systems, the more sensors we pull-through. So those two dynamics were really the catalysts for us this quarter and then, looking forward, we expect both of these things to continue and for us starting to capitalize on a standalone CGM market that we are just starting to get into.","Omar Ishrak","And Geoff, say few words about Pain. ","Geoffrey Martha","Yes, sure. Sure, Robbie. Obviously, Intellis is off to a strong start for a couple of reasons. One, the device itself, I mean, it\u2019s much, much smaller than the competition. It\u2019s a much faster, three or four times faster recharged, very little battery saved over time, MR compatible, et cetera. And so, just a real compelling differences there. And in addition, our Evolve Workflow which really drives the outcome has been, I believe underappreciated. And these two things taken together get us back in the game. Regarding Evolve, we are still building credibility as we produce more robust data over time. We just launched our Vector trial which is our prospective clinical trial testing multiple aspects of Evolve. We are thinking enrollments underway and on schedule and we anticipate the first release of this data at NANS in January of 2019. In addition, we published some other data from, we call the Verdolin data from Dr. Verdolin. We\u2019ve presented that recently at two scientific meetings and we got really strong results. So this is an independent physician study nearing real world outcomes and we had 83% of the 114 patients, 114 patients had 75% pain reduction. So this is really good result. So after three months, we saw similar results. So, we are seeing really strong data from Evolve and that\u2019s going to continue to build over the course of the year and I think help us access a whole new group of physicians and patients. So, we are \u2013 as Omar indicated, we are really excited about the Pain Stim business and the strong market growth and how we are positioned within it. ","Robbie Marcus","Thanks and a quick follow-up for Karen. With FX moving so much, maybe you could help us think about how it might impact the gross margin and the other income line? And with higher interest expense run rate, what that might be for next year? Thanks. ","Karen Parkhill","So, in terms of FX, with the recent movement over the last month in currency rates, we do now expect a bit of a headwind for the full year from FX on revenue and I mentioned between $50 million to $150 million. But I also mentioned the good news is that we still expect a positive impact from FX on our operating margin, on our EPS and on our free cash flow and the key reason for that is our hedging program. Based on where rates are today, we do expect gains in our hedging program that shows up in our net other expense line item and positively impacts our operating margin. You had a second question, Robbie. Will you remind me that one?","Robbie Marcus","Just the - how will FX impacts down the P&L and what interest expense might look like given the higher run rate?","Karen Parkhill","Right. So on interest expense, obviously, interest expense \u2013 the interest rates have been increasing. So we will have a modest impact from that on an interest expense perspective. On an interest income perspective, I did mentioned that, we are focused on continuing to liquidate our overseas portfolio and as we do that we will have interest income coming down a little bit. ","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Robbie. Take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro ","Good morning guys. Thank you. A question on the 2019 op margin expansion guidance that you gave for that 50 basis points, if I think about your prior plan for that $3 billion in gross cost savings through 2022, could you help us understand kind of what\u2019s embedded in the 2019 guidance for margin expansion as it relates to that program to be helpful to understand the pacing there and the net effects?","Karen Parkhill","Sure, so, when we gave our enterprise excellence, when we announced our enterprise excellence program and talked about the over $3 billion in savings and leverage that that would deliver through 2022, we also said that we expected over $500 million to $700 million impact or positive savings in leverage annually each year. That is now embedded into our forecast. So that program is designed to offset pricing pressure which we expect continued pricing pressure. It is also intended to help ensure that we can continue to reinvest, particularly in R&D and it is intended to drive operating margin improvement and expansion. And for next year, I mentioned, we expect operating margin expansion of about 50 basis points pro forma constant currency. ","Isaac Ro ","Okay, got it. And then, maybe just a follow-up question on couple product specifically on SCS. Omar, you called out the mid-teens growth there. I think a little bit better in the U.S. and just trying to understand as we think about the sequential trends from here as Intellis ramps, and do you expect that growth rate to accelerate on a year-on-year basis? Trying to figure out kind of what\u2019s embedded there? Thank you. ","Omar Ishrak","And Geoff, Do you want to take that?","Geoffrey Martha","Yes, sure. Look, it\u2019s clearly off to a strong start. I\u2019ve cautioned you to not extrapolate continued further growth in terms of market share until some of this data comes out. The data that I mentioned a few minutes ago is going to take some time and that will \u2013 I think drive incremental growth, but we do think it will maintain. This is a sustainable growth driver, but in terms of acceleration, we really, I think need to provide more data in order to accelerate that growth rate. But it is not kind of a one-time blip. We do think this is going to sustain. ","Isaac Ro ","Okay, thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Isaac. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy of Jefferies. ","Anthony Petrone","Thank you, Anthony for Raj. Maybe two product questions and then an operating margin question. Just to clarify on 670G share gains, is that from prior on the MDI patients who are existing pumps\/CGM users? So that\u2019s the first product question. The second would be on SPYRAL. You had data out at EuroPCR. Maybe just to recap on why this program is different from the prior Symplicity program and what the update on market opportunity is there? And then on operating margins, can you clarify that mark-to-market gains and losses on securities? How that could impact operating margin next year? And if the company is contemplating shifting that out of other income? Thanks. ","Omar Ishrak","Hooman, do you want to go?","Hooman Hakami","Yes, with respect to the 670G, we are getting penetration of the 670G really across, I would say, patient populations certainly our own installed base competitive conversion and MDIs. So we are seeing all three. I think as you look forward though, we do expect more penetration within MDI, because as the data comes in and now we have, as you heard from the commentary, 70,000 trained patients where the results are in line with the pivotal. As more of this data comes through and as physicians see this data, I anticipate, we will see even a greater penetration within MDI.","Omar Ishrak","Mike, do you want to take Spyral?","Michael Coyle","As it relates to Spyral, there are a whole bunch of things different about the data that were presented here both the Off-Med that we\u2019ve shown back at the ESC last fall, as well as the data shown yesterday at the PCR Meeting. For one thing, the device is different the HTN3 data we are studying the Flex device. This is Spyral which basically is targeting in different part of the anatomy going more digital in the renal artery, which is where we are seeing congregation of the nerves that we are trying to denigrate. So, that has been an important contributor to the reliability of the denigration. Number two, the patient population is different. In the original study, we had mostly loaned systolic patients, older patients involved to a very extensive, if you will hardening of the arteries which were less responsive to the treatment. And so, that by moving to a patient population that is actually a bit left sick, but has both systolic and diastolic tension. We\u2019ve seen a much higher response rate which was shown in the HTN3 data and obviously has now elevated here. In addition, we are using ambulatory blood pressure measurement as the basis for the analysis which gets away from a lot of the whitecoat and hypertension issues that were shown. But probably the biggest difference here is that, what\u2019s become clear is that patients are non-compliant to their medications and we showed the data that basically 40% to 50% of patients who say they are taking medication are not taking the medication. We were able to validate that by looking at not only your analysis but also blood levels. And it\u2019s very clear that that was a huge confounder to the original HTN3 data and then it created case variability in the statistics. And so, by carefully factoring that out in our analysis, we were able to now show, not only with the Off-Med study that we\u2019ve shown, but now with the On-Med study that we\u2019ve shown yesterday that we have not only statistically significant, but clinically significant reductions in the blood pressure levels. And so, we are now rolling into the pivotal study using the adaptive Bayesian design, which means we are already 35% through the enrollment phase of the study for the pivotal trial. So, it\u2019s a very exciting program for us and something that we spent a lot of years fixing and now we are moving ahead with the pivotal trial. ","Omar Ishrak","Karen, do you want to take that? ","Karen Parkhill","And on operating margin, yes, I did mention we had some mark-to-market losses in the quarter. They were primarily related to the warrants that we own on Muzor and yes, we are planning to shift mark-to-market gains and losses going forward into non-GAAP reporting. ","Anthony Petrone","Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Anthony. Next question, Shelby.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell of SunTrust.","Bruce Nudell ","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Omar, a question for you and then, a couple questions on products. So, firstly, just looking at the midpoint of top-line guidance next year, it\u2019s feeling like, you are thinking developed markets for Medtronic grow 2.5% to 3% and emerging markets more 12% to 15%. Is that the right way to be thinking about it? And is that really the slowdown in developed markets really just due to the product introduction timings? ","Omar Ishrak","Emerging markets are in the double-digits and I think that\u2019s the way you should model it. I think we\u2019ve got confidence in that and then the remainder is the developed markets. So, I think if you build the model out from that, that\u2019s the basis you do it. So, we are pretty confident on the double-digit emerging market as a baseline and then the swing will be in developed markets which is usually driven by innovation cycles. ","Bruce Nudell ","Okay, thanks so much. And then, Geoff, just on the spinal cord stimulation, what\u2019s the internal confidence that the low kilohertz, sub-perception is really close to 10 kilohertz and that waveform optionality is also very important to having durable long-term pain relief? ","Geoffrey Martha","Well, that\u2019s been our position in our data is proving that out that we believe that patients benefit over time from the optionality between high dose and low dose energy. And we are going to continue to do more and that\u2019s really the heart of Evolve Workflow. Right, so, one, make it simple, one having the flexibility to between high dose and low dose, we think over time, produces the best outcomes. However, you need to provide physicians with a recipe for doing that. So they can get consistent outcome and mitigate complex patient follow-up and that\u2019s our Evolve Workflow and we are very confident in that. Not just internally, but you are seeing external confidence building, I mentioned the Verdolin data that we just talked about in the couple of scientific conferences recently and that our Vectors trial, that we will be \u2013 announcing the data on that in NANS 2019. ","Bruce Nudell ","And my final question is, SAPIEN 3 showed very good results extracted from the TVT registry in bicuspid patients. I am pretty sure you guys have done the same sort of analysis and could you just say how core of that was looking in that registry amongst bicuspid patients that of course important once the low risk label is garnered?","Geoffrey Martha","Yes, Bruce, we are prepared to show the data, but we are absolutely doing that analysis as the basis for an approval for bicuspid. And obviously, the rich dataset of TVT is going to provide us the basis for being able to see what the effect is. But we are very optimistic about that analysis being supportive of seeing similar outcomes to what we see in the intermediate risk and higher risk groups.","Bruce Nudell ","Thanks so much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Bruce. Shelby, we\u2019ll take one more question, please.","Operator","Your final question comes from Steven Lichtman of Oppenheimer. ","Steven Lichtman ","Thank you. Hi guys. Just first question on core spine. As you mentioned during prepared remarks, the recent soft patch here is well-known. Just wondering what your latest views on the market are? Maybe most recent dots on the drivers of the growth challenged and do you think we could see a pickup and if so, what would be the driver there?","Omar Ishrak","Well, first of all, look for Medtronic Spine, I am pleased with our performance against the softer market that you mentioned. We grew our Spine business as reported 1%. And then when you combine that with our enabling technologies, which like \u2013 things like, Spine Navigation, and Robotics, we grew closer to 3%. So, we believe this is definitely outpacing the competition. Now, regarding softer market, I mean, look, what we are seeing is that, historically, the procedure growth has outpaced the pricing pressure for maybe a net 2% - 3% global market growth. But in the last couple quarters, that procedure growth has softened and it has not outpaced the price declines, the price pressures. So, you are seeing more of a flat to slightly down market. That\u2019s why I am pretty excited about our performance and that\u2019s been driven by the Spine and the Core Spine and biologics piece is in the high-single-digit growth and BMP and our lateral approach called OLIF, strong double-digit growth with our PRESTIGE LP Cervical Discs, and then, we\u2019ve got a number of new product launches that are just starting to take hold, our SOLERA VOYAGER 5.5\/6.0 system, ARTiC-L 3D printed titanium cage, and then, coming up here shortly, we\u2019ve got an INFINITY posterior cervical system coming to market. So that's the whole speed to scale strategy of our Core Spine business. And then on top of that, our Navigation, Robotics, power tools, nerve monitoring, all that together, in its further integrating that, and helping physicians to use these tools to improve both clinical and economic outcomes. We believe that combined with our Spine business is going to be growing 3% plus going forward. And the final thing I would say that\u2019s helping our Spine business maybe versus some others as our global exposure. In China for example, which is a big business for us, our Spine business growing 8%. So our OUS growth is stronger than our U.S. growth and pulling up the business. So, those three things continued speed to scale of our product launches within Core Spine, enabling technology and improving clinical and economic outcomes and really differentiating us and helping our core spine business. And then, finally, the mix of OUS growth, particularly in our emerging markets. Those three things will help us grow faster than the market in terms of predicting the market, it\u2019s that hard to do. We think \u2013 we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get much weaker. We do think maybe a slight uptick, but it\u2019s very hard to predict that. ","Steven Lichtman ","Great. Thanks for that. And then, just last thing, Karen, the clarification on capital allocation in FY 2019, you are clear on the reduced interest income as you position the balance sheet post Tax Reform. But are you assuming any uses of that freed up cash whether through reinvestment in the business or enhanced buyback beyond the $1.2 billion that you\u2019ve previously talked about?","Karen Parkhill","No, at this stage, we \u2013 the liquidation of these assets probably will take some time. So we are not necessarily anticipating any large change in capital allocation other than what we\u2019ve already communicated.","Steven Lichtman ","Okay, thanks guys.","Omar Ishrak","Okay, so with that, thank you all very much for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic.

This morning we reported second quarter financial results including revenue of $7.1 billion, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were a $1.07 growing 2% or 5% after adjusting for the approximate 3%, a $0.03 impact from Hurricane Maria.","These financial results are very encouraging when considered in the context of a quarter in which we faced three hurricanes and the California wildfires. Hurricane Maria in particular significantly affected our manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico. The lives of thousands of our employees were affected by these natural disasters, yet the resiliency, dedication and persistence of our team to overcome these challenges was remarkable.","Against this backdrop, which resulted in not only a quantifiable impact to our quarter but also an unquantifiable impact from the disruption to our teams. We delivered 3% comparable constant currency revenue growth or 4% excluding the direct impact from Hurricane Maria. Our performance continues to be driven by our growth strategies of therapy innovation, globalization and economic value.","In therapy innovation as I noted last quarter, we have entered a period of clear acceleration in our innovation cycle. We see increased revenue momentum from several important new product launches which we expect will continue into the second half of the fiscal year.","In Q2, organic growth in our Cardiac and Vascular Group was 6%, a sequential improvement of approximately 340 basis points and the main driver of our total company organic growth acceleration. Overall, CVG grew 7% year-over-year leveraging the breadth of its products and services, as well as its strong positions in important rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth.","In CRHF, which grew in the mid-single digits, we are maintaining market share in the core pacing ICD and CRT product lines while creating new markets that are meaningfully enhancing our weighted average market growth.","This past quarter combined revenue from our high-growth CRHF product lines representing about a third of our CRHF business grew organically in the mid-20s. Specifically, these product lines included our infection control, diagnostics, transcatheter pacemakers, AF Solutions and Mechanical Circulatory Support systems.","Similarly our CSH business is shifting its revenue mix towards higher growth transcatheter valve market which now represents about a third of total CSH revenues.","In TAVR, we delivered low 40s growth in the U.S. and high 30s growth in international markets as we see both strong adoption around the world for our recently introduced Evolut PRO valve, as well as expansion in traditional U.S. TAVR centers and U.S. share capture resulting from our new intermediate risk indication.","In Coronary, our DES product line returned to growth as we gain low to mid-single digits points of market share sequentially in both the U.S. and Japan driven by the recent launch of our Resolute Onyx in these markets.","Next, our minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 2% less than our initially expected given the impact of Hurricane Maria. In Surgical Innovations our 4% growth was driven by new products in advanced stapling and advanced energy. In advanced stapling, growth was driven by our endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology, as well as Signia, our new single-handed powered surgical stapling system that provide surgeons with real-time feedback during surgery.","In Advanced Energy, we experienced strong growth as we continue to rollout new LigaSure instruments and our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. These innovations are providing momentum to the transition from open surgical procedures to minimally invasive surgery or MIS resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. As we look ahead, we see the opportunity to expand the availability of MIS procedures through the use of our surgical robot platform.","The development team continues to drive toward first-in-human use by the end of this fiscal year. We look forward to offering a more comprehensive value proposition to our customers across all key surgical areas, open surgery, traditional MIS, robotic surgery and services.","Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 2% this quarter less than initial expected given the impact of Hurricane Maria. Our Brain Therapies division had a very strong quarter with 13% growth. This was driven by high 20s growth in neurovascular with strength across the entire stroke portfolio and mid-teens growth in neurosurgery.","Our Spine division declined 1%, a reflection of the hurricane impact, as well as a continued modest deceleration in the global spine market. Excluding the impact of Hurricane Maria, our core spine business performed better than the market. We attribute this is to the ongoing success of our speed to scale product launch initiative, as well as our surgical synergy strategy which combines our enabling technologies such as imaging, navigation, power systems, nerve monitoring and now Mazor Robotics with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedures.","Inside the combination of our enabling technologies which are reported in our neurosurgery business with our spine revenue, resulted in 2% growth in Q2. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine results against several of our competitors.","Our Pain Therapies division recently received FDA approval at CE Mark for our Intellis spinal cords stimulator. While the initial rollout is affected by Hurricane Maria, the product has been received positively by our customer and we do expect Intellis to reverse the declines we have been experiencing with several quarters in the pain stem business.","And finally the FDA lifted its distribution requirements in our implantable drug pump this last month and its warning letter earlier this month. The warning letter had affected not only our pain therapies division but also our brain modulation in public health businesses.","Turning to Diabetes, revenue growth declined 2% better than what we had anticipated due to the strong demand from patients willing to purchase the MiniMed 670G pump ahead of the prepared CGM sensors. Although sensor supply constraints hampered overall growth, our ability to meet increasing patient demand has improved and our sensor capacity expansion plans are on track.","Last month, JNJ announced that they were exiting the insulin pump market and we were pleased that they selected us as their partner of choice to facilitate the transition of the Animas patients. While the majority of the approximately 90,000 existing Animas patients are currently under warranty, we are actively working to ensure their smooth transition to Medtronic if they like to do so.","Looking ahead we expect diabetes revenue growth to increase in the third fiscal quarter now that we've finished shipping pumps for our Priority Access Program and then continue to accelerate when we complete our sensor capacity expansion plans in the fourth fiscal quarter.","In addition, our diabetes innovation pipeline remains robust across all three of its divisions. We're preparing for the international launch of the 670G and the U.S. launch of our standalone CGM system Guardian Connect with sugar IQ both later this fiscal year and our new professional CGM iPro\u00ae3 in FY 2019.","Next let\u2019s turn to our globalization growth strategy. Emerging markets again grew 12% this quarter in line with our long-term double-digit growth expectations as we continue to expand access to our products and services around the world. Latin America grew 18% but Brazil our highest market in the region growing in the mid-20s. We continue to drive our channel optimization strategy in Latin America expanding our direct operations.","In the Middle East and Africa we grew 13% as recovery in the region continues with strong growth in Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Southeast Asia grew 12% with strength in spine, brain therapies and Coronary & Structural Heart divisions.","Greater China also grew 12% with high-teens growth in RTG, mid-teens growth in MITG, and low double-digit growth in CVG. We've been outperforming the China market now for the past few years and believe we can continue this momentum over the coming quarters.","Let\u2019s turn now to our third growth strategy economic value. As mentioned previously, we are seeing strong growth in our TYRX value based program for infection control and implantable devices. Nearly tripling the accounts under contract in the quarter to over 900 hospitals. This past quarter over 20% of our U.S. CRHF's implantable revenue was covered under a TYRX related value-based healthcare arrangement that links total payment to patient infection outcomes.","In the past two quarters, we have rolled out additional value-based programs in CVG linking payment to improve patient outcomes that result directly from our innovative therapies. Specifically, as part of these programs a portion of our payment is tied to reducing reinterventions when using our AF ablation, AAA and DCB therapies and reducing rehospitalizations when using our ICD, CRT and AF ablation technologies.","We are aggressively developing other unique value based solutions across each of our groups and regions. We remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improve patient outcomes over volume.","We're increasingly partnering with additional stakeholders on the healthcare value chain, as we believe medical technology has a key role to play in delivering better outcomes while improving efficiency for healthcare systems. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients and healthcare systems, as well as our shareholders.","With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a discussion of our second quarter financials and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you.","As Omar mentioned, our second quarter revenue of $7,050,000,000 represented a 4% decrease as reported and growth of approximately 3.4% on a comparable constant currency basis or 4.3% when further adjusting for Hurricane Maria.","Foreign currency had a positive $35 million impact on second quarter revenue and tuck-in acquisitions contributed approximately 30 basis points to revenue growth. While all four of our groups had some level of manufacturing in Puerto Rico, the direct financial impact of Hurricane Maria was limited to MITG and RTG.","As Omar mentioned, through the hard work and determination of many colleagues, we utilized alternate manufacturing sites, directed field inventory movement, and ultimately we're able to restore operations more quickly than anticipated.","GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.48, non-GAAP was $1.07. After adjusting for the divestiture, the $0.01 positive impact from foreign currency and $0.03 negative impact from Hurricane Maria, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 5%.","The operating margin for the quarter was 26.6% on a comparable constant currency basis representing a year-over-year decline of 100 basis points. As expected our operating margin declined in the quarter as we supported new product launches and experienced a temporary impact of lighter revenue in our diabetes group.","In addition, the infusion set recall in diabetes and impact of Hurricane Maria further affected our second quarter operating margins. Despite the net decline, we continue to deliver on our Covidien synergies and expect to reach our goal of delivering $850 million of synergies this fiscal year.","As we mentioned in the past, we expect to continue our focus on margin improvement even after delivery of the synergies and intent to provide detail on those ongoing activities in the near future.","Non-GAAP net other expense which is included in our operating margin was $96 million compared to $65 million in the prior year, and negatively affected our operating margin by 20 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis. The change was impacted by increased expense related to our currency hedging program, as well as the prior year gain from our equity investment in hardware.","Looking ahead we expect net other expense to be approximately $75 million per quarter including approximately $20 million to $30 million net per quarter related to our currency hedging program based on recent exchange rates.","Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 15% better than initially expected given a year-to-date impact of our recent divestiture on our annual tax rate. We now expect our tax rate to be between 15% and 16% for the remainder of the year.","Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,366,000,000 shares. We repurchased a net $568 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we continue to expect shares to stay roughly flat.","Combining our share repurchase activity with the $622 million we paid in dividends in the second quarter, our total payout ratio was 82% on non-GAAP net income and 59% on GAAP net income.","Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to reiterate our annual revenue and EPS growth guidance. Unless specified, all of my guidance comments are comparable constant currency.","For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect revenue growth to be in a range of 4% to 5%. This would imply second half growth of approximately 4.5% to 6.5%, a range we would expect for both the third and the fourth quarters.","Looking at full year revenue growth by our business groups, given the strength of its new products, we continue to expect CVG to grow in a range of 5.5% to 7% with growth weighted to the third quarter due to more favorable prior year comparison.","For MITG we now expect growth to be in a range of 3% to 3.5% given the lower growth in the first half due in part to Hurricane Maria. This implies accelerated second half growth of 3.5% to 4.5% which is consistent with our prior guidance range.","We continue to expect RTG to grow approximately 3% balancing the impact of Hurricane Maria and in spine market that is flat to slightly down with continued strength in brain therapies.","Finally in our diabetes group, we expect growth to significantly improve in the second half given the completion of the Priority Access Program, as well as an expected increase in sensor supply by the fourth quarter resulting in mid to high single-digit growth for the full-year.","Regarding margins for the remainder of the year, we expect our gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year and our operating margin to reflect significant improvement in the third and stronger improvement of over 100 basis points in the fourth quarter.","With respect to earnings, we continue to expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. As I have previously noted, we expect EPS growth to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year and would expect third quarter EPS growth to be at the midpoint to upper end of the annual 9% to 10% range.","While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast, its recent exchange rates remains stable for the full fiscal year our full-year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $375 million including an approximate $155 million to $175 million tailwind in the third quarter.","Our third and fourth quarter operating margins would be negatively affected by approximately 50 to 100 basis points with the fourth quarter impact greater than the third. And our full-year EPS would be affected by approximately negative $0.02 including a positive impact of approximately $0.01 in the third quarter.","Keep in mind the effect of FX on revenue, margin and EPS can differ due to the magnitude of the year-over-year change and expense related to our currency hedging program along with the timing difference of FX and cost of goods sold reflecting inventory turns on our balance sheet.","Regarding free cash flow, we continue to expect it to grow in the high single-digits compounded annually from fiscal year '16 to '18 on a comparable basis given the divestiture which removes the tax and transaction costs, as well as the loss of free cash flow generated by the divested businesses.","Lastly while we intend to give our fiscal year '19 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in May, I know that many of you are starting to think about your forward models. At this point, I would encourage you to keep in mind our longer-term mid-single digit revenue growth outlook, as well as our long-range plans to continue to drive operating margin expansion.","While CVG is expected to ease back into mid single-digit growth next fiscal year given prior year comparisons, we are expecting MITG and RTG to grow in the mid-single-digits and diabetes to deliver double-digit growth.","We intend to give our fiscal year 2019 growth guidance on a comparable basis that excludes the impact of the divestiture from the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and has the effect of lowering the base revenue by approximately $550 million and EPS by approximately $0.07. It is also worth noting that if current exchange rates remain stable through next year, we would expect a positive impact to revenue up to a $100 million and a slightly positive impact on EPS.","Now I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Karen, and I\u2019d like to conclude by noting that I realized that our shareholders are expecting consistent execution and reliable results from Medtronic. Know that your management team and Board expect the same. Over the past few quarters our performance has been affected by some extraordinary events which have masked the improving overall fundamentals of our business.","That said, we aspire to be a company that can manage through even extraordinary events similar to those that we've recently faced. So we're keenly focused on solid execution, as well as leveraging our diversification and scale around the world to deliver dependable results for our shareholders.","Let's now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have Mike Coyle, President of CVG, Bryan Hanson President of MITG, Geoff Martha, President of RTG, and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us.","We want to try to get to as many questions as possible. So please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call.","So with that operator first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Omar first off, let me - forget the question, let me just say that I know how tough this quarter was in Puerto Rico and Santa Rosa and just congratulations, good work that we did on behalf of all your employees that were impacted by both the hurricanes and the fires so I know it was significant let me get two questions and I\u2019ll do one question and then follow-up.","The first question is on the growth outlook for the second half if I try and adjust for all the different activity, you effectively did 3% organic growth in the first half of the fiscal year adjusted for the hurricanes, you did 4% this quarter adjusted for the hurricanes. You're guiding to 4.5% to 6.5% in the second half of the year and that's organic, there is no acquisition contribution and that\u2019s despite what is a tougher comp in the back half of the year to the overall Medtronic.","So besides diabetes accelerating which I think that we can all see, can you just talk about the rest of the business and what gives you confidence in the overall Medtronic acceleration despite this comps?","Omar Ishrak","I think let\u2019s go through this group by group, I think they\u2019re almost all product driven on a basis of emerging market growth that continues to grow in the double digits and we\u2019re seeing that pretty consistently. And non-U.S. developed market growth in around 5% or so that we've been delivering.","So if you take the U.S. which is really the recipient of most of our new products, CVG has the most exciting portfolio here with the CoreValve Evolut PRO currently launching in the U.S. and Europe to be a risk indication for TAVR. The HVAD destination therapy, as well as the Micra leadless pacemaker I think these are the key drivers for accelerated growth in CVG like we mentioned earlier and we are pretty confident given the momentum that we've seen in the just concluded quarter that this will continue.","Now in the other groups too we\u2019re seeing continued improvement and you\u2019ll see a tick-up in growth in all of them and you mentioned diabetes yourself but in addition in MITG we have many product launches in FY 2018 including our Signia powered stapler and reinforced reloads instruments. And in RTG our enabling technologies are really taking hold, we had good traction with our capital equipment in Q2 and we expect that to continue.","We think specifically the StealthStation S8 which brings an advanced solution to neurosurgeons we'll have this quite a bit in the upcoming quarters. So, as you can see Mike this confidence in our growth is really driven by an acceleration of our innovation pipeline and we feel pretty good about it.","Mike Weinstein","And just my one follow-up, Karen can you spend a minute on free cash flow your free cash flow to the first half of the year was 1.1 billion, if I'm correct your commentary about high single upper single-digit free cash flow growth of FY 2016 to FY 2018 would imply somewhere around 4.9 to 5 billion correct me if I am wrong there, for FY 2018 so one, am I right on that and two can you just talk about cash flows and why they improve so meaningfully in the second half of the year?","Karen Parkhill","For FY 2018 you're approximately right, we would expect high single digit growth compounded annually from FY 2016 on a comparable basis. So slightly high but you can do the math from FY 2016 with that growth rate.","I would say on our free cash flow, know that we typically generate about a third of our free cash flow in the first half that's what we did last year what we're seeing right now. So we do remain confident about our ability to continue to grow in the high single digits from FY 2016 compounded annually.","There have been some effects in the first half that we outlined on our fourth quarter earnings call. We expect a significant tax and legal settlement in FY 2018 most of that did occur in the first half of this fiscal year. We also had some payments fall into the first half that were in the second half of last year on a comparable basis specifically a couple hundred million related to the timing of the pension plan contributions, it happened in Q2 of this year versus Q3 of the prior year. And we also had some additional tax payment this first half.","And then keep in mind that the divestiture of our businesses also had an impact of cash flow with both divestiture related expenses and foregone cash related to divestiture.","Mike Weinstein","And Karen just so we have it, what is the FY 2016 free cash flow number that you are using obviously adjusted for the divestiture do you know that?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, it is in the slide deck and it is 4.2 of free cash flow and if you look at it on a comparable free cash flow basis with the divestiture impact of about 100 million a quarter it nets to 3.9.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just two questions from me, maybe I\u2019ll start with Geoff on RTG. Geoff kind of it\u2019s a two part question RTG related to market growth rates versus your performance, so spine obviously doing worse from a market growth perspective, SCS doing better from a market growth perspective. How do you think about the trends in those two businesses in the next two to four quarters and do you still think you can trend slightly above market in spine and with Intellis is the way to think about that getting back to market growth rates or just getting back to positive territory and I have a quick one for Karen?","Geoff Martha","So thanks, I\u2019ll take the spine one first. We definitely see a pullback in the market here over the last couple quarters from I\u2019ll call it 2% flat to slightly down. We still feel very confident about our ability to perform above that and it comes from two things, one continued product launches and launching them at scale which has worked for us over the last let's say five or six quarters.","So betting on the product launches, making sure with the appropriate sets, making sure we\u2019ve done the appropriate training of our reps and the physicians and launching with force and that's really helped us. And as we move forward, the surgical synergies is really taking hold, that's the combination of all of our enabling technology, power, navigation, robotics and that is having a halo effect and actually a tangible pull-through affect on our implants.","We do a lot of equipment placements and that we've done over the last two or three quarters, now it will continue over the next year. And a year from now or so we'll have actually technological ties between our implants in the Mazor robots. So we feel really good about where we are in spine. I'd like to see the market go up because we given our market share globally at 30 so percent that would help but we feel good about our ability to continue to perform above the market.","The other thing I\u2019ll point out is that, I think Omar mentioned it if you combine our enabling technologies with our implants we're really growing and that's how a lot of our competitors look like Globus, NuVasive et cetera that put us to about 2% growth. So we feel good.","And then we have a high exposure to the global markets. The global markets outside the U.S. are growing three times as fast as the U.S. markets and we have a pretty high exposure there and are doing well. So overall spine, we feel good. I wish the market were growing a little faster though.","And in Pain stem, pain pumps, the end pain stem actually are experiencing a lot of acceleration here in the last quarter. Pain stem because of the launch of Intellis, we already have launched our evolved work flow. And that does get us from mid-single digit to high single-digit declines to I would say low to mid-single-digit growth not quite growing at the market yet. I think that\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. But we feel very good about, for the next couple of quarters, well going forward here mid-single-digit growth in pain stem.","And then pain pumps with the listing of the certificate of medical need that is really given that business a boost plus all of the products, the enhancements that we\u2019ve launched over the last couple of quarters, we can, - re-launching that product as its kind of a new product if you will, and that\u2019s picked up quite a bit of steam and now growing at like high single digits.","So the pain business has really experienced a pretty rapid turnaround here in the last quarter.","David Lewis","Then quickly carrying on, I appreciate the early comments you gave us on next year\u2019s guidance. Just in terms of thinking about that mid-single-digit corporate profile, how should we think about or what allotments did you make for various ex-U.S. pricing headwinds, whether they be China, India where the biannual Japan price cuts. Was there allotments made in that sort of mid-single digit range for those dynamics next year?","Karen Parkhill","Yes we continue to have pricing pressure across all of our businesses and geographies and that is taken into consideration when we give our longer-term guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","So two questions, I will start with Karen if okay, and to echo David\u2019s comments I appreciate some of the early commentary on fiscal 2019 on both revenue growth and currency. I am just curious on the earnings front though for 2019, is there any reason not to expect that sort of 10% earnings growth in fiscal \u201819 off of what I realize is a pro forma restated 2018, that $0.07 you were talking about. But just curious if there is any reason not to expect that sort of 10% growth in fiscal \u201819 off of that new base?","Karen Parkhill","Bob, we are currently working on our long-range forecast and our annual plan for next year. So we'll give much better guidance in the normal timeframe. But in the meantime we clearly do continue to expect to drive that mid-single-digit revenue growth and significant operating margin expansion that should lead to very robust bottom line growth.","Bob Hopkins","So I guess for my second question, Omar, I was wondering if you could make a comment on just sort of what you're seeing in terms of MedTech market growth rates generally both in the United States and in emerging markets and to some degree this follows on the last question little bit given the China pricing announcement on ICDs and stents.","But Omar, could you just talk broadly of what the trends you're seeing currently in the U.S. and emerging markets as it relates to just broadly speaking MedTech market growth?","Omar Ishrak","Let me start with emerging markets Bob. You know look, the growth in emerging markets continues and we are delivering in that diversified position across the major markets of China, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. You know these are big markets where we've got significant positions and are fairly well diversified.","Given that backdrop we see ourselves going in the double-digit, say in a sustained fashion in emerging markets powered by markets that are pretty robust. Now there may be variations from year-to-year in the different markets as we have experienced but we have also shown that those variations are manageable, they are not that big. They\u2019re still close to that range.","And China market is perhaps going to be at sometime in the future the biggest market in MedTech. And it is one that to we expect to participate and work with stakeholders there and are confident that we can continue our performance thereof delivering double-digit revenue growth.","So emerging markets we are pretty confident about and feel very good about our position for sustained delivery. The U.S. on one side the overall markets outside of spine are the surgical volumes are basically the same, around 1% to 2% with small variations which we really don\u2019t want to try to forecast at that precision level.","And the spine market you just heard Geoff say has got some pressure in the U.S. for a variety of reasons probably, in the elective procedures may be being one of them. But more importantly the U.S. market in the end is driven by new product introductions and we have seen that and we are experiencing that right now.","With our new product cycles, that drives the U.S. market and that's the most significant impact that we see. So that\u2019s the way I see markets, I mean not that different from what you have seen before, a lot that we can influence ourselves by our own actions and that's what we focus on doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","I was wondering if you could go over a little bit more specifically in the diabetes business. Just what, how you're feeling about the reacceleration? How confident you are and then maybe just touch on what gives that confidence for next year to grow in the double-digit range. Just kind of the path forward to bring some of the new supply onto the market for the sensors?","Mike Coyle","Kristen I'd say, you know first let\u2019s start with the back half of this year and then we can talk about the FY 2019. I'd say the acceleration that we expect in the back half of the year is really driven by three things. The first one is that our sensor capacity plans are actually not only going according to plan but slightly ahead of schedule. And so we anticipate that we are going to be in a position by the end of this fiscal year where our sensor capacity will allow us to meet all of the demand, so that's one. So as we get that back up we expect to see acceleration not only of sensor revenue but also of pump revenue.","The second one is the 670G and you know the real world performance of 670G as more of those systems get into the market. This is a system that now has 13,000 patients that are uploading their data into CareLink and what's really encouraging Kristen, is that what we\u2019re seeing even at these volumes is outcomes and performance that are very similar to what we saw in the pivotal trial for the FDA. And so as those things really start to continue to take hold I think both from a physician perspective and a patient perspective, we will start to see traction.","And then the third dynamic for the back half of the year which will also go into FY \u201919 is Animas and the transition of those patients to Medtronic. And then as we look forward into FY 2019 as Omar mentioned, there's a series of new product launches in addition to all of these dynamics that I just mentioned.","Guardian Connect and our entry into the standalone sensor market number one, iPro 3, which will be a new professional CGM for our Type 2 business. You combine all of these things and we feel good about the acceleration into the second half and also double-digits for FY 2019.","Kristen Stewart","So you have full sensor supply for fiscal fourth quarter or ahead?","Mike Coyle","That's right. So we are going to ramp up and Q3 should be better than Q2. So we - our capacity expansion plans will allow us to produce more sensors this quarter than we did last quarter. And then by Q4 will be in a position where we can meet all of the demand.","Kristen Stewart","And then Karen there is a question for you. Can you maybe just go through the dynamics year-over-year just kind of the gross margin the puts and takes of those?","Karen Parkhill","We do expect our gross margin to be relatively flat year-over-year FY 2017 to FY 2018 and the real puts and takes are the fact that we see continued pricing pressure but remain focused on driving expense reduction in our COGS line item.","Kristen Stewart","And when you mentioned for the full year I think you had said with respect to the guidance for, with respect to the hedges. Did you mean that that was going to be negative impacts from hedges with FX for the third quarter or was that positive?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, from an FX perspective we talked about it on the operating margin perspective, and we said that our third and fourth quarter operating margin would be negatively affected by 50 to 100 basis points. But the fourth quarter impact a little bit greater than the third and that's assuming rates remain constant to where they are today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","One follow-up on China, and one of robotics. So Omar I just wanted to ask you directly about the proposed price cuts to drug-eluting stents hips and ICDs. You know we've heard the price cuts could be up to 40% but offset by the two invoice policy. How are you thinking about those pending changes in China and the potential for other device categories that have similar cuts? And then I have one follow-up on robotics.","Omar Ishrak","Again on China look let's not forget the size of that market and access to healthcare for patients in China is a big priority for the government and a big priority for us. And we are working closely with the government to figure out the best way to optimize the distribution channels which has many factors as you noted, and now there may be certain price regulations but we're used to managing those and we feel the end that our ability to demonstrate value and our experience with value-based models will give us the right pricing in those markets, and the right trade-off between price and volume, as well as you know leading out the cost in the distribution channel working together with the government.","So the many variables here in the end we feel pretty confident that we can maintain our performance in China through these dynamics which will change over time. It's a big market and a lot of work has to be done but through that we feel that we've got a team in place and products in place and a focus in place through which we can continuously deliver.","Larry Biegelsen","And then on robotics, I heard your comments about doing first-in-human, I think in fiscal 2018 if I heard correctly, but my question is are you still planning to launch in select international markets this year? And I think at the last analyst meeting, you said you expect to draw robotic program that contribute 50 to 150 basis points of growth in fiscal 2019 which I think at the time equated to about 50 to 150 million in revenues. I guess the question is, are you still comfortable with that? Thanks for taking the questions.","Omar Ishrak","I\u2019ll let Brian answer that robotic question. Go ahead Brian.","Bryan Hanson","We obviously have a pretty complex project on our hands with a lot of moving pieces and parts on the robotics system quite literally actually, a lot of moving pieces and parts. And so there is always risk in slippage for launch but at this point in time we're sticking to the dates that we have committed to relative to launch timelines which would be consistent with what you said first-in-human at the end of this fiscal year and in full launch in FY 2019.","So we are pretty excited and I would tell you just even going further beyond that, I probably feel more confident now about the robotic system then I have it any point in the past the fact that we're going have a viable and really competitive product and I will tell you why?","We're already building our pilot systems off the production line. So we've already built and are continuing to build those pilot systems write off the production line. We are well passed any design development fees at this point where fully into verification and validation and although there's a lot of work ahead of us, the work really is more associated which is time to retire the work and the risk of a viable product is behind us.","So we're not having a viable product is behind us. So I feel very confident about where we are. I feel very confident we're going to have not just a viable product but we continue to do so surgeon feedback and the feedback that we're getting from surgeons is that they're very excited about the technology that we have and I look forward to its launch.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Wonder if I could just ask around the U.S. growth in MITG. It was down 5% even after correcting for the hurricanes, it was still a negative results in the U.S. and so I am curious if that's a reflection of perhaps procedure volumes or something else happening now that we're seeing in that market?","Bryan Hanson","So it's less around procedural volumes because where we see a lot of pressure in our business in Q2, one obviously was a result of some of the pressure that we saw because of the hurricanes, a lot of that concentrated on the surgical business but even through that pressure we saw pretty good strength in the surgical business overall.","The real pressure came in the RGR business which specifically the biggest piece of that which is respiratory where we had some really challenging comps from last year as you probably remember we had relaunched the PB980 in Q2. We had real strength last year as a result of that and that carry through in Q3 and Q4 and as expected we saw some challenging growth rates in Q2 as a result of that.","But I don\u2019t see anything fundamentally in the procedures that we leverage to drive revenue that would be concerning for me.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair.","Kaila Krum","So first I got starting off on emerging market any constraints that you guys saw in the quarter. Can you just speak a little bit more to the durability of that double-digit performance and I know that you don\u2019t give too much color on fiscal 2019 but just high leveling and taking into account some of the anticipated headwinds you\u2019ve mentioned. Is it fair to assume that sort of growth continues in the next year?","Omar Ishrak","First let me take the emerging markets, like I said we've demonstrated double-digit performance in the emerging markets almost on a quarterly basis now for - I don\u2019t know five years. So we have every expectation that that will continue because our position in these markets is only strengthening and there is no question about the need, you know you just need to look at the math based on population and the market requirement of our therapies and the need is clearly there.","And we\u2019re working closely with different stakeholders - we continue to work closely with different stakeholders in these markets to create methods through which access is provided going beyond our products, working with the government, as well as private providers to facilitate training of physicians, to creation of infrastructure, as well as creating awareness for our therapies.","So we're pretty confident that this double-digit emerging market growth will continue given the size of that opportunity and given the diversification that we have across the different major emerging markets.","I think the second question in terms of growth into next year the color that we provided really goes down to our three growth strategies built on a reliable and emerging market growth coupled with our new product launches that will become more. So uniform across our different groups, led by a strong recovery in diabetes, but also good improvement in both MITG and RTG like we mentioned. I think all of this put together gives us confidence that we can continue our mid single-digit growth trajectory that's in our short and long-term plans.","Kaila Krum","And then I guess it was in spine, I mean clearly you\u2019re continuing to put up solid growth in the biologic segment of your business and you\u2019re investing those incremental dollars in field research. But I guess there is some question is that the value of biologics as more companies introduce porous or titanium technologies that they require less biologic use, so I guess what's your view on that dynamic longer-term? Thank you.","Bryan Hanson","Look I think there is a lot more research that needs to be done on the impact of the surface technologies in the porous surface edgings on some of the inner bodies, but we'll also participate in that market as well. We're just launching our first titanium porous cage and so we\u2019re watching it.","I think though that to dismiss the use of some of the biologics is premature based on the results we've seen over the last decade. And we\u2019re so confident that we're investing $90 million over the next several years in clinical research.","We feel very good about it but we are intrigued on the surface coatings and we\u2019re going to invest in that as well, but I think dismissing the biologics, the existing biologics is a little premature and I think more of the questions are some of the new claims around stem cells and things like that, that is where the pressure is that's what we\u2019re seeing.","We\u2019re not seeing it for example on Infuse, if that\u2019s the question. We are hearing about it in some of the new stem cell related products that there is pushback from the payers, but in terms of existing biologics we feel that we have proven track record and we're confident thus investing in more clinical data. And the porous technology is intriguing but there's still lot to prove on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Josh Jennings","Just had a question for Mike Coyle, congrats on the CVG performance in the quarter. Having concerns, some concerns about competitors of ICD launches and for the CRM business specifically, it sounds like that competitor had almost limited in the quarter but just wanted to hear if you had any updated thoughts on your competitive positioning and ability to defend the share gains you capture for the last two years and did you see any impact from those launches in October?","Mike Coyle","Josh thanks for the question. As you mentioned those products were launched in mid-to-late September by both of our competitors and so we now have eight or nine weeks of experience with the launches and frankly we have not seen a lot of impact on our unit share in the high power segment.","And I think there are a number of reasons why that is true, the first is that the competitive offerings that they have are really not matching up to what we already have in the market, it's not just the three test labeling that we have, but also they have very significant labeling restrictions on their product and workflow negatives when you try to implement to their labeling.","And that obviously it works to our advantage but probably the bigger reason there hasn\u2019t been a meaningful detectable shift is that this really was just labeling expansion, it\u2019s really the same products that they have been selling and their field had done a good job I think of indicating to customers that when they got the approval for MRI say that they would be able to basically perform MRIs on implants even before the approval right.","So that basically put them in a position where we never saw the kind of share shift that we saw in Brady, where they was a special lead and they had to wait until they had actual approval of the product before they could start selling it.","So most of the share shift that we've seen from our product line is really come from features that are embedded in our devices that are highly differentiated like our busy AF or the smart shot technology that we have or the adaptive effective CRT features and these features have not been matched up with the products that have come in from competitor.","So they represent 70% to 80% of our product mix, so we were not expecting to see a big - major share shift away from us as MRI labeling came in from competitors and at least eight or nine weeks into the launch we have seen that happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Omar just wondering if you could comment on your views for the overall healthcare utilization environment in electric procedures in particular. Just kind of curious what\u2019s baked into your outlook for the back half of the fiscal year? And the reason I ask is, the managed care and kind of provider community has struck - I would say a little more cautious tone on the quarter that they trend here as we went into the end of the year and it seems like the device companies have been a little bit more constructive around their expectations for underlying trend. So if you kind of maybe spend a minute reconciling that view a little bit as to what you're seeing that will be helpful?","Omar Ishrak","Well like I mentioned before, some of our procedures are acute procedures that are needed. It's almost on an emergency basis and those procedures will continue and there's a demographic statistical need for that and we don't see that changing if anything with the demographics will even increase slightly.","And then beyond that you have core surgical procedures like I said some of which were elective but most of it - is required and there we\u2019re seeing a pretty steady performance in the marketplace. The spine area which I think is probably because of the elective nature of some of those procedures, we seen some pressure but not completely out of line with what we\u2019ve seen historically in different phases and one that we expect to stabilize going forward.","So from a procedural perspective we don't really see that much change, some shifts between the different areas that we're in primarily I think driven by the elective nature of some of these procedures. I think overall though like I mentioned before and I want to emphasize new product introductions in MedTech in general drive the market far more than these shifts and that\u2019s what going to see us get the kind of accelerated growth that we are projecting into the second half and into next year.","Isaac Ro","And then Mike maybe a follow up for you on TAVR, just curious what\u2019s baked into your outlook for the rest of the fiscal year in the U.S. and Europe for that business it\u2019s obviously done well in the last couple of quarters here in competitive landscape does figure to shift again as we move into calendar 2018 so be interested in kind of how your game planning for TAVR in the contest of your guidance? Thank you.","Mike Coyle","We're obviously fairly early into the launch of Evolut PRO both in Europe and in the United States really which the last quarter was really the first full quarter for that product. It\u2019s doing exceptionally well in terms of not only the improvements in lower paravalvular leak rates but the physicians are really being able to use that system to have lower pacemaker rates as well.","So we really feel well positioned relative to our product line now obviously with both Evolut R and Evolut PRO available to our customers. And obviously the intermediate risk approval in the United States allowed us to really access where the growth in the market is and now we're expanding centers to basically take advantage of that. And then obviously the Evolut R approval in Japan is also driving significant growth.","So the overall market remains robust in through the low to mid 20s and obviously we are in share capture mode, we think our product lines are well positioned to compete against any new entrants that come into the marketplace and obviously we continue to invest and expanded indications for use including low risk and looking at things like bicuspid indication. So we think there is plenty of room for continued expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro with RBC Capital.","Glenn Navarro","A question for Karen on tax reform. Medtronic had an advantage versus competitors given its inverted status. So Karen, based on what you're seeing out of Washington D.C. in tax reform today, I wonder if you can give some of your initial thoughts on reform. Does it - what part of reform helps Medtronic? Is there any part of reform that puts you at a disadvantage? Thank you.","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for the question Glenn. We pleased that Congress is working on potential tax reform right now. We do continue to support reform in general including the establishment of a territorial system and a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. As you know, the House has advanced its potential reform with the passage of a bill and the Senate has only just released last night its legislative draft.","But we recognize that both Houses need to reconcile their versions into one bill so we are staying very close to this process. I would say it\u2019s too early to speculate on the final version of the bill and its impact if any to us but the most positive impact of potential reform to us in the long-term would be the ongoing access to our OUS cash that is limited obviously today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matt Taylor","Karen I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the things that impacted operating margin that you called out in the prepared remarks this quarter to help us quantify kind of the temporary impact of those product launch support programs and the hurricane. And then you eluded to you beyond the Covidien synergies some additional thing that you can do in operating margin. Can you give us any clarity on what those are and if there any different from what you laid out in the prior plan?","Karen Parkhill","So we did talk about a margin decline that we had this quarter and that was really driven by four things, the impact of lower revenue - lighter revenue in our diabetes business along with the impact of the hurricane, as well as the infusion set recall in diabetes.","And so going forward we do expect to improve our operating margins particularly this year in the back half substantially more in the fourth quarter. And that is really driven by the strength of revenue along with our continued focus on driving cost synergies and driving cost down where we can.","Looking longer-term we do expect to continue to drive operating margin improvement as we\u2019ve discussed in the past beyond the delivery of the Covidien synergies which we expect to close out this fiscal year. And the movement that we expect to do going forward is continued plant consolidation, increase used of shared service, continued focus on our enabling functions on a global basis driving center of excellence and improving our processes et cetera. So we do expect to continue to drive margin expansion going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Can you tell us sort of or share with us philosophically how you think about guidance I appreciate your verbiage in the prepared remarks regarding of you towards consistency but as we think about the second half of the year and then your remarks going into next year what you depreciated, how do you think about putting all of those pieces to the puzzle together?","Omar Ishrak","Well like we mentioned we feel that we've got a set of businesses driven by growth strategies of therapy innovation of emerging market growth and of - drive towards value based healthcare which helps us with pricing and some new business models. You take all three of those things together across the spread of our businesses, we feel that we can deliver on the mid single-digit growth and I think we've demonstrated that, we've had issues in certain quarters for a variety of reasons and which we\u2019re not happy about but in general on a yearly basis we certainly delivered that and we have every expectation that that will continue.","And to do that that this fiscal year we need an acceleration in the second half which we have line of sight to given the new product launches and the dynamics that we see in our different businesses. So really is a straightforward as that, we think our new products fill this on a base of strong double-digit emerging markets growth.","Joanne Wuensch","And just as quick follow up, of the new products which are the two or three you really think are the drivers for the next 12 to 18 months. And then thank you.","Omar Ishrak","It varies quite a bit - as we go through the next 12 to 18 months but CVG and cardiovascular we continue to have traction and our CoreValve Evolut PRO in TAVR in addition to the intermediate risk approval that we got is driving both market growth, as well as our own share position in the U.S. and across the world.","We're really excited about our HVAD destination therapy approval that's a real game changer for us in that market and we're pleased with the success that we've seen with that product line. And then also repeating the Micra leadless pacemaker, which is the only leadless pacemaker that exist and we continue to benefit from full CMS reimbursement for that product in the U.S. and we're seeing a very strong growth in that segment as well.","So all three of those areas in CVG continue to grow in addition to the other product lines. So we're pretty confident that will go on. There will be dynamics through the different quarters that we go through the year it will be higher earlier in the next 12 months rather than later in CVG.","But then that\u2019s supplemented by continued growth in MITG where we have regular cadence of launches that we're seeing deliver successful results specifically in surgical innovations but the other businesses also are contributing.","And in RTG, in addition to the capital equipment that we\u2019ve talked about like the StealthStation S8 and the O-arm and to some degree our partnership with Mazor Robotics, we also have Intellis platform that we should really look at which is a big turnaround and take us towards positive growth in spinal cord stimulation. In addition to the removal of the warning letter and the consent decree requirements that were in place for the pain pump in that product line.","And then finally in diabetes, we've gone through a fairly difficult phase mostly to do with our supply shortage in sensors but very strong demand from patients for our highly differentiated technology. And we\u2019re only in the beginning stages of the growth in diabetes with that kind of differentiated hybrid closed loop technology.","And in addition to that, we\u2019re supplementing that with our Guardian Connect with sugar IQ product which is a CGM product to be launched in the U.S. sometime later this fiscal year which is highly differentiated from anything that\u2019s available in the market.","So you put all that together, we see that while the relative dynamics of the different businesses may vary quarter-to-quarter, overall we've got enough diversification in the markets that we serve that we can maintain the mid-single-digit growth.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","One for Omar or maybe Mike, and then one quick one for Karen. Omar you highlighted the expansion of value-based contracts in CRM, based on your estimates it likely event rates into those contracts, what's the implied net impact on your pricing. Is this a situation where you're effectively getting a price increase by taking risk off the hands of the hospital and if so can you quantify that?","Omar Ishrak","Yes, I think a better way to look at that is to - so we demonstrate the translation of the clinical value to economic value in the financials of the hospital that's what we\u2019re doing. The clinical value is reduced reintervention rates for example for which we've got evidence, we\u2019re not just guessing this we\u2019ve got clinical trial evidence that shows that and that translated to the financials of the hospital is our value base healthcare program where the variables are highly technology driven or innovation driven.","So then few other variables, our technology we know through evidence and clinical trials create this improved clinical benefit which we then translate to the hospitals financials as an economic benefit. And we think that through that, indeed pricing is not only protected but to some degree we would get enhanced overall pricing because in the end the hospital is better off financially with this new technology than without, that\u2019s the essence of value based healthcare programs.","And we\u2019ve - as the overall payment model changes, we\u2019re gaining a lot of experience as to how to create these contracts with providers in the existing fee-for-service model. As we translate more to a pay-for-value model, we think we\u2019ll be very well positioned to even broaden the scope of these business arrangements.","Chris Pasquale","And then Karen, you bought back a lot of stock in the first half of the year. I know a piece of that was sort of one time and tied to the PMR proceeds, but if I do the math on the free cash flow guidance and then add in a dividends in the back half of the year, it looks like you're on track to basically return a 100% of free cash flow to shareholders for the third straight year. How sustainable is that as we look ahead to 2019?","Karen Parkhill","Our commitment on return to shareholders is greater than 50% of our actual free cash flow that we generate, and while we did use a portion of our divestiture proceeds to repurchase stock which does elevate our return to shareholders this year, going forward we would expect to stick with that greater than 50% of free cash flow commitment.","Omar Ishrak","Okay, so with that let's close the call up. Thank you very much for all your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your families a very Happy Thanksgiving. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 20. Thank you all very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Warren, vice president, investor relations. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Warren","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s chief financial officer; will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2014 third quarter, which ended January 24, 2014. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. ","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. ","Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.","With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $4.2 billion, which represents growth of 4% and Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91. Our Q3 revenue growth was at the upper end of our full year revenue outlook, and was in line with our mid-single digit baseline executions.","We remain focused on building a track record of operational execution to deliver consistent and reliable results. In Q3, our overall organization once again delivered balanced growth, with strong performances in some areas more than offsetting challenges in the other parts of our business. ","Looking ahead, we\u2019re confident that our three primary strategies - therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value - will further strengthen, diversify, and expand our market leading competitive position. As we have recently discussed, we are actively translating these strategies into distinct growth vectors, which when combined with our disciplined capital allocation, position us well to create long term value in healthcare.","Looking more closely at our Q3 results, it is important to note that all eight of our primary businesses were stable or growing, with a trend of increasing stabilization in certain businesses continuing to play out. ","This was particular evident in our spine business. Global spine results were flat this quarter, driven in part by improved BMP sales that were down 1%. While this result reflects sequential stability in underlying demand for BMP, it is worth noting that we did face a favorable year over year comparison, as Gary will discuss later.","Our diabetes grew 16%, driven by the strong launch in the U.S. of the MiniMed 530 G system with the Enlite sensor. In addition, surgical technologies delivered another outstanding performance in Q3, growing 11%. All three of these businesses, BMP, neurosurgery, and advanced energy, continued to execute and contribute solid growth.","At the same time, we continued to deal with some challenges this quarter. In renal denervation, we announced in January that our HTN-3 trial failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. The HTN-3 results will be presented at ATC on March 29, and we have convened an independent panel of experts to review the data and provide us additional insights of potential next steps for this business.","In our peripherals business, we suffered a setback in our below the knee drug eluting balloon program, where we had some unexpected clinical results. In light of these results, we\u2019ve pulled our below the knee DEB from the market. We strongly believe the issues are unique to below the knee, and remain confident in our SFA program. ","In fact, multiple studies, 14 presented and 6 published, support positive, consistent outcomes for our DEB in VSFA. Both the HTN-3 and below the knee clinical results did affect the Q3 revenue growth of their respective businesses, and also, when compared to our earlier expectations, have a combined, modest 15 basis point negative impact on our overall Q3 growth.","While these clinical trial outcomes are disappointing, it is important to realize that we still have a substantial number of exciting growth drivers in our upcoming product pipeline that can help us deliver on our mid-single digit revenue growth expectations. ","In emerging markets, our overall Q3 growth was 12%, and now represents 13% of our total company sales. While this is respectable, and contributed a point and a half to our overall company growth, our Q3 results fell short of our targeted mid to high teens growth rate. As in Q2, we faced the most pressure in our central and eastern Europe region, which declined 2% this quarter.","This was primarily driven by Russia, where changes in fiscal funding mechanisms are negatively affecting healthcare budgets. We are, however, seeing definite signs of improvement in Russia, and expect our overall central and eastern Europe regions to return to strong double-digit growth in the upcoming quarters.","Despite the market challenges we have faced recently, we remain confident in our overall outlook for emerging markets. We\u2019re working on a number of specific programs aimed at reaching our targeted levels of growth.","Turning to our P&L, our organization once again delivered on the bottom line. We generated 40 basis points of operating leverage on a year over year basis, after adjusting for the impact of foreign currency. ","On our gross margin line, we had an 80 basis point sequential improvement in Q3, as we resolved the Q2 issue of higher scrap and obsolescence from the manufacturing ramp of new products. And foreign exchange had less of a negative impact. ","At the same time, we continue to have elevated levels of spending to address quality system improvements, and expect this to continue for several quarters. While these efforts are costly, ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has, and always will be, a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic.","Turning to our cash flow, we have generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow fiscal year to date, and over the next five years, we expect to get over $25 billion of free cash flow. While revenue growth is the largest level we have for enhancing our cash flow, we also are driving operational efficiencies such as our working capital improvement program, which is targeting increasing our inventory turns by 50% by FY17.","We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a commitment level we believe is appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. ","This mix continues to be constrained by U.S. tax policy, which creates a negative incentive for us to repatriate cash into the U.S. The remaining 50% gives us ample flexibility to make attractive investments to drive sustainable growth over the long term. ","We remain disciplined in how we deploy our capital, with a strong focus on strategic alignment and high return metrics, while minimizing near-term shareholder dilution. ","As we look into the future, we\u2019re convinced that our three strategic priorities - therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value - will not only increase our competitive advantage in the evolving healthcare environment, but also offer real solutions, namely to improve clinical outcomes, expand access, and optimize cost and efficiency to healthcare systems around the world.","As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re translating these strategies into three growth vectors, each delivering independent revenue streams. Our first growth vector is our strong upcoming product launch cadence, fueled by our therapy innovation strategy, which represents our core strength and continued foundation for growth. ","Over the coming quarters, we will bring a number of new products to market. In TIDM, we recently launched Reveal Linq in international markets and are expecting FDA approval any day. Reveal Linq is a significant advancement in device miniaturization, with a size nearly 90% smaller than the previous generation, which allows for a simple, minimally invasive insertion. We believe this discreet device will allow us to further expand our upstream footprint in cardiac diagnostics, especially in AF, syncope, cryptogenic stroke, and heart failure.","In Q3, we also initiated the global clinical trial for Micra, the world\u2019s smallest leadless pacemaker. Data from this trial is expected to lead to CE mark by the end of FY15 and will also be submitted for FDA approval. In fact, our first U.S. Micra implant is scheduled for later this week. ","Micra\u2019s is a true innovation in pacing, and features a novel fixation specifically designed for this new approach to prevent dislodgement while supplementing repositioning and [unintelligible] retrieval.","In our structural heart business, we received early FDA approval in Q3 for our CoreValve transcatheter valve for three different access routes - transfemoral, subclavian, and direct aortic - in extreme risk patients, and we continue to expect CoreValve U.S. approval for high-risk patients by mid-FY15.","CoreValve is able to treat a much broader range of patients than our competitor\u2019s U.S. offering, as it is suitable for nearly all patient valve sizes, and its low profile 18-French delivery system makes it possible to treat patients with difficult or small vasculature.","This is also a uniquely differentiated valve in terms of its self-expanding design, controlled delivery, hemodynamics that improve over time, and lower rates of major stroke and paravalvular leak. ","In intravascular, we\u2019re expecting clinical results for our Impact Admiral drug eluting balloon for the SFA to be presented at the Charing Cross Symposium in early April, and are targeting a U.S. launch in early FY16.","In spine, we expect to launch our Prestige LP next-generation cervical disc in the U.S. this summer. We\u2019re also planning to enhance our interbody and cervical plate offerings with a series of launches in FY15. ","In neuromodulation, we continue to see strong adoption of our SureScan MRI [pain stimulator] in the U.S. and we are now launching this product in Japan.","In surgical technologies, we are developing a full pipeline of new power imaging and navigation equipment focused on improving both clinical and economic value in demanding medical procedures involving Medtronic therapies. ","In diabetes, in addition to the ongoing launch of the MiniMed 530 G system with the Enlite sensor in the U.S., we are demonstrating our innovation in CGM with our Enlite enhanced sensor, which is now launching in international markets. ","This sensor will complement our MiniMed 640 G, which we intend to launch in international markets in the first half of FY15. The MiniMed 640 G is our next-generation insulin pump system, featuring a new look and feel and a simplified user interface and the predictive low glucose Suspend algorithm. ","Looking across the portfolio, we feel that we\u2019re positioned to deliver what is arguable one of the strongest launch cadences of innovative therapies in our industry. While innovative therapies remain central to our success and have fueled growth in our industry for decades, it will no longer be enough going forward.","In order to unlock the full potential of medtech, to serve more patients and deliver better value in the transforming healthcare environment, we are taking meaningful action to advance our globalization and economic value strategies. ","We believe successful execution of both of these strategies will position us to win in the changing healthcare marketplace and will be instrumental in establishing durability in our long term performance while creating the potential for upside to our baseline expectations. ","With globalization, we are committed to unlocking the large opportunity for our existing therapies in emerging markets, and this effort represents our second independent growth vector. We remain focused on the premium segment in emerging markets, where both the medical technology and the ability to pay already exist.","This segment of emerging markets represents a multibillion dollar annual opportunity alone, and these are markets where our margins are comparable to our developed markets. In these regions of the world, we are being creative and resourceful as we continue to pursue traditional local market development activities as well as engaging in new and unique business [unintelligible] innovations such as novel commercial collaborations, strategic channel management, and developing unique public-private partnerships. Each of these has the potential to drive upside to our emerging market growth. ","Finally, we see a continued drive by many progressive payers, hospital systems, and governments to adopt new value-based systems for healthcare delivery and payment. The formation of new value-based healthcare systems and models requires us to think and act differently in terms of how we engage payers, providers, and governments, and the role of innovation within these models. ","In the end, we believe this shift to value comes with significant opportunity, and our selective efforts to aim at this shift fall into our economic value strategy. Our response to this shift in models will undoubtedly include the continued focus on delivering proven core technologies, but at the same time, we\u2019re also expanding our offerings to new services and solutions, which is our third independent growth vector.","These services and solutions may be combined with our technologies, or they may stand alone. They are focused on a broader set of decision makers, such as hospital administrators and payers, with the goal of delivering low cost, high quality, and better patient outcomes.","To begin with, we have targeted two important areas where we can immediately offer solutions for healthcare systems around the world: integrated care and hospital solutions. In integrated care, our Cardiocom acquisition is performing well and delivering strong growth. Cardiocom continues to enlarge contracts, and is a compelling value proposition for a number of different customers including government, hospital systems, and health plans.","In Q3, Cardiocom launched [unintelligible], a 30-day readmission reduction program focused on minimizing heart failure readmission penalties for U.S. hospitals. Cardiocom is a proven, cost-effective, noninvasive solution that can easily be applied to all healthcare systems\u2019 heart failure patients.","In the area of hospital solutions, we are starting to see good early results from our new cath lab managed services business in Europe. This business provides a unique service offering, whereby we enter into long term contracts with hospitals to upgrade and more effectively manage their cath lab and hybrid operating rooms. ","This is expected to result in wins for all stakeholders. The hospital sees an improvement in cath lab efficiency and profitability, and physicians get access to the latest technology they need for better patient outcomes. Medtronic benefits not only through the increased use of our technology, but also through incremental service revenue, reduced pricing pressure, better inventory management, and more efficient use of our service personnel.","While it is still early, we continue to sign up accounts for long term cath lab managed service contracts. Combined, these contracts now represent over $350 million in incremental revenue over a seven-year time horizon. We are particularly encouraged by the positive reaction in the market to our offering and have built a solid pipeline of potential deals.","Another solution that we are now offering hospital customers is TYRX, which we acquired in Q3. This proprietary technology dramatically reduces infections that can result from device implants, which not only improves patient outcomes and hospitals\u2019 quality metrics, but also reduces the significant costs associated with these complications. We intend to leverage this technology initially in CRDM, but ultimately in other businesses such as neuromodulation. ","Ultimately, medical technology has the potential to transform healthcare from being a cost burden for most societies to an economic driver. Nations can achieve better long term economic output by utilizing medical technology to more effectively and efficiently restore health to the sick and manage chronic disease to keep their populations healthy, allowing more people to be contributing members of society.","Furthermore, Medtronic is uniquely positioned to lead the shift in value-based healthcare, directing our products and solutions to help providers, payers, and governments achieve their goals and driving more value to healthcare systems around the world. The new services and solutions offerings that I have described earlier, in conjunction with many other efforts, are being well received and distinguishing Medtronic as a serious, credible partner to those who are committed to transforming healthcare systems.","We have a number of advantages to offer, including market-leading products in large, chronic disease spaces, clinical and healthcare economics expertise, Lean Sigma resources, as well as the financial strength that gives us the ability to make capital infusions into providers and enter into risk-sharing business models.","I\u2019m pleased with the early work we have done to establish our leadership position and know that there are tremendous opportunities ahead as we transform Medtronic from being primarily a device provider today into the premier global medical technology solutions partner for tomorrow. ","Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our results, before we take your questions. Gary? ","Gary Ellis ","Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $4.153 billion increased 3.4% as reported, or 4.4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $41 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.","Q3 revenue results by region were as follows: growth in the Middle East and Africa was 20%, Latin America grew 16%, growth in greater China was 11%, south Asia grew 9%, growth in Japan was 7%, the U.S. grew 4%, growth in other Asia Pacific was 3%. The western Europe and Canada region was flat, although it\u2019s worth noting that western Europe grew 1% and central and eastern Europe declined 2%","Q3 diluted earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis, were $0.91, a decrease of 2%. This decline was primarily driven by a difficult comparison due to a prepaid tax benefit we received in Q3 last year associated with the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which also has not yet been renewed this year.","Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75, a decrease of 23%. This quarter\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP pretax adjustments included a $15 million restructuring credit from the reversal of excess restructuring reserves related to our FY13 initiative and a $200 million in-acquisition related item consisting primarily of accounting impairment charge related to certain assets already in the acquisition, partially offset by a gain resulting from the elimination of the previously reported R&D and continued consideration payments.","It is important to note that while we are still in the process of evaluating potential next steps for our renal denervation business, an accounting impairment charge was deemed necessary as the majority of the value of the renal denervation intangible assets were tied to the timing of U.S. approval.","It is also worth noting that the goodwill related to the acquisition of Ardian is being evaluated at the overall coronary business reporting unit level. Based upon the results of the annual goodwill impairment review performed in Q3, no goodwill impairment existed at this level.","In our cardiac investor group, revenue of $2.119 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in structural heart, endovascular, ICDs, and AF and others, which included growth from hospital solutions and Cardiocom, partially offset by declines in pacing.","CRDM revenue of $1.184 billion grew 2%, and included $12 million from our Q2 acquisition of Cardiocom. Worldwide ICD revenue of $655 million grew 1%. As we noted last quarter, we believe a better way to view the ICD and pacing markets is on a rolling two-quarter basis, given the variability and quarter to quarter dynamics.","Similar to last quarter, we estimate that both the U.S. and international ICD markets grew in the low single digits, reflecting continued stability. In addition, our global ICD share also remained stable, as we gained approximately 50 basis points of share internationally, offset by an approximately 50 basis points U.S. share loss.","In the U.S., our differentiated Viva XT CRTD and Evera ICD continued to increase as a percentage of our overall product mix and are helping our overall ICD pricing to remain relatively flat. ","In international markets, we continue to see strong adoption of our Viva XT CRTD with its adaptive CRT algorithm and Attain Performa Quadripolar leads in Europe and Japan. ","Pacing revenue of $439 million declined 2%. We estimate the U.S. market continues to decline in the low to mid-single digits, while the international market is growing in the low single digits on a rolling two-quarter basis.","In Japan, our share remains over 700 basis points above the level prior to our FY13 launch of the Advisa MRI pacemaker, despite new competitive MRI product launches. In Q3, we received expanded labelling for full-body MRI scans from the FDA, further extending our MR conditional device leadership in U.S. markets.","MINERVA data presented at AHA demonstrated our Advisa MRI pacemakers\u2019 exclusive AF features, MVP and reactive ATP, are associated with a significant reduction in progression to permanent AF.","AF solutions grew over 20%, as we continue to gain share in the AF market, driven by robust growth from our Arctic Front cryoablation system, which grew over 30%. In Q3, we enrolled the first patient in our VICTORY AF clinical trial which we expect to use to seek FDA approval of our phased RF system. Upon approval, this would be the first product with an FDA indication for persistent and longstanding persistent AF. Looking ahead, we intend again to launch next-gen phased RF product, PVAC Gold, in Europe before the beginning of the fiscal year.","Coronary revenue of $436 million was flat. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $280 million, including $97 million in the U.S. and $30 million in Japan. Our DES business grew 5%, outperforming the market as the strength of our Resolute Integrity drug eluting stent continues to drive broad market acceptance.","In renal denervation, targeted Q3 revenue had been modest, totaling under $30 million over the past four quarters. Based on our Q3 results, renal denervation revenue is now annualizing at less than $20 million.","In structural heart, revenue of $281 million increased 4%, driven by strong growth in our transcatheter valve franchise in international markets. We estimate that the international TAVI market is improving, growing nearly 20%, or over 20% if you normalize for the impact of Germany, where we returned to the market during the quarter.","In the U.S., the FDA granted early approval for our CoreValve transcatheter valve for extreme risk patients at the end of Q3. In Q4, we are now beginning a very safe and deliberate commercial rollout, building off our initial 60 U.S. [unintelligible] sites. We will support new sites [unintelligible] with an extensive training and education program that can last a few months per site. Looking ahead, data from our U.S. CoreValve trial for high-risk patients will be presented at ACC on March 29, and we continue to expect FDA approval in mid-FY15. ","In international markets, we are targeting the launch of the 26 mm and 29 mm version of CoreValve Evolut R, our next-generation recapturable TAVI system with a 14-French equivalent delivery system next spring, and we\u2019ll also start our U.S. [test of this] system in FY15.","In endovascular, revenue of $218 million grew 4%. Our [unintelligible] business had mid-single digit growth in the U.S. and Europe, despite the competitive pressure from new entrants. Our global and U.S. AAA shares were stable sequentially, as our Endurant II stent graft continues to lead the market.","In thoracic, our sales training efforts resulted in 300 basis points of U.S. share gain. We also just received FDA approval for an expanded initiation of our Valiant Captivia stent graft for treating aortic dissections.","Our peripherals business declined 3% in Q3, as a result of the below the knee voluntary product recall. After adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus re-entry catheter product line, as well as the impact of removing our below the knee drug eluting balloon in the market, our peripheral business grew 15%.","Now turning to our restorative therapies group, revenue of $1.608 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in surgical technologies and neuromodulation. Spine revenue of $744 million was flat. Core spine revenue of $631 million was also flat.","Excluding VKP, our core spine business grew 2% globally and grew 1% in the United States. Both the global and the U.S. spine markets appear stable, growing slightly this quarter. Our spine business continues to differentiate itself from the competition through our leading technology, enhanced by our surgical synergy program, which integrated enabling technologies from our surgical technologies business, including intraoperative imaging, navigation, and powered surgical instruments. ","Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery as they see clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures. This is resulting in solid growth of capital equipment sales in our surgical technologies business as well as increased spinal implant growth. In fact, in accounts that have adopted our surgical synergy program, core spine revenue growth is significantly higher.","Outside the United States, our Kanghui acquisition in China continues to deliver solid revenue growth in the value segments of orthopedics, which is offsetting the lost revenue from our former Weigao joint venture. Kanghui continues to grow its sales in the emerging markets outside of China, with strong growth in its trauma product lines.","BMP sales of $113 million declined 1%. While this is an improved performance on a year over year basis, it is important to note that we face a favorable comparison in Q3. Recall that in Q3 last year, our results were affected by the inability to fulfill hospital bulk orders due to a supply constraint of sterile water, which resulted in some sales shifting from Q3 to Q4. While we see signs of sequential stability in the underlying demand for BMP, we face a difficult comparison in Q4 because of this shift. ","Turning to surgical technologies, revenue of $386 million grew 11%, with strong growth balanced across all three businesses. ENT grew in the high single-digits, with upgrades of the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system and NIM ENT nerve monitoring capital equipment driving growth.","In neurosurgery, robust sales of OR imaging systems in the U.S. contributed to a solid quarter of double-digit growth. Advanced energy grew over 20% again this quarter, as we continue to see strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedic, spine, breast, and CRDM replacement markets.","In neuromodulation, revenue of $478 million increased 7% on double digit global growth in DBS and PAINSTIM. In DBS, our successful referral development program in the United States and the strength of the early stim data in international markets, which show us DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease, is driving new impact growth.","Our PAINSTIM business grew double digits, both globally and in the U.S., driven by the ongoing launch of our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system. Our [gastro-uro] business had mid-single digit growth in Q3, as the business continues to face non-device competition. We are confident in the clinical benefits of InterStim therapy, and [unintelligible] to both implanters as well as referring primary care physicians.","In our diabetes business, revenue of $436 million grew 15%, a noticeable acceleration from prior quarters, driven by the U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530 G with Enlite CGM sensor. This is the first system in the U.S. that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas.","Multiple peer reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold Suspend feature, including studies that have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Every 530 G pump ships with Enlite sensors, which are smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate. In Q3, we estimate we gained over 400 basis points of pump share and NCGM share on a sequential basis in the U.S.","We were inventory challenged throughout the quarter, but these supply constraints are now resolved. During Q3, we recognized the majority of our deferred revenue, as we shipped systems to customers that had enrolled in our technology guarantee program. As of the end of Q3, we had $4 million of deferred revenue remaining from this program, which we expect to recognize in Q4. ","Turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q3 gross margin was 74.8%. After adjusting for a 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, the Q3 gross margin, on a non-GAAP operational basis, was 74.9%. ","It is also worth noting that the gross margin continues to include significant spending related to resources diverted to address quality issues in neuromodulation and diabetes, which negatively affected the gross margin by 30 basis points. For Q4, we expect the gross margin to be approximately 75% on an operational basis, and before a negative FX impact of 20 basis points. ","Third quarter R&D spending of $360 million was 8.6% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in Q4 to be closer to 8%, given our typical Q4 leverage as well as the continued shifting of R&D resources to enhance our quality systems, which gets recognized in cost of goods sold and also the tradeoff we are making to partially offset the U.S. medical device tax.","Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.454 billion represented 34.9% of sales, and included a 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. As expected, Q3 SG&A spending was modestly higher given the accelerated ramp of our U.S. CoreValve sales force ahead of U.S. approval, which occurred late in the quarter. ","We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses. In FY14, we would expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in a full year SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on an operational basis. ","Amortization expense for the quarter was $89 million. For Q4, we would expect amortization expense to be approximately $90 million, with the addition of the TYRX amortization, slightly offset by the elimination of our Ardian annualization. ","Net other expense for the quarter was $45 million, including net gains from our hedging program of $5 million. We hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Also included in net other expense is the impact from the U.S. medical device tax. Based on current exchange rates, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million. ","Net interest expense for the quarter was $25 million. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $13.7 billion in cash and investments, and $12.2 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million.","Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 20.2%. Excluding the impact of one-time items, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q3 was 19.6%. For FY14, we continue to expect a non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%. ","Our forecast does not assume the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired on December 31, would be extended before the middle of our fiscal year. Prior to expiring, the R&D tax credit provided a benefit of approximately $8 million per quarter. ","In Q3, we generated $1.5 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In Q3, we paid $279 million in dividends and repurchased $100 million of our common stock. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 66 million shares. ","Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.01 billion shares. For full FY14, we would expect to diluted weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 1.013 billion shares, including 1.011 billion shares in Q4. ","It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemptions, which was $239 million in Q3, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market, to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","Let me conclude by commenting on our FY14 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We believe a constant currency revenue growth rate of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for both the full fiscal year 2014 and for Q4. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact, if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday, for the remainder of the fiscal year, our FY14 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $170 million to $190 million, including a negative $35 million to $55 million impact in Q4.","Turning to guidance on the bottom line, at this point in the fiscal year, we are comfortable tightening our earnings per share guidance rage. We now expect FY14 earnings per share to be in the range of $3.81 to $3.83, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% on an operational basis after adjusting for certain tax benefits that we received in FY13, as well as the headwinds from the medical device tax and the incremental interest expense in FY14.","As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar.","Omar Ishrak ","Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by noting that over time we are striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations, which are consistent mid-single digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth of 200 to 400 basis points [unintelligible] revenue, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. ","Our three independent growth rate vectors, new therapies, emerging markets, and our new services and solutions, will provide the fuel for mid-single digit revenue growth. We believe that our continued effort to deliver consistent and reliable performance, combined with disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long term, dependable value in healthcare.","With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I\u2019ve asked Mike Coyle, president of our cardiac and vascular group, and Chris O\u2019Connell, president of our restorative therapies group, to join us again. We are rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow up. If you have additional questions, please contact our investor relations team after the call.","Operator, first question please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","Let me just focus on the cardiovascular side of the business, and I think probably two topics people would like to hear on are, one, how we should think about the cadence of the U.S. CoreValve launch, and if you could just maybe give us the metrics to get our heads around how quickly you can train centers. I know that some of that [was said already], but talk a little bit about the different centers in the U.S. and the expectations for training.","And the second topic would be on the drug [critical link] program. You made some encouraging comments relative to your expectations on the program and SFA. Could you just spend a little bit more time on that? What drives your confidence on the SFA side, given [what happened in below the knee], and your expectations for just the timing of that launch in the U.S.","Omar Ishrak ","I\u2019ll let Mike answer these. I think both of these are interesting topics, and we\u2019re making progress in both, but Mike, why don\u2019t you give some color?","Mike Coyle ","Sure, on the CoreValve ramp, I think it is pretty much just the way Rhonda Robb laid it out at the TCT meeting in terms of us basically ramping from the 60 centers that we currently have established a presence in. Roughly 20 to 30 centers a quarter for the next two quarters, and then probably adding at 40 per quarter after that. ","So that basically is the ramp rate we are going to pursue. Obviously, the key here is to have the very effective training of the sites, as we bring out the technology. It has performed excellently in clinical trials, and we want to make sure that performance continues as we ramp through the larger number of centers.","On the SFA side, we\u2019ve studied this application of the [unintelligible] product in multiple studies, and have had consistent results. And as you can imagine, we\u2019re now at a stage where the presentation of the data is coming at the Charing Cross meeting, which is in the first week of April, so we\u2019re very closely working with the centers who were involved in the study in preparing the data and are very confident that we\u2019re going to have a good presentation at Charing Cross.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","Can I just ask one quick follow up? The U.S. market, in aggregate, for procedure volumes, the expectation is that we saw some drop off in volumes in January, with not only the concerns that people had on the ACA going into the year, and then the [unintelligible] deductible, but also the weather we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. Can you just give us any commentary on how your U.S. business has looked November\/December versus January?","Omar Ishrak ","I think you make good point. We do see softness in January, when the volumes were a little slower. And this is on top of a soft January in the past year. In fact, we\u2019ve been discussing here that it looks like increasingly over time January appears to be under far greater pressure than November and December. We\u2019ve seen this pattern, realizing actually over multiple years, it was not that different.","You know, there could be many reasons. The introduction of the ACA, obviously we don\u2019t know the precise details of all the causes and effects. And certainly it brings a level of change that we haven\u2019t experienced before. So we\u2019re not really sure as to all the reasons, but we do know that January was a little softer than November and December, and in fact we\u2019ve seen this pattern over the past couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodd with Citigroup.","Matthew Dodd - Citigroup ","If you look at BRIC, it looks like only Brazil is really doing well. And I know there are some issues in Russia. Can you talk about maybe calendar \u201914, how you see BRIC kind of rolling out? Do you think it will improve? Is there any reason why it should for some of these other countries?","Omar Ishrak ","I think for us, especially as we look at central and eastern Europe in aggregate, and you\u2019re right, Russia is a dominant part of that, and China, are the two biggest pressure points that we\u2019ve had over the last year, both of those have been traditionally strong growth drivers and both of those have been under some pressure over the past several quarters. And that\u2019s really driven our performance to below 15% in the last few quarters, those two being the main drivers. ","We\u2019re seeing, actually, you can\u2019t see it for sure, but from the data that we\u2019ve seen so far, a bottoming out in both of those regions. China in particular appears to be stabilizing a little bit. And you know, it still grew at 12%, which is double digits, and we expect to improve on that as the quarters go by here in calendar \u201914. ","And Russia too, we went through a very unique circumstance where the budgets were not allocated in January as they usually are. They\u2019re now well in the process of allocating those budgets, and they\u2019re moving ahead with that, and we expect to see some progress there. And they\u2019re also changing the way in which they actually fund the budgets between the state and the central government. ","But in any case, they\u2019re beginning to release the money right now, so we expect that to bottom out as well. What it eventually settles to this calendar year is tough to say, but we do think that it will improve in the next few quarters. ","As far as Brazil and India go, they\u2019re smaller markets for us. The markets have a lot of room for growth. India, you know, we\u2019ve had some issues to do with the coronary business. We also feel it\u2019s stabilizing, although at a lower price than we\u2019ve had in previous years. Brazil seems to be running okay, and running quite well in fact as we go forward.","Any other comments Gary?","Gary Ellis ","No, I think you hit what we\u2019ve seen here recently, and as Omar said, we do expect it to continue to improve. And overall, we continue to expect that the emerging markets in general will get back up into that high teens growth as we go forward, to 20%. So each of the regions are laying out plans to achieve that, but we have seen a little bit of softness here in the last couple of quarters, but it does appear, basically just [unintelligible] data right now, but that seems to have bottomed. Still at double-digit growth, but it seems to have bottomed and then we\u2019re starting to see the growth come back to what we would expect in those markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","I was hoping you could come back a little bit more to the hospital solutions and broader contracting opportunity. Omar, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned a number like $350 million over seven years. And given the size of the business, that doesn\u2019t add that much on an annual basis. Could you maybe just go into a little bit more detail about, quantifiably, how you think we can start to see some of the benefits of the service or cross-selling model start to play out?","Omar Ishrak ","You know, that particular aspect of our services and solutions, which is the hospital solutions part, recall that we only started this program in September of last year. So we\u2019ve only had less than six months. And the traction that we\u2019re getting, and the momentum that we\u2019re building, is pretty good. We\u2019ve already got on the order of 10 accounts signed up, and a pipeline for another 10-15, and so we\u2019ve got a pretty solid pipeline driving this. So we expect this to become more and more important as we go forward.","The right way to think about it, though, is that this is revenue that\u2019s, although small compared to our overall business, is still contracted revenue, with known pricing, fixed pricing in the sense that there are rules around the pricing, but essentially fixed, and there\u2019s less uncertainty around it. With committed share as well. So the quality of the revenue here in this aspect of the business is actually quite good. And that\u2019s the way we look at it. In addition, the contracts also deliver some incremental revenue from not only share, but the services business.","And so that\u2019s the way we really think about it, that we\u2019re only in the beginning period of this activity, and we expect a larger and larger percentage of our European business to come from this aspect. And remember that we also have integrated care in Cardiocom. This is also delivering revenue that is incremental to what we normally see from our core technologies.","David Roman - Goldman Sachs ","And for my follow up, on the earnings line, looking to the midpoint of your guidance range, and what you\u2019ve done over the past couple of years, that would imply flattish earnings for the past three years. And understandably, you have the device tax in there and some other one-time items. But maybe just conceptually, Gary, you could talk about what changes as we go forward, whereby we could start to see more leverage on a reported basis. And is that something we can expect in FY15? ","Gary Ellis ","We\u2019re not obviously giving FY15 guidance about at this point in time. We\u2019ll do that as we complete our fourth quarter. The guidance for the current year has been consistent all year as far as where we were expecting to be at, and [tightening it] obviously in the quarter here, based on the fact that we only have one quarter yet to go. We had some headwinds as far as some of the tax benefits that we received in prior years, and so in general from that standpoint, there\u2019s some headwinds on the medical device tax and things that the entire industry has had to deal with in general. ","And plus, interest component, depending on how you were looking at this previously, whether you were looking at it on a GAAP basis or non-GAAP basis with interest and general, the fact is, we think we are increasing the earnings, the earnings per share. We are getting leverage from the standpoint of where the revenue growth was at, from an operational perspective. ","As we look into next year, we will provide guidance obviously at our fourth quarter earnings call, but in general, as we highlighted in our presentation, we do continue to expect, as Omar said in his comments, 200 to 400 basis points of leverage on the earnings per share line versus what we do on the revenue line. And we would expect that as we move ahead. I\u2019m not going to get into any more detail at this point, but that\u2019s just generally what you should expect as we move into next year. ","Omar Ishrak ","If I can add to that, from a strategy perspective, we\u2019re trying to get some degree of operational leverage through SG&A, which you\u2019ve seen us deliver quarter over quarter, whether [unintelligible] a little bit to R&D we delivered in the last several quarters and beyond. That, coupled with share buybacks, is the root of our earnings leverage strategy. Now, there are a whole bunch of other variables there, which kind of come and go here, to do with FX and tax and everything else. ","But those, to a large degree, are somewhat beyond our control, although we can work it the best we can. The things we can control on an operating basis, on a day-to-day basis that our business is really geared around, are the SG&A leverage, holding our gross margins flat, and then driving share buybacks to get additional earnings leverage. That\u2019s the basic recipe that we\u2019re trying to follow, and that will continue into the coming years. And our business is focused around working that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America ","First, I wanted to ask about the strength in the TAVI market outside the United States. Just wanted to get your views on what\u2019s driving that. Is this just an uptick in southern Europe? Just trying to get a sense for how much of this growth you think might be sustainable as we look forward.","Mike Coyle ","I think basically the strength of the data that was shown at PCC, I think, has really given a shot in the arm to the overall growth profile of the business. And we also have, obviously, a number of other small competitors who are coming in [unintelligible]. ","Those things combined, I think, are helping to accelerate the market. And we think there\u2019s plenty of headroom for more continued growth, as more data comes out on things like the high risk patients, and obviously as we continue to reenroll patients in the [unintelligible] risk patient population. ","In addition, we\u2019ve seen some favorable reimbursement moves, for example in France, and those things are helping us to see nice growth in the overall market. ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America ","Do you think it can be a sustained double digit market?","Mike Coyle ","I think we\u2019ve provided kind of five-year guidance of somewhere in the 12% to 14% range, so I think we\u2019re going to provide guidance for next year, I think when we have completed our planning activities, which are ongoing right now. ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America ","And then Omar, a question for you, from a bigger picture perspective. A couple of things. Just wanted to see if you could comment on a few areas of potential value creation for Medtronic longer term. Obviously in the specialty pharmaceutical area, we\u2019ve seen a lot of transactions that have created tremendous tax rate synergies for companies. And I was wondering if you could comment on the potential for tax rate synergies, transactions for medical technology. And then I was also wondering if you could comment on, is there any opportunity that you see over time for investors to realize some value creation from all your OUS cash? Just would love some overview comments on those two topics.","Omar Ishrak ","That\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s something we wrestle with quite a bit. It\u2019s true that a lot of our cash, in fact the majority of our cash, is being generated outside the U.S. And with the tax laws as they stand, we can\u2019t bring them back. ","Now, we\u2019ve got a number of strategies. Operationally, we\u2019re obviously trying to free up as much cash as we can in the U.S. through our inventory management programs and so on. And in the scheme of things, that\u2019s still a relatively small number. We have certain programs ongoing with the government in the U.S. to see if we can get some favorable tax rulings. That will probably help us in the short term if they come our way.","And then in terms of the OUS cash, there are possibilities that we know that some companies have employed. We do look at that. But you\u2019ve got to remember two things. First, we would never do something like that if it\u2019s not in line with our core strategy. We\u2019ve got certain market segments where we have defined that we will be in, which are cardiovascular, restorative therapy, which is potentially neuromusculoskeletal, if you like, and diabetes. ","We aren\u2019t going to go do some acquisition just for the sake of doing it, so that we can have a better tax bill. Now, if, within our defined inorganic growth strategy, we find that there\u2019s a fit that is in line with where we want to go, then we\u2019ll certainly look at that. So the main point I want to make here is that the strategy comes first, the tax consequences come second.","The other point I\u2019d like to make is that in that whole area there is a considerable degree of uncertainty regarding interpretation and what has been passed back, since it\u2019s not necessarily what future practice is going to be. So we just are very careful before we venture into that. Again, we\u2019re certainly looking at it very carefully, but there\u2019s not something that is an obvious solution to our OUS cash problem.","Gary Ellis ","You\u2019ve explained it well. Obviously the ultimate answer is that we need corporate tax reform in the U.S. to kind of address the issue and move on. But until that happens, we\u2019re putting other strategies, assuming that we\u2019ll still have the same issue. As Omar said, there are things that can be done, but for a company of Medtronic\u2019s size, they\u2019re relatively limited.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","Just on the CoreValve program, I was just wondering if you guys have submitted the clinical data in the PMA filings yet, for high risk?","Omar Ishrak ","Mike, have you submitted, on the CoreValve, the data for the PMA for the high risk?","Mike Coyle","Yes, we have submitted the data for the high risk. And those will be presented at the ACA meeting here at the end of March.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","","And then I guess just kind of bigger picture topic, you guys tightened the EPS range. I\u2019m just curious, why not tighten the revenue range for the full fiscal year? Maybe if you can just talk through some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter? I know you mentioned BMP has a particularly difficult comp, but just surprised why there isn\u2019t a little bit more confidence in revenue coming in at the higher end.","Gary Ellis ","The reality is the 3% to 4% that we\u2019ve been consistently saying all quarter, and for Q4, so we said 3% to 4% for the full year and 3% to 4% for the fourth quarter. And so that\u2019s consistent with where we\u2019ve been. We\u2019re at 3.7% or something like that at this point in time year to date, so I think we\u2019re still consistently in that range. And you have to remember, last year in our fourth quarter, we had a very, very strong fourth quarter, and so we have a tough comparison that, on the one hand, we\u2019re looking at here in Q4. ","So we think 3% to 4% is reasonable. Obviously we can exceed that. We always will, but based on what we\u2019ve done so far this year, where our markets are at, the 3% to 4% seems reasonable, both for the full fiscal year and for the fourth quarter. ","Omar Ishrak ","There\u2019s no implication here that there\u2019s something strange or anything like that. Other than the point that Gary made, that it\u2019s a little bit of a tough comp versus last year. Other than that, like we\u2019ve stated, it\u2019s within the guidance range that we\u2019ve been talking about, and we reiterated that although we\u2019re above the midpoint of that guidance range year to date, we\u2019re keeping the same for Q4.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","And then just Gary, to clarify, the diabetes deferred recognized in the quarter, was that about $23 million? Is that right?","Gary Ellis ","That\u2019s correct. We recognized about $23 million of it, and there\u2019s $4 million left to go.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","And then CoreValve, as that rolls out, are you guys going to do that on a consignment basis? Or will that be stocking? How should we think about that, because I believe your 3% to 4% total revenue growth had always excluded the launch of that product?","Gary Ellis ","We haven\u2019t discussed the [unintelligible] strategy for that launch. But any revenue is recognized on implant, so we\u2019re not planning on doing a big bulk launch. We\u2019ve actually been inventory constrained, so [unintelligible] right now would be based on implant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","Mike, just to kind of review comments made on the call, we read your comments on U.S. ICDs to reflect more inventory timing than share. Is that the right way to think about it? And can you give us your share outlook in the United States high power market over the next several quarters?","Mike Coyle ","The way I would characterize it is we really have to look at this over the two quarters, because of the volatility and what happens at the end of the quarters. So on a global basis, we think our share was relatively stable, if you look at that six-month kind of window. We saw share capture, I think, in international, where we basically have the full product set of offerings with the Evera product lines and the Viva XT product lines, including the [unintelligible], the Attain Performa product available in Europe and Japan. ","We\u2019re obviously still waiting for that product approval in the U.S., so we have seen a little bit of share loss in the U.S., but we would expect there are a number of obviously significant catalysts now that are coming into the market to help us on the share side, including the [adapta] CRT data, which basically is the first clinical feature to show reduced AF and reduced heart failure burden in patients who get LV-only CRT pacing. ","We also obviously will get the Performa product into the U.S. after the approval cycle has gone through. And as Omar mentioned, the TYRX product is a very exciting one for us in terms of its use in device implants. There\u2019s a 2% to 4% rate of infection, especially in replacements and in high risk patients, that we think we can make a meaningful impact on using these technologies. And that would obviously be added to our over product offerings.","So that, in addition to the lead integrity alert that we\u2019ve now gotten approval to use on not only our own, but on competitive product lines, we think is a very valuable feature that is going to help us move share in the market. So all these are new dynamics that we\u2019ll have for us going forward. ","","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","And then Omar, we talked to investors about your services strategy, which you talked a lot about on this call. There seems to be a sense that to win long term, you\u2019re going to need to go at risk to gain the share, to continue to execute the strategy the way that you like. Is going at risk, is that an accurate view? And if it\u2019s true, when\u2019s the earliest we could see at risk contracts in the U.S.?","Omar Ishrak ","You know, certainly our Cardiocom business has a services component that is already at risk. We charge on an appropriation basis, and in fact we are at risk with the certain hospital metrics, readmission metrics, with Cardiocom. So to some degree we\u2019ve already started that. ","I think the longer term at risk propositions will involve bigger pieces of value to do with our technology. I think the TYRX one is one that we will probably go after pretty quickly, because we have good data around its value in infection prevention, and we\u2019ve got other capabilities within the company that add to it, especially in replacing market in CRDM. And combined, there\u2019s a program that we could probably come up with that has a certain degree of risk associated with it.","You\u2019ve got to remember that when we say at risk, we are taking risk, usually, that we think that we have data for. So in our mind, it\u2019s really no risk, because we know these things work, through actual clinical data. ","Now, the system is such that there\u2019s no organized way in which credit is given for that improvement, and so that\u2019s why the best way to kind of [unintelligible] the system into giving credit for that improvement is by going at risk, saying look, we really believe in our data, and we\u2019re prepared to put some money down on it. We\u2019re not going to just take risk on an ad hoc basis on stuff that we don\u2019t have any data on.","So I think we have very targeted strategies that we\u2019re developing, and as I said, the Cardiocom and TYRX are probably the two first instances that you\u2019ve already seen and will begin to see come out in some level of scale in the next six to 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joann Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joann Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets ","If I heard you correctly, you talked about sort of a longer term goal of holding gross margin close to the 75% level. Can you talk about what things can be done to sort of expand that over time?","Omar Ishrak ","You know, our strategy has been that first of all holding it in this environment is quite a challenge, which you can appreciate, because there\u2019s a considerable amount of pricing pressure. And until we get to a value-based system, where people give us real value for the incremental features that we provide, today there\u2019s no mechanism for that, so we\u2019re in a negotiating arrangement, and so there\u2019s continual pressure on price.","So the two main ways in which we will, in this case, hold that gross margin, first, is a cost reduction program which we\u2019ve got in place, which we\u2019re using to offset most of that pricing pressure. And second is our means through which we will demonstrate that we\u2019ve got real value for the features that we have, and therefore get some extra pricing results from that.","If that second strategy is successful, and we\u2019re able to show the system a financial benefit for the incremental features that we\u2019re adding, we will get some degree of improvement in the long term. But our real strategy here is, we think that the 75% is a pretty good number, and any extra margin that we get, we would much rather [unintelligible] in volume, in a variety of different ways, by [unintelligible] our products and driving growth. That would be our strategy.","Joann Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets ","My second question is, there are a number of new CRM products which are coming out, some of which I know you\u2019re working on also, subcutaneous ICDs and leadless pacemakers. I\u2019d love your impression on how those products will be changing those markets.","Omar Ishrak ","You know, the one that we\u2019re most excited about is obviously the leadless pacemaker, and obviously I\u2019ll let Mike comment on it. And you know, the key about that product is that its insertion mechanism is much easier and it\u2019s much more targeted as a therapy. And we think that, from an overall procedure basis, this will lead to greater efficiency in the system and probably expand access, because especially outside the U.S., where a greater number of physicians can probably do the procedure, where there\u2019s an issue of the availability of such solutions.","So we see that as a fairly fundamental change in the way pacing will be done in the future over the long term. So we think that that\u2019s a big area of change, driven by technology. The other one you didn\u2019t mention, but we just launched the Linq product, which is also minimally invasive, and I mentioned in the commentary about the specific clinical areas where it will make a difference.","But in terms of diagnostics, the ease of use with which this thing can be implanted will make a significant difference to the workflow of cardiology and management of certain chronic diseases. So those are the areas where we think there will be the biggest changes. But Mike, can you give more color to that?","Mike Coyle ","I think you said it well. The ability with the leadless pacemaker to basically eliminate the [unintelligible], you know, pacing is a very safe invention, most of the complications are due to the creation of the pocket and the running of the leads. So the availability to be able to do a very quick procedure with a [unintelligible] delivery is, we think, very exciting. And especially as Omar mentioned, in emerging markets, there are just many more physicians with those skill sets. So the combination, we think, is very exciting for that market. ","And I think the Linq product, the ability to actually just do a subcutaneous placement of the device, with especially an injection of a device that\u2019s now 90% smaller than the Reveal product that it\u2019s replacing, really is a major advance technologically. But it\u2019s also coupled with some very impressive data we just released at the International Stroke Society on Friday, the CRYSTAL-AF study, that we showed that cryptogenic stroke patients, patients with unexplained prior strokes, who we know are at very high risks of repeat stroke, but it\u2019s difficult to determine how to treat them, that using standard care you\u2019re only going to find AF in 3% of those patients over three years.","If you use one of these Reveal devices, though, the Linq device, we\u2019ll be in a position to, as our data showed, identify 30% of those patients as ultimately having asymptomatic AF, who need therapy that they otherwise would not get, who would then have a second stroke. So these things, we think, are really fundamentally new opportunities for growth in that segment. ","Operator","Your final question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein ","Just to start with a couple of quick follow ups on CoreValve, do your sales this quarter reflect a full return to the German market? Or is there any further opportunity there? And then on your mid-FY15 timeline for high risk CoreValve approval, does that assume a full panel review by the FDA? And can you remind us why the FDA was able to bypass the panel review for the extreme risk data, and maybe the differences between extreme risk and high risk that might or might not lead the FDA to think about things differently?","Gary Ellis ","On the German market, as we mentioned last quarter, we were still working off of the loads that had been done during Q1 when we knew the injunction was imminent and customers were very much demanding our product. So, as we\u2019ve said, we expected that to normalize by the end of the third quarter. It pretty much has normalized by the end of the third quarter, so we would expect, going into the fourth quarter, we should be back at run rates to implants driving our overall revenue.","On the difference between the timing for the high risk data, obviously we continue to expect a mid-FY15 approval. That does assume a panel review. We didn\u2019t have the panel review for the extreme risk data because simply the data was so compelling that the FDA saw no reason to go back for a secondary review. ","There has been no determination from the FDA on whether or not a panel would be required for the high risk data, and obviously it all depends on the quality of the data. We will be showing those data at the ACC meeting in a late breaking clinical trial session, and then we\u2019ll be working with the FDA to schedule approval of the product. ","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein ","And just a quick follow up on drug eluting stents. I think your sales there have been holding up a lot better than we and most investors have been expecting. How much of that is bundling with CoreValve? And looking forward, how much opportunity do you have to try further stent sales through any bundling with CoreValve now that you\u2019re on the market there? ","Omar Ishrak ","I\u2019ll let Mike comment on the bundling, but I\u2019ll say that from what I know, the success of the product itself, the Resolute Integrity and its feature set, is also getting some level of traction. So you know, you\u2019ve got to give that a little bit of credit. But I think on top of that, our [CVG] strategy has clearly demonstrated the success with the drug eluting stent. Maybe Mike, I\u2019m sure you can add some color.","Mike Coyle ","Obviously the CoreValve approval for the extreme risk came very late in the last week, so it really had no impact in terms of any kind of bundling activities with our OR [DES] product. We did gain about a point and a half of global share year over year with Resolute Integrity, which is very impressive given that it\u2019s been out seven, eight quarters into the market now. ","First, it\u2019s a great product, and the deliverability of the product has really been very well received by the physician community. The labeling they have for diabetes, its performance in bifurcation, we continue to supplement the data set at every major meeting, and basically that factor is probably the single most important factor in driving the overall share growth. ","But I would also say that, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we have somewhere north of 12% of our total, for example, U.S. CVG revenue in multi product line bundles for CVG, and the Resolute Integrity product is in 98% of those [unintelligible], so it is probably the one that benefits more than any from that overall strategy. So it\u2019s just a great product, and it\u2019s being presented to the marketplace in the right way. And as we get these new catalysts, like the CoreValve, into the market, we expect the power of that story should only increase. ","Omar Ishrak ","I think actually Mike makes a great point, that the bundling strategies, and all of the strategies that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of services solutions, rest on our ability to have market leading technologies in each area. Without that, the other strategies do not work. And so we\u2019ve got to make sure that we have market-leading strategies in our core areas. That, coupled with our breadth and scale, provides us with truly differentiated positioning in the marketplace. ","So with that, let me conclude the session here. But I\u2019d like to remind you, before concluding, that we do plan to host our initial institutional investor and analyst meeting on June 5 in New York City. And with that, on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our continued progress in our Q4 call, which we anticipate holding on May 20. Thank you.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our first quarter which ended on July 27, 2018. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During this earnings call, many of the statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. References to quarterly results increasing, decreasing or staying flat are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 and references to organic revenue growth exclude the impact of material acquisitions, divestitures and currencies, references to pro forma exclude the impact of material divestitures. Unless we say otherwise, quarterly growth rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for material divestitures as well as the impact of foreign currencies. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. I am pleased to announce that this morning we reported strong first quarter results. Revenue grew 6.8% on an organic basis marking the third straight quarter of 6.5% or better organic revenue growth, with strong growth across all four groups and regions. Operating profit grew 7% and non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 13.6% pro forma and 8.7% adjusted for currency. We are executing against our strategies. We are growing our markets and driving share gains across multiple businesses and multiple geographies. Businesses that were challenged 12 months ago are now headed in the right direction as evidenced for the past three quarters. We continue to execute in emerging markets and with our differentiated programs that deliver improved economic value to payers and providers. Our execution is not only in the top line, but also down the P&L. We delivered margin expansion for our Enterprise Excellence program, whether increasing our investment in R&D to fuel future growth.","Looking at our group results in the first quarter, each of our operating groups delivered strong results, with over 6.5% growth in RTG, mid single-digit growth in CVG and MITG, and mid-20s growth in diabetes. Our Cardiac and Vascular Group grew 5% led by 10.9% growth in Coronary and Structural Heart. CSH, a strong high-teens growth in transcatheter valves driven by sustained global demand for our Evolut PRO valve. CSH also continued to see very strong adoption of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent, including low 30s growth in the U.S. In cardiac rhythm and heart failure, we had robust growth in Infection Control, AF Solutions and our Mechanical Circulatory Support businesses. In addition, our pacemaker business had mid single-digit growth, driven by the continued rollout of our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System and the Azure next generation family of pacemakers.","In our Aortic, Peripheral & Venous division, our endoVenous business grew in the mid-teens driven by growth of our VenaSeal closure system. Across CVG, we are seeing great success of multiple new value based business models that directly link our therapies improving outcomes. We now have nearly 1,700 active customers participating with associated revenue from these programs representing an increasing percentage of our U.S. CVG revenue. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 4.9% led by 5.8% growth in surgical innovations as we capitalize on the conversion of surgical procedures from open to minimally invasive driven by new products. In Advanced Energy strong adoption of our recently launched enhancements of the LigaSure vessel sealing instrument resulted in low double-digit growth. In Advanced Stapling, we grew in the mid single-digits driven by sales of our innovative Signia powered surgical stapling system and our Tri-Staple 2.0 reloads.","Our Restorative Therapies Group posted the best quarterly performance in its history growing 6.8%, led by mid-teens growth in our brain and pain divisions. In Brain Therapies both neurovascular and neurosurgery grew in the high teens. With the adoption of our endovascular stroke treatments, driving growth in neurovascular and the strength of our imaging, navigation, robotic and ablation systems driving growth in neurosurgery. In pain therapies, our spinal cord stim business growth accelerated to the low-20s this quarter, including high-20s growth in the U.S. driven by customer preference for our new offerings including the Intellis stimulator, Evolve workflow algorithm and our Snapshot reporting. We also had low-teens growth in Targeted Drug Delivery as we have delivered the best quarter of SynchroMed II sales growth in over 6 years.","In Spine, while growth was flat this quarter, when our spine revenue is combined with our sales of spine enabling technologies that are reported in our neurosurgery business, our overall revenue grew 4%. We believe this is a more relevant comparison of our spine results against our competition and an indication that our surgical synergy strategy is working driving above market growth. Our Diabetes Group had its best quarterly performance in more than a decade with 26.3% growth driven by sustained strong demand for our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. We now have over 97,000 trained active users of our 670G system. Outside of the U.S. our Diabetes Group grew in the high-teens, driven by sales of the MiniMed 640G and we are now just beginning to commercialize the 670G in international markets. Our strong global results led to over six points of share gain this quarter in pumps.","In standalone CGM, the U.S. launch of our Guardian Connect product is off to a solid start, taking share in the $1 billion standalone CGM market. With the Sugar.IQ assistant, Guardian Connect is the only Smart CGM using the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to give personalized insights and predictive alerts. The higher CGM sensor attachment and utilization that we are seeing with integrated pump users combined with the sensors that are used with Guardian Connect are not only driving strong CGM sales growth which was nearly 50% this quarter, but also creating a consistent long-term annuity stream for our Diabetes Group.","Turning to geographic revenue growth, we are continuing to execute well in emerging markets which grew 11% and represented 15% of our revenue this quarter. Several markets drove our performance reflecting broad diversification, China grew 12%, the Middle East and Africa grew 16%, Southeast Asia grew 14%, Eastern Europe grew 10% and South Asia grew 11%. Our differentiated strategies of public and private partnerships and optimizing the distribution channel are making a difference in emerging markets around the world.","Today, Medtronic has leadership positions in almost all of the fastest growing markets in med tech and as a management team we are intentionally allocating our capital to higher growth markets and new opportunities. We have seen the early benefits of our top line performance in the last three quarters with the bigger picture, which we outlined at our June Investor Day is that we are increasing our RAMware, our weighted average market growth rate by shifting our mix of businesses to faster growing therapies and geographies. As we invest in these opportunities our goal is not just to continuously innovate, but also invent and disrupt and our intention is to lead in all three areas. This is reflected by technology pipeline which we detailed in our Investor Day to mention just a few of the highlights. In CVG, we are investing in Micra AV, which will allow us to access over half of the pacemaker markets with our disruptive transcatheter pacing systems. During Q1, we had first-in-human implants of our extravascular ICD system. We are also funding clinical programs to bring therapies to market in transcatheter mitral valve replacement and renal denervation for hypertension. Both of which has the potential to be multibillion dollar markets. In MITG, we remain on track with our robotic-assisted surgery platform as we have discussed at Investor Day. In RTG, we are investing in next-generation premium mounted and closed-loop DBS systems. In diabetes, we are developing a destructive closed loop ecosystem with advances in pump therapy, CGM and informatics to drive dramatic improvements for people to manage their condition more easily. I could go on with dozens of additional programs in every one of our groups, but suffice to say, we are executing on the strongest pipeline in Medtronic\u2019s nearly 70-year history.","In addition to driving our top line growth, we are also executing in our Enterprise Excellence program as evidenced by margin expansion this quarter. As a reminder, this program is still just in its early stages and is expected to drive sustained cost savings, while also allowing for greater reinvestment in R&D over the next several years. We are working to leverage our breadth in many areas from global manufacturing and technology sharing to our clinical and regulatory expertise, shared services and global distribution. As I mentioned at the start, the message overall is that we are executing. We are allocating our capital across our business and focusing incremental resources on our biggest growth opportunities. In the process, we are driving our RAMware upwards to the right, while at the same time driving operating leverage and margin expansion.","Finally and importantly, we are putting the processes in place to improve our free cash flow conversion, which will create additional capital that can be returned to shareholders and reinvested to drive future growth, all with the goal of creating long-term shareholder value.","With that, let me ask Karen now to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue of $7.384 billion represented organic growth of 6.8%. Foreign currency had a positive $78 million impact on first quarter revenue. Non-GAAP earnings per share, was $1.17. And after adjusting for the divestiture, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 13.6% pro forma and 8.7% constant currency. While we came in $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance range, it\u2019s worth noting that $0.03 was driven by stronger than expected FX tailwinds and $0.01 was upside from tax. Given this, we would characterize $0.02 as operational outperformance reflecting better-than-expected revenue in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.3%, increasing 80 basis points pro forma and reflecting a slight improvement on a constant currency basis in line with our outlook.","We are expanding margins and at the same time investing more in research and development to enhance our pipeline resulting in first quarter R&D expense growing 100 basis points faster than revenue as we focus on driving long-term value. Non-GAAP SG&A as a percent of sales this quarter declined by 90 basis points pro forma and 70 basis points constant currency, early evidence that we are executing on our companywide Enterprise Excellence program. Net other operating expense, which is included in our operating margins, was $60 million compared to $42 million pro forma in the prior year, with the increase primarily due to the year-over-year change in currency gains and losses related to our hedging program. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 13.3%, better than expected given favorable tax resolutions and expirations. For the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our tax rate to be 15% plus or minus modestly higher than our previous expectations.","First quarter free cash flow was a robust $1.4 billion. Improving our cash generation is a priority at Medtronic from the top of the company on down. We can vary from quarter-to-quarter given timing of payment, so we don\u2019t want you to extrapolate our first quarter results for the full year. That said, we are pleased with our performance over the last two quarters and are beginning to see the benefit of our increased focus and discipline around cash flow. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing reinvestment with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders.","We increased our dividend by 9% in June making it our 41st consecutive year delivering a dividend increase. And we repurchased a net $374 million of our ordinary shares in the first quarter. Our total shareholder payout ratio was 66% on non-GAAP net income and 98% on GAAP net income. And the increased investment in organic R&D that I mentioned earlier is an example of our reinvestment focus to increase our return on invested capital and create long-term shareholder value.","Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to update our annual revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the full fiscal year, we are increasing our organic revenue growth guidance from a range of 4% to 4.5% to a range of 4.5% to 5%. And I will go a step further in saying we are comfortable with the higher end of this upwardly revised range. For the year, we now expect CVG, MITG and RTG to grow 4% to 4.5% versus our prior expectation of 4% plus or minus. We expect diabetes to grow in the low to mid-teens, up from low double-digits previously with a stronger first half versus second half based on prior year comparisons. It\u2019s worth noting that while we have had three straight quarters of 6% to 7% revenue growth, we don\u2019t expect to grow 6% to 7% every quarter. Some of our businesses faced tougher comparisons particularly in the back half of the year and others are in more challenging markets. Our guidance takes all of that into account along with the diversification of our end markets, strength of Medtronic.","Turning to margins, we continue to expect operating margin expansion in the full fiscal year of approximately 50 basis points on a pro forma constant currency basis, driven by our Enterprise Excellence initiatives. And with respect to earnings, we are increasing our fiscal year \u201819 implied constant currency EPS growth forecast from a range of 8% to 9% to a range of 9% to 10% on the heels of our strong quarter. However, recent rates foreign exchange looks to be neutral to full year EPS versus a $0.05 benefit prior. So despite the increase in our constant currency EPS forecast, given the recent currency volatility, the ongoing discussions around trade tariffs and the fact that it is still early in our fiscal year, we have elected to leave our non-GAAP EPS guidance unchanged in the range of $5.10 to $5.15.","While the impact from currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, our full year revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $420 million to $520 million. Despite the incremental headwinds on the top line, given the benefit of our hedging programs, FX is still a slight positive to fiscal \u201819 operating margins and neutral to earnings and free cash flow. For the second quarter in particular, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6%. We expect CVG to grow approximately 4%, RTG and MITG to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% and diabetes to grow 20% plus or minus. And given the impact of the hurricane and infusion set recall in the prior second quarter, we expect our operating margin improvement this upcoming quarter to be a little more than the full year.","We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.13 to $1.15. This guidance reflects solid revenue growth and margin expansion offset by a higher tax rate and an FX headwind of $0.02 at recent rates which is $0.03 unfavorable to what we had expected at the time of our last earnings call. And if recent rates hold, revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $100 million to $150 million, operating margin would have a slight benefit and EPS without have $0.02 headwind as previously mentioned.","Finally, on free cash flow, we continue to expect to generate between $4.7 billion and $5.1 billion in fiscal year \u201819. And as we mentioned at our Investor Day, over the next couple of years, we expect to make significant progress in improving our conversion of earnings into free cash flow as litigation and tax payments are expected to diminish based on what we know today and we benefit from programs we have put in place to improve working capital. The past couple of quarters are a great start towards delivering on this goal.","Now, I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen. Before we go to Q&A, I want to thank our more than 86,000 employees for their tireless work ethic and relentless execution once again this quarter. This was another strong quarter for Medtronic not just in terms of the headline numbers of organic growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation, but as importantly, we are executing in our strategies and positioning the company to create long-term shareholder value. One, our pipeline has never been stronger. As I outlined in June, everything at Medtronic starts with technology. We are innovating, we are inventing and we are disruptive. With the advancements in our pipeline in the last few months, I have never been more excited about our end-markets, our opportunities and our competitive position. Second, we are allocating capital efficiency across our business. Third, we are leading the development of emerging markets for our therapies and we are capitalizing on our leadership and value-based healthcare to our investments in the higher growth markets and higher growth geographies, we are shifting our RAMware upwards and to the right.","Lastly, we are consistently improving our free cash generation and we are in the early stages of implementing our multiyear Enterprise Excellence program, which should enable us to drive multi-year margin and reinvestment for long-term growth. We know there is much work to be done, but I am excited about our progress in our positioning.","With that, let\u2019s now open the phone calls up for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bob White, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel.","Rick Wise","Good morning, Omar. Good morning, everybody. Congrats on the excellent quarter for sure, but I want to focus if I could first on the sales outlook. I appreciate it\u2019s early in the year, Karen, you certainly helped us understand that and then you want to stay conservative. But \u2013 and you have just got us to 5.5% to 6% for the second quarter. If I focus on the second quarter, help me understand to be as I think about the second quarter very similar to the fiscal first quarter in terms of comparisons, I mean, the tremendous pipeline performance, ongoing cost reductions etcetera. Maybe if you could give us a little more color on why the fiscal second quarter wouldn\u2019t be even better than that guidance 5.5%, especially given the relatively easy comps, the hurricane impacted year ago numbers. Is it something maybe we need to understand better about some of the headwinds out there that keep you more in the 5.5% to 6% range?","Omar Ishrak","Let me take that. First, thanks for the questions. And first thing that I want to mention is that overall, we feel very good about this business. Our momentum is strong. Our end-markets are good and we are in the right end markets and that\u2019s why we increased our FY \u201819 overall revenue growth assumptions. And we are really confident in our ability to deliver this strong growth profile of the year. That said, it still is very early in the year. We are focused on setting guidance that we have a high degree of confidence and if we can deliver, I think that\u2019s important to note. I think, but overall this business is performing, there is no real major concerns from a business perspective. We are in fact excited about our pipeline and excited about our execution across the board. And so we look forward to a business that can consistently deliver and we have a great deal of confidence that we can in fact do that.","Karen Parkhill","And I would just add, Rick, that on the second quarter in particular we did say that we expect 5.5% to 6% organic growth in the second quarter, which is higher than the other quarters given the comparison. Keep in mind we do have the anniversary of some major product launches particularly in CVG and Resolute Onyx and Evolut PRO. We also have some pricing pressures in certain geographies this fiscal year, most notably Japan and Australia and all of that is baked into our guidance.","Rick Wise","Great. And just a follow-up on diabetes, another outstanding quarter here best in a decade as you say, again I assume this was as you mentioned 670G driven, but you launched the standalone sensor in mid-June, do we expect this growth to simply continue with these kind of levels given this kind of performance, but if I \u2013 when I reflect on it seems still early in the launch of the Guardian sensor, you highlighted the OUS rollout, why wouldn\u2019t growth actually accelerate from here in Diabetes and maybe just give us a little color on how widely available the Guardian sensor is at this point?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. Let me take that again. First of all, we are excited about diabetes and we are excited about a market that we are leading and created. And this market is going to go through a tremendous amount of change and we expect to be right in the leadership position in that. The Guardian sensor is launched extremely well the Guardian Connect and have to add that we are really \u2013 our sensor is differentiated by the addition of Sugar.IQ which is a cognitive decision support system that provides insights to patients. But having said that our position in the hybrid closed loop is something that\u2019s really setting the standards as to how patients with type 1 diabetes in particular can manage themselves. And really in the beginning of that journey and we expect that this product will continue to innovate over time and we will be leading that innovation sort of the roadmap. Now having said that, we are coming up against some pretty difficult comparisons because if you recall we went through a period last year at this time where we had a shortage in our sensors, we overcame that according to our plans. And so although we expect diabetes to maintain like we said mid-teens growth profile for the year. The present rate is really advantage for the comparisons that we have had over last year, but expect an exciting double digit growth business certainly for this year and over the long-term a business that will set the standards for growth of Medtronic and that\u2019s what we expect from it.","Rick Wise","Thanks Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Rick. Next question, Lori.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Well, great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about emerging markets, obviously it\u2019s been a source of tremendous growth for the company and just over the course of the last three months to four months, it\u2019s been a period sort of extraordinary volatility in certain emerging markets, so Omar I was wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind just kind of commenting on emerging market trends in the quarter and the sustainability of those trends as we look forward given all that\u2019s going on? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Bob. First of all, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Emerging markets has been stable and strong deliverer of growth for us over the years and something that will be sustained. And I do think here too we set a leadership profile in the med tech industry as to how to approach these emerging markets by going direct to our customers by helping these markets develop their own healthcare systems. As you know the need in these emerging markets is tremendous. You just need to look at the amount of penetration that our technologies have in these markets even the most people who can afford these therapies. And so that need is always going to be there. And despite economic sort of uncertainties and economic variations that will happen, it is an area where there is the continued need and that need doesn\u2019t go away. Peoples fall ill irrespective of economic conditions, so there is certain degree of base stability in these markets that we depend on and that we have seen happen. In addition to that, what we have in a differentiated way compared to other med tech companies is that we have got a very diversified profile within emerging markets where China is clearly our biggest market where we have consistently delivered. But in addition, we have got strong positions in the Middle East and Africa and Latin America and Eastern Europe and also in Southeast Asia. So, putting all that together, the inherent stability of these markets because of the disease needs in this market and the amount of penetration that\u2019s required for our therapies amongst people who can afford it given the fact that we are diversified across these geographies, given the fact that we are leading the way in creating these markets and working with both public and private partners gives me a great deal of comfort that the baseline that we have established of double-digit growth in the emerging markets will continue in the foreseeable future and I have got complete confidence on that and really excited about what we can do there.","Bob Hopkins","Terrific. I appreciate the detail and clarity. One follow-up for Karen, congrats on the outperformance on the margin side, just want to dig a little bit deeper though on the margin performance in the quarter, it looks like on an operating margin basis, excluding the impact of currency, operating margins were roughly flat year-over-year on an underlying basis. It looks like you took the opportunity to spend more in R&D given the strength in the overall business. I was wondering if kind of that\u2019s the right read or were there other sort of moving pieces in the quarter that impacted underlying operating margins? Thank you.","Karen Parkhill","You have the right read. Thank you for the question. We did increase our investment in R&D in the quarter, particularly in CVG and diabetes. In CVG, we had ahead of plan enrollment in some key clinical trials, including RDN and mitral. In diabetes, we purposely accelerated our focus on driving an advanced hybrid closed loop system. And in fact, our R&D investment by our calculations was 30 bps higher than Street consensus. We did also absorb a mix impact on our gross margin, which I talked about where we saw some revenue strength from some lower margin businesses that did impact our gross margin and we drove strong SG&A improvement that more than offset it. So we still did have a slight improvement in our overall operating margin, which we were pleased and was in line with our original outlook.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Bob. Next question, Lorie?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just a couple of questions. Karen, just I want to start with you on the organic growth outlook and I noticed some questions on the second quarter, but if you think about this year, I mean, your guidance sort of implies 6% performance in the first half and maybe 4% performance in the second half. So, I wanted to focus more on the second half, if your first half guidance is sort of correct, you still need to see some momentum acceleration in the business in the back half of the year to deliver sort of that 4% type number? Can you just sort of talk about some of the drivers of how you get that momentum acceleration in the back half just given the very material difference in sort of first half versus second half comparables?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, thanks for the question, David. Appreciate it. In the second half, as Omar mentioned first and foremost, we are really pleased with the performance of our business, the strength of our underlying end-market, the momentum that we have, we do expect that momentum to continue throughout the year. We have increased our overall revenue growth guidance for the year as a result of that. Keep in mind, as we have talked about in the back half, we do come across some tougher comparisons from the prior year. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have the anniversary of some key product launches that impact us even more in the back half and we have got some pricing pressures from certain geographies that I noted Japan and Australia, but we are very excited about the continued momentum underlying. It\u2019s really just the comparison in the back half.","David Lewis","Okay. And just to follow-up Karen on free cash, we appreciate that conversion this quarter was obviously materially higher than what you had suggested it would be by this point, but I know we are not going to make this a trend, but how should free cash trend, what are some of the factors that would sort of erode the relative run-rate of free cash across the year? And then kind of related to that, could just update us on the Puerto Rico tax settlement, there were some new dynamics that played out late last week and maybe just remind us the path forward on Puerto Rico and any impact on tax rate or payment scenarios? Thanks so much.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, thank you David. We were really pleased with our performance on free cash flow in the quarter. This is the focus as we have talked about from the top of the company on down to drive free cash flow improvement and we have been able to do that in the last two quarters, the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year. In terms of trend, keep in mind that free cash flow can be lumpy and it does depend on the timing of larger cash payments, particularly in tax and legal. So I certainly would want you to extrapolate this first quarter for the rest of the year, but we are focused on delivering free cash in our full year guidance of $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion. We are confident in our ability to do that. We have been focused on working capital improvement in this quarter did drive improvement in both accounts receivable and accounts payable in particular. And so we are confident in our ability to deliver on this free cash flow and improve the earnings conversion. In terms of Puerto Rico and the settlement last week, we did have the appellate court rule basically remanding the case back to the lower court for additional fact finding. I would say it\u2019s really important to note that this was merely a procedural decision. It is not a ruling based on the merit. The appellate court determined that it needed additional analysis from the tax court in order to rule on the merits. So we still believe our initially filed tax returns were correct and we will continue to defend our position. In terms of what that means on the impact on cash flow given that the case has been remanded back to the lower courts and it will take some time. We don\u2019t expect at this stage any additional tax payments related to this case this fiscal year.","Omar Ishrak","David, let me also just add a little color to the question on the growth profile, look there are some quarterly dynamics which Karen went through and we are setting guidance that we have confidence in delivering. But let me tell you our pipeline has never been stronger and in the next 12 months or so I am really excited about what we can do in our pain business, our Intellis and Evolve workflow is really hitting the mark here and our strong turnarounds which we expect to continue. Our Micra which I have talked about a lot before is the disruptive technology, we are the only player in this space. It\u2019s the market which we are disrupting we created and now we are disrupting ourselves. It currently addresses only 20% of the single-chamber market and we have got the roadmap to make this 100%. The core valve Evolut R is another one that is building on the success of the original launch of the platform and finally the Guardian Connect in the 670G like I mentioned earlier are highly differentiated. So I just want to lay that out that these are not like promises for the future, these are right now. And we are extremely excited about these technologies and we expect sustained growth and leadership positions in all of these areas. I had to make that point David.","David Lewis","Thanks Omar for clarity on the second half. Thanks Karen as well.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks David. Take the next question please Lori.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robbie Marcus","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the good quarter. Karen, maybe just a follow-up on free cash flow, we all saw that the performance this quarter, we know it\u2019s now part of the compensation for management, so clearly a priority, can you kind of run us through some of the changes strategically and operationally the company is making to improve free cash flow over the long-term?","Karen Parkhill","Sure Robbie. Thank you for the question. We talk about it being a focus from the top of the company on down. It is a clear focus in all of our monthly financial reviews. It\u2019s the clear focus in our quarterly business review. Honestly, when we had our recent officers meeting, we have spent the entire day talking about how we could improve free cash flow. So there is a very strong focus and as you already noted it\u2019s an important part of our compensation, it will represent about a third of our compensation, our annual incentive compensation.","Omar Ishrak","I think in addition maybe I can add a few things more. We are creating systems, sort of IT systems through which we can track free cash flow better, rolling it down across our businesses to a pretty granular level. We are creating systems to reach our forecasting processes is using the latest tools in IT NAI for that matter. And so I think this is an area of continued focus for us and continued upgrade of our capabilities. And it\u2019s something that we do \u2013 are confident to deliver and improve over the next few years.","Robbie Marcus","Okay, great. And as a follow-up maybe a two for robot question, saw very strong performance in the brain therapies division you called out the Mazor X robot is one of the drivers and maybe you can give us some early insights to that and then at the same time it\u2019s been a few months since the Analyst Day, any update on the robot in surgery, anything can add in terms of functionality or timing or viewpoint on it? Thanks a lot.","Omar Ishrak","Let me just give a short overview and then I will let both Bob and Geoff comment in their specific robots. But let me tell you this, the integration of capital equipment in this case, the robot with implants and our sort of high value consumables is a unique competence that we are delivering and it\u2019s something that would set us apart and use our scale to really create these markets in a new and differentiated way that will set us completely apart from competition. So, it\u2019s an area that we are really focused on and really excited about the progress that we are seeing, but more importantly, excited about the future. So with that, I will let Bob go first and then Geoff.","Bob White","Sure. Thanks, Robbie. This is Bob. We are excited about where we are at with the surgical robot. We remain absolutely on track with what we talked about during Investor Day. We continue to get really good surgeon feedback. In fact, we have got additional surgeons in this week who are providing us feedback on the system. So, our program remains on track. We continue to get good feedback. And importantly, again with the spiral design process, we are doing it in delivering the system that based on the input and the features that our surgeons want most. So, I think we are well-positioned to deliver what we said we are going to do.","Geoff Martha","Yes, Robbie, it\u2019s Geoff. For sure, the capital equipment within our brain business is one of the two big drivers of that in neurovascular, but it\u2019s more than \u2013 it\u2019s much more than Mucorex. For us, it\u2019s a suite of enabling technology, the navigation, the inter-operative imaging, which is our O-Arm, the Mucorex, the Arm, the robotic arm and our Midas Rex powered instruments. And one other key competencies that in addition to what Omar said is that we are doing and integrating these tools, so that for the surgeon workflow and delivering it. And so that what the robotic tailwind has done is increased \u2013 it\u2019s gotten surgeon interest in robots, but now that\u2019s driving for us is increased interest in navigation. Folks that weren\u2019t looking at navigation before are now looking at it and it\u2019s been a tailwind for all of our enabling technology and quite frankly the more revenues coming from the O-Arm and navigation in Midas Rex and the whole integrated suite. And so we are excited about that for that reason alone, but in addition, look at that as a leading indicator for our spine business as our implant business, as this technology comes more proliferated and you are going to see that helping our implant business as well. So, again, it\u2019s more than the robot when it comes to spine. It\u2019s all of these other enabling technologies that are integrated together.","Robbie Marcus","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Robbie. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glenn Novarro of RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning guys. Two questions. First, for Omar, another good quarter with free cash flow, but the company has been very quiet on the M&A front here recently, is this more a function of the targets, the valuations for some of the targets, the discussions that you are having, the valuations are too rich. So maybe talk a little bit about the pipeline and why we haven\u2019t seen much on the M&A front lately? And then I have a follow-up.","Omar Ishrak","Sure. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Glenn for the question. First of all, M&A remains important to us and we have got a strong balance sheet and we expect to use it as we generate, our free cash flow profile improves, we are in a stronger and stronger position to execute on that. Let me also tell you a few other things though. First of all, let\u2019s not take our eye off our performance in organic growth and that\u2019s the highest return investments that we can make and we can do it. Now, M&A supplements that and our focus in M&A has been tuck-in acquisitions, so it will remain to be tuck-in acquisitions and then lot of activity in that area. We continue to monitor the space. When the right opportunity comes along we will act. We are very active there and that will complement what we are doing organically. It\u2019s also important to note that like I said earlier tuck-in acquisitions are the major focus and because that\u2019s where our size and scale can immediately complement any other company out there without benefit of that size and scale. So, that is our focus and we are in a strong position to execute on that and you will see activity from us, but we will do it in a disciplined fashion like I have said earlier protecting our margin profile, moving up into the right November and making sure that we have both the financial and the management bandwidth to execute. So these are things that we have said before and things that we continued to do and certainly our eyes are wide open as to what\u2019s available out there. And we expect to be a strong player in this space.","Glenn Novarro","Alright. And then you had very strong numbers out of surgical innovations up mid single-digits, is this a signal that surgical volumes accelerated in the second quarter or is this more a function of market share capture? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","First of all the overall healthcare market is pretty stable, I am not sure that there was any significant inflection point in the growth of procedures or anything like that, it\u2019s more or less stable both in the U.S. and in other developed markets around the world. I think our technology innovation continues and that helps us drive this growth profile. In surgical innovations, we have a stream of technologies that come out all the time. And as you have noticed our momentum has been pretty consistent. And I do think that our technology leadership has played a role there. I do want \u2013 I will ask Bob to also make a few comments on this because he is really closer to it\u2026","Bob White","Yes. Thanks Omar and thanks Glenn. And you are right we had an excellent quarter inside of MITG seeing really good growth from advanced MIS as well as stapling. So we are really pleased by our new product performance. We have not seen significant change in the procedural volumes in the U.S. market, particularly in the high acuity space where we participated seeing that stable procedure growth. But it\u2019s important to note I think as Omar alluded to, it\u2019s really our product innovation is far more impactful to driving our results in the underlying procedure trends. So we are pleased with where we are at and we are really pleased about the pipeline that we continue to see across our businesses here in MITG.","Omar Ishrak","Let me just add a few more to that. I have spent a lot of time now with the surgical innovation group understanding the technology and what they are doing. I can tell you I am very impressed by the nature of this technology, this sophisticated closed loop little system that go on, that gives feedback to the surgeons and there is a lot of room for innovation in these end effectors and one that we will continue to invest in and lead in over time.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, thank you. Thank you for answering the question.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Glenn. Next question please Lori.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Josh Jennings","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong results here in fiscal Q1. I was hoping to start off maybe for Omar and possibly Geoff, just to get updated thoughts on how you see your orthopedic efforts proceedings, do you feel the need or desire to get bigger in orthopedics over time and just any update on the progress you are making with your current offerings in knee and whether you have hip approval yet and whether or not there is any opportunity with the ultimate transition of \u2013 to my procedures and to the outpatient setting?","Omar Ishrak","I will let Geoff comment on that in a minute, but let me just say that our portfolio right now is strong and robust. And we have got diversified positions in high growth market segments and that\u2019s our priority to maintain that, to continue to grow that and add to that in terms of tuck-in acquisitions. The orthopedic space is an adjacent space and there are some areas where we can add value and we have done some early work in that area. And I am going to ask Geoff to kind of comment on it, but let\u2019s not take our eye off our main goal which is our core markets where we intend to like I have said several times intend to set the standards and technology and keep driving those markets up. So Geoff, do you want to say a few words about orthopedic\u2026","Geoff Martha","First, it\u2019s the Micra comment, do we feel a need to run orthopedics, I would say no. It\u2019s not a need. If there is an opportunity for us to be a disruptive and scale the business in a disruptive way then we think we can do that and they will move more aggressively. So we are evaluating that and looking at it from several angles. One device side, our knee is out there and we have a limited release getting some clinical experience and feedback. The hip is not yet approved, it\u2019s coming in the next couple of months and we did the same with that. Get some limited release, get some feedback. And we are evaluating, we are still looking at spine ortho bundles and unique business models. But again, until we see something that is a disruptive path forward and it has to be a better opportunity and some of the other organic opportunities that we have. And so that\u2019s where we are.","Josh Jennings","Understand. And thanks for that answer. And just maybe a follow-up for Mike Coyle just thinking about the CVG performance in the quarter, maybe you can help us understand what went better than expected minus 4% was the guidance you guys hit 5% organic growth. And maybe also just touch on your performance in TAVR specifically and your outperformance of the market. And what do you think the drivers are there? Thanks for taking the questions.","Mike Coyle","Thanks, Josh. Certainly, coronary and structural heart was the big leader for us in the quarter both on the TAVR side and in the coronary side, obviously Onyx continues to do extremely well in the United States, where we are at sort of all-time high shares for our coronary business, but obviously the transcatheter valve business continues to have very good strength with nearly 20% growth on a global basis. That\u2019s really being driven by the Evolut PRO product release that\u2019s now available both in Europe and in the United States and we have supplemented that with the EnVeo delivery system, which is really being well received across the geographies. And we have had strong share capture in both Europe and Japan and have seen share momentum in the United States as well. And in Japan, we are just about to release now what we are releasing here in August, the Evolut PRO there as well. So, we expect that momentum to continue. But even in CRHF, we continue to see very strong growth in the atrial fibrillation business, our LVAD business with HVAD now has thoracotomy indication in addition to destination therapy and then within the APV business, the endovenous business is really doing extremely well and we haven\u2019t seen quite the hit we expected from the reimbursement reduction in drug-eluting balloons as the patient benefit of that has really been seen clearly by our customers. And so we have actually done quite a bit better than we expected in the plan despite that reimbursement change.","Josh Jennings","Thanks Mike.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Josh. Next question please, Lori?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Karen, you mentioned the ongoing noise around trade tariffs as one reason for some caution in the full year outlook. Could you spend a minute on how you are thinking about the potential impact on the business from what\u2019s going on there and maybe highlight any particular product categories where you see exposure?","Omar Ishrak","Let me first give you a little overview and then I will let Karen take over. First of all, the sorts of things that we sell are inherent needs for patients and we are confident that the healthcare systems around the world will lead our products and therefore in the end, there is a core demand that we will fulfill and that will continue. Now, having said that, clearly there are areas that are in the news and trade discussions that go on and we are a global company and we are affected by that. However, our overall confidence in our outlook and the way in which we are planning internally we are confident we can offset any real pressures in that area. And in the end, you have got to remember that the inherent demand for our technologies is something that no country can walk away from and it\u2019s something that we feel responsibility to fulfill for patients around the world, but Karen, maybe you can give a little more color to that?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. I would just add from a trade tariff perspective, it obviously depends on where we manufacture and where we export to China. And so, it\u2019s mostly impacting right now our MITG and RTG businesses to a lesser extent its impacting CVG. As Omar said, we are focused on at least as the current discussion fits on offsetting that as best we can. And as we noted, we did not change our EPS guidance taking into account the impact of the trade tariffs as they sit today.","Omar Ishrak","So, overall it\u2019s a modest impact and one that we feel we can cover.","Chris Pasquale","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then one question for Hooman, another very strong diabetes results this quarter, so just comment on the impact of the Animas wind down and the pace at which that\u2019s progressing you guys are offering some on-warranty patients the opportunity to switch early, is that accelerating this process to the point where we might see the bulk of that benefit here in the first year versus the 3 or 4 years that it would have taken just based on the timing of warranty expirations?","Hooman Hakami","So, Chris thanks for the question. Maybe a little bit of sort of color around just the revenue streams from Animas, the transition actually here is actually going pretty smoothly and we are really working well together with J&J on that. Now, your question is around the in-warranty, but let me remind you that there is actually three parts to the dynamic with Animas. They have got and they had roughly 90,000 patients in their installed base. The majority of those patients were under warranty and were coming off of warranty at a steady cadence. Now, starting this quarter, there are really three ways that were driving revenue. The first is for all the patients that are under warranty and remain under warranty, we are actually supplying those patients with consumables and we are recording that revenue. That revenue actually will start to anniversary in Q3 of this year. Second, for all the patients that are out of warranty, we are working to convert those patients to Medtronic, that\u2019s going extremely well. And we are converting them at least at the rate of our share position. And then the final one that your question touches on which really was a program that started in Q1 of this year is where we take certain in-warranty patients who have an Animas pump and we upgrade them to a Medtronic pump. And for those the convert there is we get compensated by J&J for that. And so the way that, that is going is actually well, it\u2019s ramping up. This was the first quarter where that\u2019s actually taking effect and we expect it to accelerate, but I think you have got to offset it with some of the other dynamics that I mentioned like the anniversary of the consumables.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Chris. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Can we spend a little bit of time on your Pain Therapies business and discuss the uptake of Intellis? And if you could also parse that a little bit, the difference between what\u2019s going on in the United States and what\u2019s going on internationally? That would be helpful.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Joanne for the question. The second part of the question is specifically about Pain Therapies.","Joanne Wuensch","Yes, please.","Omar Ishrak","Yes, okay. Alright, okay. Okay, Geoff go ahead.","Geoff Martha","Sure. What we are getting it\u2019s a combination and the uptake is a combination of Intellis, the system based on the features of the system combined with the evolved workflow, which is really driving the outcomes. And as you heard Omar say earlier in the commentary is it\u2019s we are getting very strong global growth, but even stronger growth \u2013 stronger growth in the U.S. And so what\u2019s converting is two drivers, one is the better system, it\u2019s smaller, faster recharge and physicians and patients are really like seeing the benefits of that. The second is the evolved workflow, where patients are \u2013 physicians and patients are seeing real world outcomes and it\u2019s being supported by some data that has been released and we plan to release some more interim data at NANS in January. So, we are very excited about it. And I don\u2019t know in terms of difference between o-U.S. and U.S., I think look the U.S. market is I think based on some of the opioid crisis and other things, there is more of a tailwind and we are seeing even a faster pickup, Omar mentioned 30% growth in the U.S., but we are still seeing 20% growth outside the U.S. So, it\u2019s pretty much a global phenomenon, but there is a stronger tailwind in the U.S. based on the opioid crisis and physicians and patients just looking for solutions to this crisis.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you. And as a follow-up in September we are going to see both TCT and NASS, anything you can comment on that we should look forward to? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Mike, you want to take the TCT and Geoff on NASS. Go ahead, Mike.","Mike Coyle","Yes, TCT, there will be good information flow coming on just the long-term performance of the TAVR products. We will be showing 5-year data on the core valve U.S. pivotal high risk patient cohort, which is important to showing the durability of outcome as well as being able to demonstrate that the durability of the products. And then we will have 2-year data on the [indiscernible] real world results randomized to the TAVR. So those will be I think important data points leading into what will be, I think an even more important meeting, which is ACC in the spring, where we will be showing the data on the low risk patient cohort in TAVR as well as the rapid results for our TYRX products. So, those are important data flows taking place over the balance of our fiscal year.","Omar Ishrak","Geoff?","Geoff Martha","Yes, we have a couple of things at NASS. One is the Mazor X Stealth Edition. So this will be the Mazor X with our Stealth Navigation System fully integrated which will provide a better workflow and ultimately we think better outcome. So, we are very excited about that. And then the second is our navigated Infinity system for spine. Our Infinity is our posterior cervical fixation system and again it is being released with a good workflow with our enabling technologies. Like I said, it\u2019s navigated. So, those would be two things I would highlight for NASS.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Joanne. We will take one more question please, Lori.","Operator","Okay. Your final question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter here and thanks for squeezing me in. So maybe one first starting off on the guidance, so Karen, it looks like FX was incrementally $0.05 worse or about 100 basis points of headwind. It looks like the top line was up by 50 basis points. So, what\u2019s top line improved by 50 basis points, but FX was 100 bps drag and despite that your EPS was maintained. Can you just comment on whether this underlying margin expansion where it\u2019s coming from just given Q1 trends?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. Thanks for the question, Vijay. We have got the intra-quarter timing of rate movements and mix that impacted our results both on the top line and on the bottom line, but really the benefits from our hedging program at this stage or what\u2019s positively, the key thing that\u2019s positively impacting our earnings.","Vijay Kumar","Well, I guess I meant for the guidance, FX was 100 bps headwind but top line was just up by 50 bps, it implies operating leverage should be coming in better than expected in the back, is that the underlying assumption?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. Clearly, we are focused on delivering operating margin improvement and we are committed to that 50 basis points margin improvement. Where we can we would like to continue to invest more in R&D and to accelerate R&D like we did in the first quarter. So we will continue to focus on that through the rest of the year. And obviously we did have the $0.05 impact on our bottom line, which we have noted.","Omar Ishrak","Vijay let me also say just to add to that, like I have said several times before we feel very good about this business both from a top line perspective and our programs in margin expansion that we are executing on to our enterprise expense efforts. Although that\u2019s still early, we are beginning to see results there. We want to set guidance that we have a high degree of confidence that we can deliver in. So, please read that into what we are saying here and we expect to execute and deliver and then we feel really good about this business both from a top line perspective as well as the margin expansion program perspective.","Vijay Kumar","I appreciate those comments, Omar. And just one quick follow-up to maybe Mike Coyle, so Mike, maybe your commentary around the TAVR side is talking about pricing competition in Europe. Maybe from your perspective, can you comment on any changing and comparative pricing dynamics, is it worsening, has it stabilized or what\u2019s going on in Europe? Thank you.","Mike Coyle","Pricing is reasonable stable in Europe. There is a small segment in the market that reacts to price, which is basically being driven by some of the smaller players in the market, but the major players have had really good pricing discipline and we expect that to continue in the balance of the year.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. With that, I want to thank everyone for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We are excited about this business. As you can hear, we are excited about our pipeline, about our growth trajectory, about our margin expansion programs and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our second quarter earnings call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, November 20. So thank you all very much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s Medtronic first quarter earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Weispfenning. Please go ahead.","Ryan Weispfenning","Great. Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2017 second quarter, which ended on October 28, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website investorrelations.medtronics.com.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and all year-over-year growth rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which adjusts for the effective foreign currency. Other than is noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, representing growth of 3%. Q2 non-GAAP operating profit grew 9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12 growing at 15% and representing EPS leverage of 1,120 basis points.","Q2 revenue was disappointing and did not meet our expectations. We faced issues that affected our growth, including slower than expected revenue as we await new product introductions. Despite this revenue shortfall, we produced strong improvement in operating margins and double-digit earnings per share growth. While some of the challenges that had an impact on revenue in Q2 could persist over the coming quarters, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth not only in our current fiscal year, but on a sustained basis into the future.","Now normally, the diversity of our revenue base overcomes any quarterly challenges. However, there were enough unexpected and unrelated issues in Q2 to collectively affect our revenue and each of our growth factors. Our new therapies growth vector, which contributed approximately 195 basis points to our total company growth, not only just fell below our goal of 200 to 250 basis points, but was well below our trend and expectations with the largest impacts from CVG and diabetes. In CVG, revenue growth was 3%, below our targeted high-end of the mid single-digit range and meaningfully below what we believe this business should be able to sustain.","In our CRHF division, strong growth contributions from diagnostics, atrial fibrillation and our recently acquired HeartWare LVAD business were offset by weakness in our core cardiac rhythm implantables business, which declined in the low single-digits. While we continue to take share in the U.S. ICD market, the market itself declined in the mid single-digits driven by high single-digit market declines in high-power device replacements. In the UK, our implantables revenue declined in the mid-teens as the National Health Service is changing its procurement model to limit bulk purchases causing a temporary disruption to normal buying patterns of the local products. We expect these pressures in CRHF to continue through the fiscal year.","Our CSH division was affected by transient market share losses due to the timing of new product cycles. For example, in the fast growing TAVR market, we lacked until recently, a large sized version of our Evolut R platform. And in drug eluting stents, our new Resolute Onyx DES is not yet available in the U.S. and Japan driving declines in those markets to competitive DES products. However, at the end of this quarter, we did receive FDA approval for Evolut R XL, which we expect to drive U.S. growth in the back half of our fiscal year. In addition, we expect the introduction of Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around fiscal year end and Resolute Onyx in Japan in FY \u201818. In our APV division, solid mid single-digit growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloons, which continues to lead the market and drive mid-20s growth. We expect this momentum to continue in the second half of our fiscal year.","Within our Diabetes Group, we were pleased with the earlier than expected FDA approval of the MiniMed 670G, which not only represents revolutionary technology toward a long-awaited closed loop insulin pump system, but also has been received with strong enthusiasm amongst the diabetes community.","However, the earlier than expected approval has created a bigger than expected gap between product approval and shipment. As a result, we created a priority access program for the 630G, which offers upgrade priority to the 670G when launched. We are seeing strong demand for this program primarily from early adopters. We do expect the majority of customers to wait to purchase the 670G once it launches in the spring of 2017.","In addition to this dynamic which is driving lower than expected pump and consumable sales, a portion of our 630G revenue is now deferred until receipt of the upgrade. Going forward, we expect some improved revenue growth for the remainder of this fiscal year and we expect diabetes to ultimately return to double-digit growth once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.","Our minimally invasive therapies group grew 4% in Q2, consistent with our goal of mid single-digit revenue growth primarily driven by our Open-to-MIS growth driver, including strong product sales of our recently launched Valleylab FT10 energy platform and continued performance of our endostapling specialty reloads. Surgical solutions came in slightly below our expectations primarily driven by the impact of competitive reprocessing of our advanced energy vessel sealing disposables in the U.S. We are confident in our ongoing strategies and new product launches that are designed to address this headwind.","Looking ahead, MITG expects to launch more than 15 new products in the second half of the fiscal year to drive growth, including a new powered stapling platform called Signia and new vessel sealing enhancements. This pipeline gives us confidence that MITG can continue to grow in the mid single-digits in the back half of the fiscal year.","Next, our Restorative Therapies Group grew 3% this quarter and our spine division continued to show improvement. Overall, spine growth was 1%, our strongest growth seven quarters as we gained global spine share. Our U.S. spine business grew 3% driven by continued adoption of infuse and strong adoption of our speed to scale launches and surgical synergy strategy, resulting in share gains along with sales of our navigation and imaging equipment in neurosurgery. RTG did suffer from a voluntary recall of certain neurovascular products which affected revenue. Some of these products will remain off the market in certain geographies for a period of time, but the most substantial impact of the recall is behind this as we bought back existing distributor inventory in Q2.","Across all of our groups, our product pipeline remains robust. We have important new growth catalysts that we expect to lead to improved second half growth. Some of these products have already been launched and others are coming to the market in the coming months. We are confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector and expect to be well within our 200 to 350 basis point goal in the back half of the year and over the longer term.","Next, let\u2019s turn to emerging markets, which grew 10% and contributed approximately 120 basis points to our total company growth slightly below our goal of 150 to 200 basis points. The primary driver was a shortfall in the Middle East, where our revenue declined in the mid single-digits as governments are dealing with an increased deficit, affected by declining oil prices. In Saudi Arabia, the largest market in the region and where we have a strong market leadership position, our overall business declined by approximately 40%, mostly impacting our CRHF, surgical solutions and spine divisions. We expect continued pressure in the Middle East for the remainder of the year, but we also believe that the basic demand for our critical life saving therapies will eventually rebound strongly.","On the positive side, our businesses in South Asia, ASEAN, Eastern Europe and Latin America all grew in the mid teens or higher. China, our largest emerging market, grew 11%, with a double digit growth in MITG and diabetes and high single-digit growth in CVG and RTG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we grew again in the low-20s, with strong growth coming from key tender wins in MITG. In ASEAN, growth was broad based, with double digit growth in Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines. In Eastern Europe, we grew over 20% in Russia as a result of strong momentum in CVG and MITG. Latin America also had strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina, driven in part by a new tender wins and continued channel optimization efforts. We expect current emerging market performance levels to be sustained in the back half of the year and continued to believe strongly as the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long-term.","Turning now to our third growth factor, services and solutions, which contributed 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 basis points to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve solid revenue growth, mostly from CVG-related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as new models are created and expanded across all our regions. We continued to see success in our hospital solutions business, through which we provide expertise in creating operational efficiency in both cath labs and operating rooms. We are also continuing to grow our chronic care models, including Diabeter for type 1 diabetes and NOK for morbid obesity, by pursuing global expansion opportunities. And finally, we formally launched our orthopedic solutions business earlier this month, a comprehensive program to help providers meet their CGR requirements in the U.S.","Before I turn the call over to Karen, let me reiterate that we are disappointed with our Q2 performance. That said, we also believe that these headwind events were largely temper in nature and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double digit EPS growth for the full year. What should not be lost in the discussion is that, despite revenue challenges this quarter, our organization delivered strong improvements in operating margins, including improvements in our gross margin and SG&A and met our goal of delivering double digit EPS growth.","Karen will now take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter financial results. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar. Our second quarter revenue of $7.345 billion increased 4% as reported or 3% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency had a positive $50 million impact on second quarter revenue. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately 120 basis points net to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.06 impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 15%. Strong operating performance helped to offset the revenue shortfall in the quarter. And the majority of the tax benefit during the quarter was offset by a worse than expected impact of foreign exchange on earnings.","In addition to the $385 million adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after tax basis were a $24 million charge for the HeartWare acquisition fair market value inventory step-up and a $35 million restructuring charge, and a $2 million charge for acquisition related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien, along with expenses related to our acquisition of, HeartWare offset by a net gain from the adjustments of our contingent consideration on prior acquisitions.","Our operating margin for the quarter was 28.9% on a constant currency basis, representing a strong 150 basis point year-over-year improvement. Efficiencies in both the gross margin and SG&A largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies drove the increase. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings in the fiscal year and expect to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of the fiscal year \u201818. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long-term margin expansion.","Net other expense was $89 million compared to $57 million in the prior year, reflecting about $90 million in reduced foreign exchange gains versus the prior year, primarily due to our hedging program, partially offset by a $48 million reduction in the U.S. medical device tax. While we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign exchange, FX can create modest volatility to the P&L above the operating margin line. [Technical Difficulty], a growing portion of our profits are un-hedged, especially from emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility throughout the P&L.","Looking ahead, we remain committed to our plan to generate 130 basis points to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margins this fiscal year. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $173 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $32.4 billion in debt and $11.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 14.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast and included $42 million of operational net tax benefit, primarily related to the write-off of a deferred tax liability associated with the prior impairment of an investment in a foreign subsidiary. While we have had tax benefits in both Q1 and Q2, we continue to forecast a tax rate of approximately 17% for the second half of the fiscal year.","Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We are deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline, with the focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $593 million in dividends and repurchased a net $985 million of our ordinary shares in the second quarter. This represented a total payout ratio of 101% on non-GAAP net income and 142% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind our payout ratio is elevated as we not only returned 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute on our commitment to return $5 billion through incremental share repurchases by the end of fiscal year \u201818. At quarter end, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 39 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.393 billion shares.","Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude with our outlook. As Omar mentioned, we continued to expect to deliver mid single-digit revenue and double digit EPS growth this fiscal year and we expect our revenue growth to improve from the disappointing growth this past quarter. However, given the issues we outlined in the second quarter, some of which could persist in the near-term, we now expect our full year revenue growth to be within the mid single-digit range on a constant currency constant weeks basis as opposed to the upper half of that range signaled previously. Moving to the back half of the fiscal year, we expect revenue growth to also be in the mid single-digit range on a constant currency basis.","With regard to our business groups, we continued to expect MITG grow in the mid single-digits. And we expect RTG to grow in the low end of the mid single-digit range, ramping in the back half of the year. While we expect improvement from the headwinds faced in CVG and diabetes in the second quarter, we recognized that until some of our important new products officially launched, revenue growth is likely to continue to be affected. For that reason, in the back half of this fiscal year, we expect CVG to deliver mid single-digit and diabetes to deliver mid to high single-digit revenue growth. Keep in mind that CVG had a strong finish to last fiscal year. So, on an annual comparison basis, we expect slightly slower growth in the fourth quarter. And because we do not expect the 670G to be on the market until the end of this fiscal year, we expect growth in diabetes to ramp through the back half, with stronger growth in the fourth quarter than the third. We continue to expect diabetes to ultimately reach double-digit revenue growth as signaled in the past once the 670G is fully on the market next fiscal year.","While the impacts from currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rates, which included \u20ac1.6 [ph] and \u00a5110 remained stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect our full year revenue to be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $60 million, including an approximate $10 million to $30 million negative impact in the third quarter.","With respect to earnings, we continue to expect double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency constant week basis for the full fiscal year. For the back half of the fiscal year, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS growth to be in the 8% to 10% range on a constant currency basis given slightly less than previously expected revenue, a more normal 17% expected tax rate and the loss of the year-over-year benefit from a lower medical device tax starting in December. Taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week in the first quarter last fiscal year as well as an estimated negative foreign currency impact to our full year EPS of $0.20 to $0.22 if current exchange rates remain stable, this EPS growth implies full year non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.55 to $4.60.","Lastly, we are modifying our free cash flow outlook methodology. Recall that last quarter, we were forecasting an adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal year \u201817, a range that would exclude cash payments related to non-GAAP items that might occur during the year. Going forward, we will include these items to more closely align our free cash flow projection with the results we report each quarter. However, in light of the unpredictability of the precise amount and timing of cash payments, we are expanding the range. Given this, along with the revenue and net income expectations already discussed, we expect our free cash flow for the fiscal year to be in the range of $5 billion to $6 billion.","Now, I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen. And we will open the lines for Q&A. But before we do, I wanted to reiterate what for me are the three key points about our Q2 performance. First, we are disappointed in our revenue performance this quarter. The issues that caused the shortfall are identifiable, and in many cases, temporary. As I mentioned, we have several new product introductions in the back half of the year that we expect to drive our revenue growth back to our normal range. Second, despite our revenue challenges, our organization delivered an operational discipline, including driving the expected Covidian synergies, which led to strong operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. And third, looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth, not only in our current fiscal year, but on a sustained basis in the future. And as always, we remain focused in creating long-term dependable value for our shareholders.","We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the questions. So, Omar, I think there is pieces of it I think that people understand the comments ranging from the diabetes business and just the impact on demand because of the timing of 670G or Saudi Arabia having a significant drop off obviously in demand. I think probably the best way to think about kind of one question investors are going to have today is on the U.S. business. And so if we looked at the U.S. growth corporate-wide on an organic basis, it\u2019s basically flat this quarter. So, I would love to hear just kind of the group\u2019s thoughts on the health of the U.S. device market and what appears to be some slowdown at least reflected in your results and some other company\u2019s results over the last quarter?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. Thanks Mike. I think the primary driver for us though is the fact that the U.S. is more sensitive to new product cadence and we are big enough in the market it reflects the market up and down a little bit ourselves. And as we launch new products in the U.S., I think we will benefit accordingly. Like I mentioned earlier, in CVG, we just launched the Evolut R XL, which will contribute to U.S. growth in the second half and also the introduction of the Evolut Pro and Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of the fiscal year. You mentioned diabetes, that\u2019s primarily a U.S. launch on the 670G, so that we think again will have a big impact in the market and the slowdown in diabetes was mostly in the U.S. again, which again impacted the overall market. In MITG, we are launching over 15 new products in the second half to drive growth. And in RTG, our continued drive on our speed to scale launches and so on in addition to our sales in navigation and imaging should all help the U.S. So, we think this is a lot in our own control and through successful execution of new product introductions I think will make an impact.","Mike Weinstein","And Omar, if I looked at it, just \u2013 with respect just a little bit, so it\u2019s always harder to tell just on a quarter-to-quarter basis in some of the implantables businesses such as CRM, but if I look at surgical solutions, the U.S. growth in surgical solutions, which is pretty good barometer for device market growth was lighter this quarter. So, maybe just \u2013 if you just want to kind of comment on that? And then just the follow-up unrelated to the actual quarters, I know there are lot of questions coming out of the outcome of the U.S. election and the potential for corporate tax reforms. So Karen, I don\u2019t know if you have any preliminary thoughts on the potential implications of tax reform in the U.S. on the company both from a change in how tax rates are ultimately calculated and to the access to cash? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Well, there was number of points there, Mike. First, from a surgical solutions perspective, while it is a barometer in the overall market, there were greater activities than we usually have on reprocessing, which \u2013 and for which we are addressing that through some new launches in the second half, so we think that will impact the market. And again, like I said before, because we are so big in the market, it does move the overall market up and down depending on what we do. I really don\u2019t have any hard data to comment on the overall procedures that would really worry me as a big factor. I think our own performance is the bigger thing here. With respect to the other points, Mike, it\u2019s too early for me to comment on any changes and so on. I mean in the end, we go back to our universal healthcare needs, improving clinical outcomes, driving value-based healthcare, increasing access. Irrespective of the government and irrespective of the country for that matter, those are the priorities and that\u2019s what we stay focused on. I think as long as any reform focuses on that, I think it will be accepted and it will be successful. It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s one that we must collectively address.","With respect to the tax situation, again, I don\u2019t want to speculate on what may or may not happen here. But I just want to reiterate that the reason we did the Covidian acquisition was operational. It was primarily driven by market synergies and broadening of our business and the way in which we can drive healthcare. At that time, that was the best structure and we continue to believe that, that is the right way for us in getting access to our cash, which we have deployed effectively. I am just going to leave it at that. We will see how things rollout and we will kind of go from there. But like I have said many times before, we like to control the things if we can control and execute those well. The rest will happen around us and it\u2019s tough for me to speculate. Thanks.","Mike Weinstein","Understood. Thank you, Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","Karen Parkhill","Good morning David.","David Lewis","I am sorry, can you hear me.","Omar Ishrak","Sure, we can David. Go ahead.","David Lewis","Thank you. Sorry about that. So I appreciate your comments about sort of the growth being in your own control and then I think investors want to hear that, but I think it\u2019s sort of undeniable in this last quarter that U.S. implanters saw 2 points of comp adjusted deceleration, so something happened in the U.S. and I think people want to just understand how much visibility you have on sort of this back half improving of about 100 basis points, so I guess the question once again is, you have a different pacing of months relative to your peers, I mean have you seen enough stability or improvement in the last couple of months to believe that whatever happen in the U.S. market here in this quarter, at least it\u2019s stable now and that\u2019s something you can sort of build upon with your new products, so I do still think there has to be some market effect here with these new products to get investors comfortable that at least the market in your mind is stable to improving?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. That\u2019s a fair point, David. The only thing that we pointed out was the device replacements where we are certainly slower. But I will let Mike Coyle comment on the CRM market and I will also let Bryan comment briefly on the surgical market, because I think that\u2019s an important question you are asking, so Mike, go ahead and just answer the question directly.","Mike Coyle","David, the bigger impact was in the high power segment. In fact, the pacing market was pretty much in line with what we were expecting. So the high power side of the equation, we saw a slightly lower growth in initial implants, but we are now looking at high single-digit declines in replacements for the market and that\u2019s something different than we have seen historically. As we go forward, we think that we are in a particularly impacted area for CRT and that that will get better going forward, but we also expect on the high power side for standardized CDs that there will be this replacement headwind. But it\u2019s principally coming from the fact that there was lower device implants here 5 years 7 years ago when these devices were deep within in terms of initial trajectory. But even more important impact is the lengthening life of these devices because of the improvements that we have made to the technology to extend their battery life and that will be a bit of a headwind for us going forward. But what\u2019s going to work in our favor is the pipeline. If you remember from TCT, in the first half of the year, I think across all of our businesses within CVG, I think we probably had four or five new product introductions in major geographies. That\u2019s going to be up to about 25 in the back half, with some very important ones in the device implantables area, including extending the 3T MRI, bringing the Visia AF to Japan and a large number of other ones that I mentioned at TCT and identified as being catalyst for us going forward. So I think those are going to be things that we can count on to help our share position and hopefully also help with market growth.","Omar Ishrak","Bryan, a brief comment on the U.S. market?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. Obviously, we are pretty focused on the same thing. We look at a number of different data points and hearing comments from folks like yourself and other businesses. And I hear some people say that things are stable and some people say it\u2019s down. I look internally first to try to get a sense and I kind of hear mix the same way. So until I see something definitive, I feel like the procedures have stayed stable from quarter-to-quarter. And even if I saw something in the quarter, unless I see a couple of quarters in a row, there is not really a solid data point there. So I haven\u2019t seen anything or feel we should redirect on volume.","David Lewis","Okay. And just maybe two quick follow-ups, Omar, maybe one for Hooman and one for Karen, so Hooman just I think we all understand the disruption in light the 670G, but I think earlier on, a few months ago, there was more enthusiasm around 630G and the reward program just sort of bridge that gap and I guess the question is, did something changed in sort of your view about the receptivity of 630G and the transition of reward program, that\u2019s first question. And for Karen, can you just update us where we are on the buyback program, I think the commentary was most of that was going to get completed in the earlier part of the year, have we basically exhausted that buyback or what\u2019s remaining for the remainder of the year? Thanks so much.","Hooman Hakami","Okay. David, with the 630G, your question specifically look, what I would say is, once we have this product in the hands of our sales team and in front of physicians and patients, we actually saw a good momentum with the product. Maybe just to provide a reminder, this was approved in early August. And it takes a few weeks to demo it, to get it in front of the sales team, to get it in front of physicians and that makes August for us a tough comparison. Then when we get the 670 approved, which was much earlier than expected, we implemented the priority access program. And we saw, as the commentary suggested, some good up-tick with respect to that, but primarily from early adopters. So I think if you take a look at it on balance, I think the 630, once it was in the marketplace, it performed well. I think our dynamic, which was surely U.S. based, was the fact that in less than two months, we had two major product approvals in the same geography. And there is operational transition that comes with this and there is a degree of, I would say, perhaps confusion and disruption to demand because of that and that was really the biggest catalyst. Now going forward, we still remain very excited that the enthusiasm around the 670 is great, so we think that, as the commentary suggested, we are going to ramp, but once this thing is full scale, we will return to double digit growth.","Karen Parkhill","And David on the buyback comment, we have purchased 2.5 billion so far this year. We continue to remain committed to repurchasing a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow, along with that incremental $5 billion repurchase that we expect to complete over a 3-year timeframe for fiscal \u201816 to \u201818. As you do know, we typically do front end load our share buybacks not only in the fiscal year, but even this $5 billion incremental share buyback, we have tended to upload \u2013 to front load in that 3-year timeframe. We still do have some incremental buybacks to go in the second half. Some of that related to our free cash flow and some of that related to continuing to repurchase the $5 billion, but we typically do front-end load.","David Lewis","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Karen Parkhill","Good morning Kristen.","Kristen Stewart","Can you guys hear me?","Omar Ishrak","Yes Kristen, go ahead. Kristen can\u2019t hear you any more?","Kristen Stewart","Can you hear me now?","Omar Ishrak","Yes.","Kristen Stewart","Sorry. In light of these results, does this change your thoughts on maybe smaller incremental tuck-in acquisitions, I know you seemed pretty confident that these are more transient issues, but how are you just thinking from an M&A perspective in the market?","Omar Ishrak","No, I think to some degree, we have executed well on the M&A, both small, as well as midsized tuck-in acquisitions. And they helped us actually this quarter in diversifying our revenue base and giving us a much needed boost. I think our ability to execute those is pretty good and I am thinking about those the right way. As I have said before, we are disciplined about our cash allocation and we have done a lot this year, so we are watching it very carefully. And the bar is a little high. But that\u2019s purely to do with our capital allocation, not to do with our execution or any of these market dynamics. I think in many ways, we continue to look at different opportunities.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then is there any \u2013 I don\u2019t know how large the deferral is right now, is there anything to quantify, maybe on a diabetes side, how large the deferrals are impacting that growth rate right now?","Omar Ishrak","I think it\u2019s tough to quantify that. That\u2019s a portion of the drop in our growth rates in diabetes. I think the delay in actual shipment is the bigger portion, but the delay is \u2013 the deferral is only a limited amount.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Kristen. Take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks and good morning. Can you hear me, okay?","Omar Ishrak","Yes, we can. Thanks Bob. Go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Good morning. So, thanks for taking the questions. I want to start out just \u2013 I think it would be helpful if you guys could try to quantify the things that you are saying were temporary or kind of one-time in nature for this fiscal second quarter, so either in aggregate or broken down by the various things that you kind of called out like the neuro recall, diabetes, the tenders, is there a way to kind of quantify that and the impact on revenue growth for Q2?","Karen Parkhill","In general, I would say Bob that the headwinds that we faced in the quarter caused us to move from our typical mid single-digit growth range to the 3%. And again, we don\u2019t think that, that is something that will continue. We haave guided in the back half to go back to the mid single-digit range.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. So, just as a broad comment, but no specific quantification. Okay, so the other things I wanted to just ask about real quickly was, Karen, one for you, can you just give us a sense as to the free cash flow guidance you are giving for \u201817 on an apples-to-apples basis, because I know you are changed in the way you are talking about it? So, what was it at the beginning of the year, what is it now? And then for Mike or Omar, I was wondering if you could just comment on the TAVR business, now both you and Edwards have reported numbers that were a little bit below what the Street was forecasting. Can you just comment on the state of the TAVR market? And also on the state of the U.S. ICD market like what\u2019s \u2013 I mean, things have really slowed down there. What\u2019s the sustainable growth rate in your mind at this point? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Karen, go ahead.","Karen Parkhill","Yes. On free cash flow, yes, we are changing our guidance to match what our actual free cash flow is as opposed to before the one-time items that can impact the cash flow. So, our former guidance was $6.5 billion to $7 billion adjusted, not including those one-time items. And going forward as I said, we will be doing the \u2013 trying to match what our actual free cash flow is with $5 billion to $6 billion. I don\u2019t have an actual apples-to-apples because it\u2019s very difficult to predict those one-time items. But I would say that, in general, the cash flow guidance has not changed substantially, it\u2019s just that going forward we will be focused on trying to focus on the actual and that\u2019s based on feedback that we have gotten from several investors.","Omar Ishrak","Mike, do you want to take the market question from cardiology?","Mike Coyle","In terms of TAVR, the overall market grew around 30%. We obviously were in the high-teens sort of the story of international versus U.S. right? In the U.S., we are waiting for the 34 millimeter to impact the market. We expect to be able to then participate in the market growth that we are seeing, which we think is actually quite strong for the U.S. In terms of high power, during the quarter, it looked like market growth was on the order of down mid single-digits. We actually did a bit better than that, because of share capture. And as I mentioned, we have a pretty robust set of new products at TBT \u2013 at TCT that we expect to help us grow faster than the market. Our models would tell us things should moderate a bit relative to the replacement cycle, but a bit I mean I think we are still looking at down market in the low to mid single-digits.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Bob. Can we take the next question?","Bob Hopkins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS.","Matt Miksic","Hey, thanks for taking the questions. So, I think we have covered a lot of the sort of top line issues in the quarter. I wanted to, Omar, ask you about something that came out of the Wheat Symposium in your presentation with the aortic and peripheral group there. Just on contracting, something you have not commented on before, the amount of sort of multi-line contracting that you have seen taken up in the U.S. and something that was presented there took that maybe a step further into introducing this idea of a warranty offer just in exchange for commitments from clients. And love if you could elaborate a little bit on that and maybe where you see if you see the application of that in other areas? And I have one follow-up.","Omar Ishrak","Well, I am going to make a brief comment on this and then I will let Mike kind of comment a little further on the specifics of the example that you state. But the main overriding comment I want to make is that the example that you state is truly an example of value-based healthcare. And value-based healthcare means that we become a company who are paid for outcomes as opposed to the product itself and that\u2019s a long-term journey, but eventually, we think that that\u2019s the right thing for healthcare, that\u2019s the right thing for us. It will make us more efficient team in our R&D and we will get rewarded for what we innovate and healthcare will get the right value and in the long-term improve outcomes and lower cost. So, that model you will see us replicate in many other areas. And like I have described in the chronic care world, with the diabetes and with the NOK and we have talked a lot about our antibacterial sleeve, which also is the same kind of model. So, you will see a lot of these things from us, these value-based healthcare models and that one example that you state is only the beginning. I think our size helps us with a seat at the table to do these contracts. And so I think it will give us a differentiated advantage not only because of our size, but because of our ability to innovate and link them to outcomes. Mike, any quick specifics on the particular example at the beginning?","Mike Coyle","Yes. As you mentioned, we have been attempting to drive more of our revenue into multi-line contracts and create stickiness of share versus new products coming into the market and we are now up to 38% of CVG revenue in the U.S. is tied up in multi-line contracts. So, what you have specifically identified is the trend that we are trying to basically take products where we have clearly demonstrated superior outcomes and then create performance guarantees that allow us to then do what Omar said, become a value-based healthcare company. We have done that extensively with the anti-infective envelope TYRX in the CRM business and what was being outlined by the APV team there at Wheat was really using the strong clinical evidence around Endurant, Endurant 2S to basically create performance guarantees to drive market share in that segment.","Matt Miksic","That\u2019s helpful. And to follow-up just understanding the disappointing growth on the quarter for a variety of the reasons that you have talked about and has been discussed on the call. If you could maybe revisit the long-term growth this mid single-digit growth objective that you have put out there? And what the components of that are, understanding expecting an improvement in the back half, should this include \u2013 should we expect this to include, obviously, in the contribution of hardware this year, incremental other acquisitions going forward? Any thoughts on just geography and where you are with the growth rate as you have talked about? Just how do you get there and what are the components of that? That would be very helpful.","Omar Ishrak","First, let me point out that we haven\u2019t come off the mid single-digit estimate for the year. We are still saying that. And this quarter is not one that we are happy with like I have said and it\u2019s not one that we are going to repeat. And so we are completely confident in our ability to drive sustained mid single-digit growth and all our strategies are aimed towards that and those strategies cover our ability to produce new products across a variety of market segments. Typically, that diversity would protect us. It just so happened this quarter that a collection of them all happened together. In addition to that, we have got geographic diversity which we are building and that\u2019s our drive towards emerging markets where we have actually even with the enormous impact in Saudi, still delivered close to \u2013 at 10% emerging market growth, short of our overall set of basis point target of 150 to 200, but one that we think will pickup over time and we want to get more to the middle of that target rather than the low end. And the services and solutions is a longer term effort, but again another one which will give us sustained growth in the long-term. So, we are deploying multiple strategies for a sustained and consistent mid single-digit growth, which employs addressing new therapies, cadence of product innovation, different market segments within that, geographic diversification, the real focus in emerging markets, and creating this new services and solutions growth vector, along the lines that you described earlier based on our value-based healthcare initiatives.","Matt Miksic","And strategic investment \u2013 I am sorry to interrupt, Omar, but \u2013 and strategic investment also part of that in not one of your vectors per se, but I guess how would you think about that in terms of your growth target?","Omar Ishrak","No, strategic investments would be \u2013 well, let\u2019s put it in two ways. First of all, tuck-in acquisitions, is part of our overall mid single-digit sort of targeting. And you recall that we are driving these tuck-in acquisitions where we are balancing internal costs. So, we are not changing our EPS guidance \u2013 double-digit EPS growth guidance stays the same while we do these acquisitions. So, we consider them, although acquisitions, we make internal trade-offs to fund them. So, that\u2019s the way think about those. Bigger strategic acquisitions, they are always possible like we have done in the past, but they have to drive our strategies, that actually was strategic fit that we can satisfy and quantify for ourselves before we go into that. So, that\u2019s the way we look at it.","Matt Miksic","Very helpful color. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Matt. Take the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s just starting off with the fiscal 2017 guidance I think it will be helpful if you can talk a little bit about where you would expect things to get better in the third and fourth quarters versus the second quarter, so you grew 3% constant currency this quarter, it sounds like you expect that to improve in the third quarter, is that correct and can you talk a little bit about specifically what gets better. And then on the EPS guidance, I know you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, but typically I think the third quarter is about $0.03 higher than the second quarter, do you expect that to be the case this year?","Omar Ishrak","Let me take the revenue question. We were pretty clear in the sense that there is a whole series of new product launches that will come in the back half, all the way from TAVR to the \u2013 towards the end of the fiscal year, the Resolute Onyx. We have got 15 new product introductions in surgical solutions. We will address the reprocessing. And most importantly, we have got the 670G, which we will launch towards the end of the fiscal year and we expect a ramp up in growth as the next two quarters go by. So we do think that a significant shift in our new product cadence will give us enough growth to take us well in the single digit range in the back half. And also we haven\u2019t talked much about it, but the improvement in spine and the RTG growth starts to move up the mid single-digit range, which it wasn\u2019t before, so all of these are the main factors. To be clear look, we stated that the device replacement market in ICDs will continue to slow. We are not expecting that to turnaround. We expect the NHS and the buying patterns in the UK to remain slow for the remainder of the year. We expect the Middle East to remain where it is. So we are going to say that those market trends will continue. The rest are all new product related and our cadence will address it. I think that\u2019s the brunt of it.","Karen Parkhill","And I would just add because you are asking about quarterly gating, too. For CVG in particular, we do expect a little bit stronger growth rate in the third quarter than the fourth quarter just given a very strong finish at the end of the year for that business. And as I mentioned, in RTG, because of the product introduction, we do expect that to ramp up through the back half from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, same with diabetes, a ramp up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. In terms of EPS, it\u2019s typically flat, so there is not a big difference that you had mentioned in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And we don\u2019t particularly give guidance.","Larry Biegelsen","Understood. But just to be clear, do you expect to be in the mid single-digit range in fiscal Q3. And just lastly, given the results this quarter, how do you feel about the long-term operating margin goals, you provided at the Analyst Meeting this past June? Thanks for taking my questions.","Omar Ishrak","First, we expect to be in the mid single-digit in the back half and in the early part of the \u2013 in Q3 as well and I think we stated that. Look, I will state it again. We don\u2019t want to make a habit of missing the mid single-digit goal even in the quarter and I am extremely focused on that and one that we will address. So our mid single-digit goal is one that certainly for the year is still valid and one that we expect to get back during the second half of the year. In terms of the operating margin, I mean that was one of the positives of this quarter that we did deliver a strong operating margin improvement, 150 basis points of constant currency improvement. We are on track. Our synergies are coming up. Our value capture programs are all delivering. Our gross margins actually are in line with what we expect. So we are certainly still think with what we presented at the Analyst Conference in terms of our operating margin enhancements and I think this quarter is a signal that we in fact can execute towards that. No, we are going to do that in future quarters, but that\u2019s the way we see it right now.","Karen Parkhill","And we have talked about that operating leverage improving throughout the year. So in the first quarter, we had 100 basis points improvement, second quarter, 150 basis points and we expect it to continue to get a little bit better from here.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good morning. I wonder if I could ask a little bit about the idea of growth accelerating again towards the back half, I know it\u2019s been covered quite a bit, but part of what potentially we are seeing though is that as some of these product cycles wane and some of your competitors launch sort of responsive products, the question is really, is what\u2019s your bringing enough to replace what is sort of waning and is it really just a situation where perhaps, the better parts of some of these businesses may be behind you for a period of time?","Omar Ishrak","No, we don\u2019t think so. I think you just got to look at the product case and I mean if I take that bit, for example, I mean clearly, that\u2019s a revolutionary new product which didn\u2019t hit the market at all and we think the benefits of that are yet to come. I mean that\u2019s a clear example of a breakthrough product line. And then I think in both CVG and in MITG and certainly in RTG, in all our product segments, I mean these are strong products, stuff that we are doing with in the transcatheter market are significant enhancements that due to what we had before and we expect traction on those. So we think our product pipeline is robust. We described that in the Analyst Meeting. We haven\u2019t come off any of that. Our feeling about their impact is no less than what it was then. It\u2019s just so happened that the timing of these launches, coupled with some really severe market headwinds, all at the same time, just kind of \u2013 those are concurrence of these events in one quarter and we expect that, that sort of collection of circumstances not to repeat. And we think that the new products, the robustness of our pipeline will come through and we will get the appropriate benefits. So our excitement around new products is not \u2013 and our confidence has not been shaken at all as to their viability and what they can do to the market and to patients.","Raj Denhoy","Fair enough. And then maybe just one quick one on the new orthopedic offering, which you gave a little more detail around, perhaps you could just help us understand or frame the opportunity in terms of what you expect from that, because there are sort of two pieces to it right, there is the consulting services, but then there is also the unique aspect of bringing in orthopedic, knee line in the market and so maybe if you can give us some high level thoughts on how you think that business will start to contribute over the next couple of years?","Omar Ishrak","I think I am actually going to let Geoff is going to \u2013 why don\u2019t you go ahead Geoff, with some color on that?","Geoff Martha","Yes, sure. Raj, we are right now, obviously, this is new for us and we haven\u2019t even \u2013 we don\u2019t have a scalable amount of the need to sell quite yet. So the early interest that we are seeing is strong from surgeons that have skin in the game and we are seeing demand, that\u2019s for the knee. And then for hospitals, there is a lot of interest around these. We are sharing partnerships, but it\u2019s new to them and these are complex agreements that\u2019s taking a little bit more time, but we are feeling bullish about this. But we haven\u2019t provided any specific guidance yet because it is so new, the concept, right. You have got these risk bearing partnerships and that\u2019s really the centerpiece of the offering. And it\u2019s very difficult to forecast the speed of the ramp and so we haven\u2019t provided any guidance. I will just tell you that we are still feeling \u2013 we are happy with the response we are getting and we are still feeling positive about it, both the risk bearing partnership component, which is the centerpiece and then the underlying technologies, the [indiscernible] technology that we saw in our advanced energy business, as well as the new implants, the knee and down the road to hip.","Raj Denhoy","Great. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Raj. We will go to the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Omar, I was hoping you could help us out thinking into calendar \u201817, there has been some concerns with Trump being elected and a threat of an ACA repeal that volumes could suffer as there is either a transition or a formal repeal of the Affordable Care Act, can you help us think about that. And in the setting of the fiscal Q2 performance, the organic growth in the first half has been challenged and was just \u2013 one of the leverage you guys haven\u2019t pulled is pruning post the Covidien acquisition, any thoughts there in terms of accelerating that process or that initiative?","Omar Ishrak","Well, let me take those questions one at a time. First of all, with respect to the healthcare policy again, I don\u2019t want to speculate as to what\u2019s going to happen here, but what I do know, which I have stated consistently in the past, is that a move towards value based healthcare, a move towards a regime where the entire healthcare market gets rewarded for producing better outcomes will not only lower costs, but that\u2019s the only way forward. And it doesn\u2019t really matter which administration is in place or in which country you are in. That is a basic fact garnered in logic. And I think focus around that will prevail and I think that will be important in any future policies that are made and there is an alignment of stakeholders pushing in that direction. With respect to the pruning, look \u2013 we look at divestitures and acquisitions with the same lens. Does it fit our strategy? Can we win in that marketplace? Can we \u2013 do our financial metrics of returning 50% back to the shareholders and then growing mid single-digits and double-digit EPS growth? I mean, do those financial metrics, are they in line with that acquisition or not or divestiture or not? And based on those factors, we make decisions. And certainly, we are looking at different areas of our business all the time and you should expect to get periodic updates from us on that score. Did I miss any point?","Josh Jennings","No. Thanks for that. If I could just ask one for Karen, just on looking out into next year, I know it\u2019s impossible to predict currency moves. But if the currency rates would remain constant here, can you help us understand whether there would be a headwind or tailwind in terms of hedging gains or losses in fiscal \u201818? And just the reason I am asking is because we do have the medical device tax benefit rolling off next year starting in fiscal 2Q. So, I just wanted to get a sense of when the reported operating margin would more closely mirror the constant currency operating margin performance? Thanks a lot.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, no, happy to take that. So what I mentioned is, we certainly can\u2019t predict exchange rates, but if they do remain stable where they are today and two of the biggest rates that we are exposed to are the euro and the yen. So if they remain stable to about \u20ac1.06 [ph] and \u00a5110 for the remainder of the fiscal year, I mentioned we would expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by approximately $20 million to $60 million. And on an EPS basis and this takes into account our hedging program too, it\u2019s not just our natural exposure. And on an EPS basis, we would expect full year EPS to be $0.20 to $0.22 impacted and we will give guidance for FY \u201818 when we typically do at a later date.","Omar Ishrak","Great. Thanks, Josh. Let\u2019s take one more question. Got time for one more.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. One for Mike and then a quick one for Karen. Mike, your U.S. TAVR share is down about 10 points by our math over the past year. That\u2019s a pretty big shift. How much of that do you think was the lack of a large Annulus product? And are you seeing in just the couple of weeks here since the approval a noticeable pickup in those cases?","Mike Coyle","The vast majority of that share decline is in that segment. We would estimate it represents about 25% to 30% of the overall market and our shares there were substantially lower than in the other three sides. So, as we bring that in we would expect it to normalize those shares and grow above the market as we do.","Chris Pasquale","Okay. And then Karen, tax has been a pretty meaningful source of upside over the past couple of quarters. You mentioned you expect it to go back up to about 17% in the back half of the year. Just walk through why that is? Why that shouldn\u2019t stay at the rates we have seen the last couple of quarters?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. It\u2019s very difficult to predict the one-time benefits that we would get in tax. They are spotty. They tend to be large. They impacted us positively this quarter. But we can\u2019t count on them all the time and so that\u2019s why we focus on our more normal 17% tax rate going forward.","Chris Pasquale","Okay, thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Chris. Okay. So with that, it\u2019s time to end the call. But before I finish, I have to repeat the three main points about this call and about our performance and outlook. Like I have said several times, we are not happy about the revenue performance this quarter, but we do think that the shortfall, the reasons of the shortfall are identifiable and in most cases temporary and we expect our new product introductions primarily to drive a recovery in the back half of the year and in longer term. Second, look, please acknowledge \u2013 we acknowledge the fact that our organization delivered an operational discipline and delivered strong operating margin and double-digit EPS growth this quarter. And finally, we remain confident in our overall strategy that we laid out in our Analyst Meeting, double-digit \u2013 mid single-digit revenue growth and double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency basis, not only this fiscal year, but sustained into the future, and that is something that we are certainly not coming off.","Okay. So with that, I would like to thank you all for your interest and your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, also thank you for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your families a very happy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 21. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal year 2020 first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our first quarter, which ended on July 26, 2019. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. During today\u2019s earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","For this call, unless we say otherwise, rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which compares to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 after adjusting for foreign currency. References to organic revenue growth exclude the impact of material acquisitions and currency. Reconciliations of these and all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported solid quarterly results and we are off to a good start to the fiscal year. Despite tough comparisons, we delivered revenue growth, operating margin and EPS all ahead of Street expectations.","Q1 revenue grew 3.5% constant currency with outperformances in CVG, MITG and RTG, while diabetes matched our expectations. This reflects the success in the market of our innovation and the benefit of our business and geographic diversification. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points, including currency and 70 basis points, constant currency, as we continue to see the benefits of our enterprise excellence initiatives particularly on the SG&A line. On the bottom line, we grew diluted EPS 7.7% or 9.4% at constant currency, despite a 230-basis point headwind on EPS growth from the increase in our non-GAAP nominal tax rate.","Let\u2019s discuss some of the more important drivers of our performance, starting with our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which delivered another strong quarter and surpassed our expectations, growing 4.8%. Through diversifying our sterilization supply network, we overcame the challenges related to a suppliers sterilization facility shutdown in February, returning to full sterilization capacity during the quarter. In Surgical Innovations, Advanced Stapling grew mid-single digits and Advanced Energy, high single digits. This was driven by new innovations in our Tri-Staple and LigaSure franchises, including our new EEA circular stapler with Tri-Staple technology and our Ligasure Exact dissector.","Respiratory GI and renal also had a strong quarter, led by double-digit growth in GI Solutions and mid-single-digit growth in respiratory and patient monitoring. In CVG, we grew 1.4%, which was ahead of our expectations. CVG\u2019s growth continues to be tempered by challenges in drug-coated balloons, LVADs as well as CRM replacement devices given the longer life batteries we launched several years ago. Regarding DCBs, we are encouraged by our better than expected performance, but there are case volume increased following the FDA panel in June. We were also encouraged by the path forward outlined by the FDA in their letter to physicians earlier this month.","In CRHF our pacing business is strong, growing 5% as our disruptive innovation in the micro single chamber transcatheter pacing system is taking share and expanding the market. Our U.S. single chamber pacemaker share is now over 65% with our revenue share over 80%. In TAVR, we saw both the market and our growth accelerate to the mid-teens in Q1 on the back of the low risk, data presentations at ACC. CMS published the final TAVR NCD memo in June and we expect this will result in approximately 200 new TAVR centers in the US. We\u2019re already in active negotiations with about half of these centers, which are ready to start as we aim to become their preferred partner in TAVR devices. In CVG, it is also worth noting that double-digit growth contributions from our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft or VenaSeal Closure System and also our TYRX absorbable antibacterial envelope, which continue to accelerate both rapid data presentation at ACC.","In addition, both our Reveal LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor and Arctic front cryoablation products grew in the high single digits.","In diabetes, we grew 5.4% and this was despite our U.S. business declining mid-single digits because of competitive challenges and the difficult comparisons versus the prior year when our U.S. business grew 33%. Our International business, which represents approximately half of our diabetes revenue grew 20%, The MiniMed 670G, which drove strong growth in the U.S. last year, is now experiencing that same strong consumer demand internationally as we launch into new markets. We now have approximately 200,000 people using the 670G system globally.","In addition, we experienced strong adoption of the Guardian Connect Smart CGM system, which grew in the high 80s. In RTG, we had another strong quarter, growing 4.6% as we successfully offset declines in our pain therapies business. Our brain business continues to deliver exceptional results, growing 11.4% with strength in both neurovascular and neurosurgery. In neurovascular, we grew in the mid-teens, our market leading share improving through the strong adoption of our recently launched Solitaire X stent retriever as well as our Riptide aspiration system and React catheters. In neurosurgery, our capital equipment sales continue to be robust. This is led by our Mazor X Stealth navigated robotic system, which not only is meaningfully outpacing the competition, but is also resulting in strong pull-through of our other market leading and differentiated capital equipment.","Sales of our StealthStation navigation system grew over 20% this quarter and our O-arm surgical imaging system grew close to 30%. In Q1, our organic spine revenue growth was the highest in nine quarters. In addition, when you combine our Spine division sales with the sales of our capital equipment from our brain therapies division used in spine surgery. Our spine division grew 4.7% with our U.S. Spine business growing at 6%. This is how our competitors report and it represents a strong indication that our strategy of offering our enabling capital equipment with our spine implants is working, as we are growing well above the spine market growth.","Now turning to emerging markets, which represents 16% of our revenue, we continue to drive strong growth in these markets as we optimize the distribution channel and in some markets localize R&D and manufacturing. In Q1 we grew, emerging markets 12% with strength coming from markets around the globe. China grew 11%, Eastern Europe 23% including 28% growth in Russia, and the Middle East and Africa grew 15%. In addition, South Asia grew 13%, Southeast Asia 12% and Latin America grew 9%. Our strategy of emerging market diversification around the world is working as evidenced by our consistent delivery of double-digit growth every quarter, overcoming economic cycles over the years in the different countries.","As a result of this quarter\u2019s outperformance and confidence in our outlook, we raised EPS guidance this morning, Q1 was clearly a good quarter, despite several headwinds and otherwise tough comparisons. As we look forward, we\u2019re even more excited about what lies ahead. As we expect the investments we\u2019ve made in our pipeline to begin to pay-off for the multiple pipeline catalysts, accelerating revenue growth and value creation for our shareholders. In CVG, upcoming launches include TAVR low risk indication, which we just received last week, our next generation Evolut PRO plus, TAVR valve and our DCB AV fistula indication. CVG also had several launches coming up in CRHF including the Reveal LINQ 2.0 and suitable cardiac monitor, the Diamond Temp ablation system in Europe and our Micra AV pacemaker. In MITG, we\u2019re excited to host Analysts and Hartford next month, at one of the world\u2019s leading robotic centers, where the analysts will experience a robotic assistant surgical procedure that is part of our development and clinical testing process using our soft tissue robotic system.","In RTG, we\u2019re launching the Midas Rex MR8 drill platform this quarter and continue to advance our Pelvic Health pipeline having started the regulatory approval process for InterStim II with MRI, recharge free system and our InterStim Micro with MRI, which is 3cc in volume and rechargeable. We expect to launch both of these products next spring. In addition, we have a next generation products In neurovascular and spinal cord stimulation, all of which are launching or preparing to launch in the next couple of quarters. In diabetes, we submitted our non-injunctive labeling application to the FDA and we are preparing for the launch of the MiniMed 780G, our advanced hybrid closed loop system with Bluetooth connectivity in the second half of this fiscal year. We\u2019re also making good progress on our pivotal trial for ZEUS. Our next generation iCGM Sensor that will reduce finger sticks by 95%.","There of course are several more product launches that we are preparing for across the company. I won\u2019t cover them all today. But I will say that we were making great progress across the portfolio and we keep you updated as we progress through this fiscal year, and I\u2019ll leave you with what I noted last quarter that we expect our growth rate to accelerate over the course of FY \u201820, with the second half going faster than the first, as we anniversary recent headwinds and bring multiple new products to market over the next several quarters. Moreover, we expect our top line momentum to build in FY \u201821 with each of our four groups having the potential to accelerate revenue growth next fiscal year, as we get the increasing benefit of the FY \u201820 product launches as well as the benefits from the products, slated to launch in FY \u201821.","Let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you. As Omar mentioned, we delivered first quarter revenue growth of 3.5% and adjusted EPS was $1.26, growing 7.7%, while we came in $0.08 above the midpoint of our guidance, it\u2019s worth noting that $0.02 resulted from better than expected FX, which at current rates we\u2019ll give back over the balance of the year. The other $0.06 was operational outperformance including better-than-expected revenue and operating margin expansion and a modest benefit from tax. Our adjusted operating margin was 28.2% reflecting improvement of 90 basis points with currency or 70 basis points constant currency. We delivered a very strong improvement in SG&A, as we continue to implement and drive efficiencies and improvements across the company under our enterprise excellence program.","In addition, we are seeing the benefits of the recent inclusion of operating margin as a component of our annual incentive plans across our groups and regions, which is driving increased focus on this important metric across the organization. In the first quarter, we successfully executed a \u20ac5 billion debt offering and use the proceeds to reduce U.S. dollar denominated debt. This followed a similar \u20ac7 billion transaction we executed in the fourth quarter. The combined \u20ac12 billion issuances carry a weighted average coupon of less than 1%. The result of the combined fourth and first quarter transactions is an annualized reduction to our net interest expense of over $300 million, a savings that will benefit Medtronic for years to come. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 15.1% lower than expected due to the increased benefits associated with the finalization of taxes owed on certain returns and changes in operational results by jurisdiction. Generating strong free cash flow remains a priority across the company. First quarter free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We continue to target an 80% conversion rate above our peer average over our long-range plan.","We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing investment in R&D and tuck-in acquisitions with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and net share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned over $800 million or 70% of the cash we generated, resulting in a total shareholder payout of 50% on adjusted net earnings. We also increased our dividend by 8% in June, making this our 42nd consecutive year, delivering a dividend increase. In fact, our dividend has grown by 77% over the past five years.","Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to update our annual revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the fiscal year, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%, while the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full year revenue growth of approximately 80 to 120 basis points.","Looking at annual organic growth by group, we now expect CVG to grow 2.5%, a 50 basis point increase from our prior expectation of 2% plus or minus. For RTG, we continue to expect growth of 4% to 4.5%; and for diabetes, we are comfortable at the lower end of our 6% to 8% range. Finally for MITG, we now expect growth of 5%, an increase versus our prior expectation of 4.5% to 5%. We expect our second quarter organic revenue growth to look similar to the first quarter with currency having a negative impact of 70 to 130 basis points at recent rates. By group, we expect organic growth in CVG and RTG to look similar to the first quarter for diabetes to grow low single digits as we await new product launches and for MITG growth to accelerate to 5.5% to 5.75% driven by new products. And as I noted last quarter, we continue to expect our total company organic revenue growth to accelerate north of 4% in the second half of the fiscal year.","Turning to margins, we continue to expect operating margin expansion in the full fiscal year of approximately 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our enterprise excellence initiatives. For the second quarter, we would expect a more modest improvement in operating margin, offset by a slight currency headwind, as we invest ahead of multiple new product launches. Given our recent euro debt offerings that I mentioned earlier, we expect our non-GAAP interest expense to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to expect our adjusted nominal tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 16.5% per quarter for the remainder of the year, which when combined with our Q1 non-recurring benefit would imply an annual range of 15.8% to 16.2%. We remain focused on optimizing our underlying operating tax rate over time, as U.S. tax reform regulations are finalized.","With respect to earnings, we are increasing our fiscal year \u201820 EPS guidance to a range of $5.54 to $5.60, a $0.10 raise from the prior range of $5.44 to $5.50. This includes the negative $0.10 impact of currency at recent rates, with a slightly worth impact over the balance of the year offsetting a better than expected benefit in the first quarter. For the second quarter we expect EPS of $1.27 to $1.29, including a $0.02 currency headwind at recent rates.","Now, I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen and let\u2019s now move on to Q&A. In addition to Karen, our four group presidents Mike Coyle, Bob White, Geoff Martha and Hooman Hakami, are also here to answer your questions. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Great, thank you and good morning. Just wanted to first say congrats on a really strong quarter and see if I could get some commentary about two product areas. First on diabetes, noted that you were nicely in line this first quarter, but if switched the guidance to the low end of the range just curious if you can talk about that a little bit? And then the other part of question I had was just on the robotic focused Analyst Day for September 24, really looking forward to that day and getting all the details. But I was just wondering if in front of the day you would be willing to give us at least a little directional sense for just launch timelines in the U.S., is that more than a year away within a year? Thank you. Those are the only two questions I have.","Omar Ishrak","I will let Hooman and Bob comment a little bit. First of all on the diabetes, I know we sort of tone down the numbers a little bit, but that doesn\u2019t remove our excitement regarding the upcoming launches here. The advanced hybrid closely with Bluetooth connectivity, in particular towards the end of the fiscal year is one that we are zeroing in on and the clinical trials and so on are in progress. We have had more competitive pressure than we\u2019d like in the U.S. in the first quarter. So taking that into account, we decided to be prudent about what our guidance should be. But let\u2019s not take anything away from the product launches that we\u2019re anticipating in the second half, those are on time and we will see what the result in, but we are pretty excited about them. I don\u2019t know Hooman if you want to add anything to that or?","Hooman Hakami","Sure, Bob. Thanks for the question. Maybe first a little bit of color on the dynamics that drove Q1 and that I think also sort of drive the guidance. If you recall from ADA the quarter was pretty much in line with what we talked about at ADA. We anticipated strong o-U.S. growth check, we \u2013 in the U.S., we expected consistent consumables in CGM revenue from the installed base, check. We said that we expected to renew our patients coming out of warranty in line with historical rates. We were able to do that and then we said the most volatile thing was really the conversions in the U.S. of patients coming from MDI. And that also sort of factored in. We\u2019re able to balance all of that and deliver in Q1. Now as far as the rest of the year goes it\u2019s largely as Omar stated, it\u2019s a function of the pipeline, which remains on track versus what we discussed at ADA. Now in Q2, we did expect to get some reimbursement for 670 in Germany. And we were hoping that, that would be an incremental contributor to offset some of the U.S. pressure that was discussed. But we are now assuming, we don\u2019t get this and we will get it next quarter, so for all of the reasons mentioned. This is why we are maintaining the range what leaning towards the lower end of the range.","Omar Ishrak","Bob?","Bob White","Yes, sure. Bob thanks for the question regarding the robot, we are excited as Omar mentioned to heavy investment community experience a preclinical validation lab in Hartford next month. And the reason we are doing it there is certainly part of our pre-clinical testing and experience and it\u2019s actually, you get to see it in action versus just on a state. So it\u2019s really important event as we continue to gather preclinical data and experience on our system. And in addition, during the day, there will be panels with us Medtronic\u2019s executive management will have some expert surgeons there as well and I know that Ryan sent to save the date out recently \u2013 save the date out recently and the invite will be coming from Ryan over the next couple of weeks. But as respect to your question Bob, we\u2019ve not changed our commitment on our launch timelines to launch the product, again, you specifically asked about the US, but of course we\u2019re going to launch outside the U.S. in FY \u201820. This is a team that continues to hit its milestones. We\u2019re excited about the program and we look \u2013 we are looking forward to seeing you next month.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just two from me one for Karen and one for Geoff. Karen, Karen, just thinking about the guidance in the second quarter I think last quarter you suggested 4% growth for the second quarter, now you\u2019re sort of suggesting something closer to 3.5%. So is the relative change simply diabetes and you still need some momentum improvement frankly sequentially to get to that number and what drives that confidence? And then just for Geoff. Just on surgical robotics, I\u2019m sorry, on spinal robotics, you definitely saw a significant change in relative growth versus market sequentially. So things definitely improved in the Core Spine business. Just kind of \u2013 can you grow above market in Core Spine this year and if you could give us the Mazor or system placement number in the quarter that would be great? Thanks so much.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, good morning, David. Thanks for the questions. In terms of 2Q excited about the growth acceleration that we intend to drive in the second half. In 2Q, we\u2019re seeing some U.S. softness in diabetes that we talked about and we\u2019re seeing some pain market issues, but beyond that, we are very excited about the acceleration that we\u2019re going to drive and it\u2019s just the first quarter. So we are working on delivering as we move through the year.","Geoffrey Martha","Hey, Dave, it\u2019s Geoff. So regarding the Spine question, yes, we\u2019re definitely seeing strong momentum Mazor has been a huge addition to our Surgical Synergy strategy and it\u2019s help \u2013 it\u2019s having a pretty significant network effect. I\u2019ll call within RTG, one as you pointed out on the implant side and can we grow above the market. But we are expecting to grow above the market here. We think that the whole enabling technology and robotic strategy that\u2019s where the market is going, it\u2019s going to cause the market to consolidate around a few players and we intend to lead that and take share now and going forward. As for the other impact that by the way that the robotics \u2013 Mazor is having is on the rest of our capital equipment portfolio which it\u2019s not something I completely expected. I mean our still our standalone stealth for spine and neurosurgery as well as our O-arm both grow over 20%, O-arm actually grew close to 30%. These are the products that have been in the market for a while and I think this is the impact of having a larger capital sales force and a lot of excitement around these products. So \u2013 and as for the placement in a number of unit sales, I guess, I have been told that I mean maybe given too much information in the last few quarters on this topic. So I am pretty excited about it maybe, got a little, but I can just tell you at this point, we are doing really well. I think others we would that we are doing really well above our expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. Karen, maybe we could start with a question on the P&L. This is the first time SG&A has been down year-over-year since first quarter 2017 you mentioned the operational excellence program. What exactly is driving the declines and how sustainable are they?","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for that question, Robbie. Yes, we were pleased with our SG&A performance, which clearly drove our operating margin expansion of 70 basis points on a constant currency basis. And on SG&A, we are very focused on driving enterprise excellence programs to drive further leverage and efficiency. We also introduced at the beginning of this year an incentive comp metric down into the organization on operating margin and I think that metric is also helping to drive good cost control well down into the organization.","Robbie Marcus","Okay. And then on the guidance or the balance of the year, you had a nice beat on the top line in the first quarter, you have a number of product launches hitting towards the back end of the year. Can you help us just maybe with cadence for the balance of the year, how you\u2019re thinking about the 4%? How conservative is that number still given you only added first quarter here and some of the big product launches and how we should think about those impacts to the top line? I appreciate that.","Karen Parkhill","Yes. Well thanks for that question too. So look, we just finished our first quarter and we had a strong first quarter. And we\u2019re really excited about the acceleration that we\u2019re going to drive in revenue growth throughout the year, particularly in the back half, that growth is really focused on strong product launches and the exact timing of approval and launch It\u2019s hard to predict, but we\u2019re excited about launching those in the back half that will drive the acceleration. At this stage that back half is going to have to be decent amount higher than we had in the first half to end the year at 4% and we\u2019re excited about that.","Omar Ishrak","So let me just also emphasize, Robbie, look we laid the formula out, we had a good first quarter. The second quarter, we actually have the advantage of some of these comparisons being better in Services and Solutions in the LVAD and other areas. And so there is some growth there as well. In terms of product launches, everything that we said is still completely in line and they\u2019re coming through. We just got the lowest TAVR approval. That is something that we were expecting actually a little later, we got a little earlier, so all the other programs are completely in line. We\u2019re very excited about them. But it\u2019s only the first quarter, so we want to guide what we guided at the beginning of the year, but look there\u2019s no hesitation in our part about the quality of these launches, when they\u2019re coming out, how excited we are about them, so that there may be no sort of confusion about that at all, and just take it in the context of this just the first quarter.","Robbie Marcus","Very clear, Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Robbie. Next question please, Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Yes, no, I am on. Congrats on a really nice sprint here. Just two quick ones on the guidance here, Karen, if you step back to the early part of this year, a lot of confusion around tax regulations, EPS headwinds and I think you guys were very clear about LRP not changing, correct? With the guidance raise this morning, at the high-end, we\u2019re looking at 7% plus on the EPS. Did you say \u2013 can you walk us through what the implications is? Because is the LRP going up because the execution is coming in better for this year? And as a follow up, I think our tax rates we were expecting some clarification in June, July time frame. Any clarity on what the tax rates readout and implications for the medium term? Thank you.","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for the question, Vijay. Our long-range guidance on the bottom line is 8%-plus over the long range time frame and that has not changed and will not change. Yes, in terms of the new guidance on EPS, largely driven by the beat we had this quarter and our ability to lower our interest expense which helps to offset that tax rate increase. Our guide is above 7% on a constant currency basis on an actual basis for EPS on the high end. In terms of whether or not this year over the long range plan we\u2019ll get to the 8%, we\u2019ll see. But we\u2019re confident in our guidance right now. And on tax regs, certain regulations have been finalized. There are numerous regulations to still be finalized. We do anticipate all of the regulations to hopefully be final prior to the end of our fiscal year. We will continue to focus on opportunities to optimize our tax rate. And where the regs are final, we are beginning to take action to optimize. But I would say, it\u2019s very early and too early to tell what our tax rate will be on the long-term basis going forward. In the meantime, we expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be in that range of 16% to 16.5%. We did have some favorability in the first quarter by some non-recurring items, and so that helps drive our year tax rate to what we guided to about 15.8% to 16.2%. Hope that\u2019s helpful.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys. Yes. Very helpful. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. A couple of product specific questions. First, on Pain Stim, can you quantify the inventory destocking you saw there and where do you think that process will be played out in 2Q \u2013 or in 1Q or will continue to be a drag?","Omar Ishrak","Go Geoff.","Geoffrey Martha","Yes, sure. I am not going to quantify specifically. But yeah, we had a really strong Q4, first of all, and that contributed to some of this and the market slowdown also contributed to it. So I don\u2019t think the destocking will be a continued drag. The market slowdown is obviously, I think, caught the severity of it, it caught us and our competitors a little bit by surprise, and that to me is the bigger issue.","Chris Pasquale","And then on the DCB front, can you just update us on the expectations for your franchise going forward? Do you think utilization has bottomed now post the physician communication? And if use is limited to high risk patients, what does that mean for the growth potential of the business going forward? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Mike, go ahead.","Michael Coyle","So back in March when the original FDA notification went out where they basically were saying, for most patients the risk would outweigh the benefits, we saw a fairly significant contraction. It was about a 50% reduction in U.S. volumes versus what they had been before, and on a global basis, within the \u2013 in the low 40s. Obviously, as we came out of the panel meeting, there was a lot more data that was presented, updates on patient follow-up where we got to almost 95% follow up on our patient base, which improved the safety profile of the devices, and then some very significant incremental data was presented from claims based analysis and very large data sets that basically showed that \u2013 the second went away in these large numbers. And so we were very encouraged by what we viewed as incrementally constructive FDA notification here that basically said that for a certain high-risk patients who are at risk for reintervention, that, in fact, the benefits of DCB technology outweighed the risks. And so we have now seen instead of the reduction that we had indicated something more like a 40% US reduction, low 40s, and on a global basis, that\u2019s down into the low 30s reduction. So we think it\u2019s stabilized. It\u2019s actually improving since those data were put out. And we think as more data becomes available, this is going to shift from a discussion of class effect to basically individual performance of the individual products. I mean we are very encouraged by that because we have a very significant randomized controlled data sets in the U.S., FDA support for FFA for the Japan study we have our global registry data as well as some new data sets that are going to be released in other indications. So our AV fistula indication is going to be \u2013 the data is going to be presented at the upcoming CIRSE meeting next month and we are very encouraged that the more data that is coming out, it\u2019s basically focusing on the efficacy of these products and also showing that the signal that was a concern as more data becomes available is becoming less of a concern. And so we expect there to be an improvement, but obviously we need to see return to growth until we get to the second half of the fourth quarter.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Chris. Take the next question please, Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on TAVR if I could. So you mentioned there\u2019s been a couple of developments recently about the low risk approval and the NCD. So I guess on those fronts, on the low risk approval, I\u2019m curious what your expectations are for that will do to market growth? And secondly, for the NCD, you did mention you\u2019re in negotiations with a number of the new centers now that are looking to come online. And I\u2019m just curious upon what basis those negotiations are going. Has there been any discussion of price or anything in terms of how those centers are choosing that they are going to with here in terms of their TAVR programs?","Omar Ishrak","Mike?","Michael Coyle","So we would estimate if you \u2013 by customer indication which we expect will be an area focus with additional data availability that the low-risk patient population basically expands the available market by about 50%. And so that, with the addition of the NCD where we expect to see approximately another 200 centers come online, it obviously is going to give an opportunity for an acceleration of growth from where it was, let\u2019s say, last quarter which was for us around 12% up into the mid-teens and maybe a little bit higher than that, and that basically is really being supported by these new indications for use. And in terms of the basis of negotiations with the NDT sites, they are really no different than what we have had with a pre-existing sites in terms of the compelling clinical evidence around these products basically makes any center that wants to be a full-service aortic valve center, they need to be able to do both surgery as well as transcatheter valves. And as a result, this is more about training and education and getting them up to speed on optimal techniques for use of these products, and that\u2019s exactly what we are focused on.","Raj Denhoy","Great, thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Raj. Next question please, Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning, everybody and very nice quarter. A number of new products that are launching over the next 12 to 18 months, can you please give us a highlight of which ones are you the most excited about? And also, on the same vein, you have got two major medical meetings coming up with NASS and TCT. What should we expect to see there, and will any of those new products be there? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. I am going to take that. Thanks, Joanne. First, like you point out, there\u2019s a number of new products coming out and there\u2019s many, but I\u2019m going to go through a few of these that I think are the most exciting. First of all, a general surgery robotic system, which you\u2019ll see live and in person in September 24 and I promise you that will be an exciting and eventual event for you, so we\u2019re excited about that. Now beyond that, the micro AV, look, we\u2019ve got 80% share in the single-chamber market, covering only 15% of the pacemaker population, that\u2019s growing up to 55% of the population. And I\u2019m not going to pre to 80% share, but that\u2019s at least what I expect. So that\u2019s a product I\u2019m really excited about. The LINQ 2.0 which is a second-generation diagnostic device. It has got a 5-year battery life. The Evolut PRO plus which is now coming in the heels of the low rick TAVR approval. The diabetes 780G minimum, the MiniMed 780G, that\u2019s got Bluetooth connectivity, it\u2019s a hybrid advanced hybrid closed-loop system, it\u2019s a second-generation of the closed loop, based on our experience and the database that we have on patients already. The InterStim Micro which is rechargeable device 3cc in volume for Pelvic Health which we\u2019re expecting approval in the second half, the Diamond AF ablation catheter which has got temperature sensing, which is some unique technology which we launch in Europe in second half. And then there is the percept DBS System 2, which has sensing capability the first time in this kind of a system and a great platform for the first time closed-loop system in DBS. Now in addition to these launches, like you mentioned, some of these meetings in \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to sort of share some data as well. The US pivotal trial results for the impact AV fistula access program for dialysis patients, that\u2019s one we\u2019re going to share. The Symplicity renal denervation program, we expect some exciting results out of that and the data from that we share. The diamond AF ablation catheter I just mentioned that, that\u2019s a leapfrog technology because of temperature sensing like I mentioned. We launch that in Europe but will share data on that in the upcoming meetings here and then finally the diabetes system will also expect to complete enrollment of the patients for the next few weeks. Specifics to those two specific events, Mike, do you have any comments?","Michael Coyle","Well, as it relates to TCT, that\u2019s a little bit sooner than some of these data sets are going to be available, so I think I would steer you more toward meetings later in the year and into early next year so we will \u2013 around the AHA time we\u2019ll be talking about the MARVEL 2 data, which is the Micra AV performance. And then as we get into next year as we look at the ACC, we would expect to be able to present the offmed components of the Symplicity Spyral study. And also, as Omar mentioned, between here and there, we will also have the impact Admiral ADF data. So there should be very meaningful data sets coming, but they\u2019re more going to be later in the year and into next year.","Omar Ishrak","And then NASS?","Michael Coyle","So NASS, we all claimed talk to you guys about a number of things. First, in core spine, we have a number of launches, probably the biggest of which this year is corpectomy device this T2 stratosphere. We\u2019ve got single position and then, of course, the type which we just closed. Integration is going very well. And we\u2019ll walk you through how that\u2019s going to impact our overall portfolio. But I\u2019d say think of Titan as a surface technology platform that can apply to our existing broad-based spine portfolio. We\u2019ll also talk more about Surgical Synergy and robotics, as I mentioned earlier, and how that rollout is going. And our road map for new features that we are going to be adding to the enabling technology specifically kind of all enabling technologies, specifically robotics because we do have a very specific road map that goes up over the next two weeks few years, all meant to basically drive procedural improvement both from a health economic standpoint and the clinical outcome standpoint. And then finally, Biologics, we have a General Manager we put in charge of our Biologics business about year and a half ago and he\u2019s really done a good job in investing not only in infuse, but our broader bio portfolio, which we can talk to you more about that which I think is kind of underrated right now. It\u2019s actually helping drive some of our growth. And then finally, one thing that\u2019s not NASS related and I think Omar ran out of breath before he got to, we did on Pain Stim, we did we have a new next-generation Telus device, which we haven\u2019t spoken about before, that we can talk about later in the year at NANS. So, this gets back to not NASS, but obviously the broader product launches we are excited about. We haven\u2019t really talked about this and so at the NANS this year we\u2019ll be talking about that as well as some new stem pattern work we\u2019ve been doing and then, of course, our 12-month vectors data will be talking about at NANS as well, because I think this paint stim market as super sensitive to innovation and then where the market a little bit of innovation law versus where we were in the past 18 months and I think it\u2019s going to be launches like this will get that market going again.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you so much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Joanne. Next question please, Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a good quarter. Not surprised for Omar\u2019s ability to speak without stopping given he\u2019s climbed Kilimanjaro. So just want to just circle back on the product front, two kind of product categories I just want to dive a little bit deeper into. So, on the InterStim Micro side, you had mentioned that that\u2019s FY \u201820, and I think you\u2019d also mentioned I guess a rechargeable version. I just want to clarify that I understand that product a little bit more. Is that going to be a smaller device? And what\u2019s kind of just the confidence around getting both of those products out in FY \u201820? And then I have one follow-up.","Omar Ishrak","First, it is rechargeable and it\u2019s 3cc, so it is more but Geoff, you can add some...","Geoffrey Martha","Yes, I think we began, Kristen, on the regulatory process the current InterStim II device the primary self by adding MRI capabilities to that, but the bigger one will be obviously the rechargeable device as Omar mentioned, is very small. This we are anticipating happening the initial launch in Europe in the spring and a little later in the U.S., but so when you say FY \u201820 in Europe and then U.S. would be late FY \u201820 or early FY \u201821. And because we\u2019re submitting a PMA supplement, we don\u2019t think we need to a separate clinical trial and we\u2019ve been talking about this with the FDA to confirm our thinking. So, we\u2019re really excited about this and the features the combination of our smaller size, I\u2019m talking about rechargeable the micro, the smaller size, the 3cc, the overdrive battery technology and the MRI capability, it really is advantage is a big advantage for us no matter what the competition is saying on this. Yes, this is the same technology combo platter that\u2019s powering Intellis, whose performance has surprised many of us and propelled us back to leadership in FCF.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then the other device was just the same size InterStim today, but just MRI safe version?","Geoffrey Martha","Exactly. One of the things that I think is important is that and I think people are starting to realize this, but rechargeable is not meant for every patient. So, having both a primary cell and a rechargeable, on a very small rechargeable I think is going to cover will cover a much broader spectrum of patients than just the rechargeable.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, perfect. And then just broadly I guess with micro AV, about seems to be the more significant launch you guys or I guess Omar you were just saying that you were hoping that you could see I guess an 80% share in that market category as well. How are you just feeling about bringing that to market? And then also maybe just talk about the extravascular ICD as well and just kind of the timelines there. I think you were supposed to be starting or did start your pivotal studies with that product. Thanks a lot.","Omar Ishrak","Without being biased towards one thing, I will tell you that this is the one product that I\u2019m certainly most excited about because of the if nothing else is symbolism that the Medtronic was started as a company which invented the pacemaker market and here we are 60 years later disrupting that market with the device that is way ahead of any competition and the 80% share is actual fact and the 15% will be cover. So, an expectation that, that kind of share trend should continue over time is quite realistic. But I\u2019ll let Mike add some more color to this.","Michael Coyle","Well, remember, there are two aspects to this. One is obviously the procedural penetration and then there\u2019s also the price increase that we get over the device which is essentially in the single-chamber market is about 3 times the prevailing pricing in the standard device system. So, the reason you see a procedural share, including our traditional single-chamber system in around 65% range and then having an 80% revenue share is because of that step up in price. Now as we move into the Micra AV, we basically have been to date really confined to patients who needed ventricular pacing who also had atrial defibrillation. Now any patients with AV block in conduction in the normal rhythm in the atrium becomes a candidate for this device. And so, the available market goes from 15% up to 55%, 60%. And so that\u2019s why we view it as a big opportunity to drive share and then the real benefits of this technology are even though pacemakers are relatively safe for implant, almost all the complications come from each of the either the pocket of the lead and so by being able to put a device directly into the heart and having a 10 to 12 year battery life, this really offers significant clinical advantages to patients, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited about it.","Kristen Stewart","EV-ICDs.","Michael Coyle","And EV-ICD, we will be are beginning the pivotal trial associated with that, we haven\u2019t talked a while about that trial design, but it is getting underway now.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Kristen. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matt Taylor","Good morning, Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start with the quick follow-up on the AV question. So, Mike or Omar, is there anything different about AV versus single-chamber in terms of the speed of the launch? I mean you have people trained on single-chamber now. You have reimbursement in place. Could this uptick actually be faster than single-chamber?","Omar Ishrak","Well, I\u2019ll let Mike answer that. I think it is a new concept though, so that requires some buy in maybe. I don\u2019t know, Mike...","Michael Coyle","On the one hand, the procedural aspects are very similar, almost identical to the single-chamber device. And of course, as you point out, we\u2019ve done the training associated with this. But there are number of physicians who basically said, they don\u2019t do enough single chamber devices to make worth their time to do training, now we get this device and we\u2019re going to see more physicians coming on stream who want to learn the technique, which is going to be helpful for us not just in this new indication for use, but even in the traditional single-chamber pacing. So that will be helpful. There are some aspects of their patient follow-up that are different and we\u2019re going to be spending as we did with the initial launch a lot of time making sure that the physicians are trained and what to look for both on the implant procedure and in the discharge process. And so we are going to be very careful in terms of rolling out updated training even to those who have been trained before. But to your point, I think it should have a marginally faster adoption rate than what we saw with single-chamber.","Matt Taylor","Okay, thanks. And just on surgical robotics, I was hoping you could maybe talk about the strategy as it relates to Mazor and how that informs what you might do with the soft tissue surgical robot. And are you thinking about using robotics anywhere else?","Hooman Hakami","You want me to take the first one. Look it\u2019s a great question. The work that Geoff and his team has done with Mazor absolutely is influencing how we think about our commercialization approach with the soft tissue robot. As Omar has mentioned many times in the past, Medtronics uniquely positioned with high-value consumables and if you think about our leading position with the end effectors in the surgery space and that trusted brand that we have with surgeons, the ability to pair those instruments with our robot is incredibly important. And of course, we\u2019ve been training surgeons on surgery for over 60 years and we\u2019ve pioneered innovations in that space. And so, when we look at what Geoff and team have done with RTG from a service capability, from a commercial model capability, I think we are very much aligned to learn from that piece.","Geoffrey Martha","Yes. Let me also add answer the question regarding other areas. Let me tell you that in virtually every area that we have a procedural presence, we will look at robotics because that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be. And we\u2019re learning from our current experience, but I can tell you that the data analytics capability, we\u2019re just beginning to evolve. Combination with the robot with other capital equipment, especially ones with visualization and for navigation, that we\u2019re showing with Mazor is not only restricted to spine along. Planning procedures, planning the procedure upfront and then using that to guide the robot in specific ways, that\u2019s a core capability that we\u2019ve that we\u2019re starting to develop with Mazor, but we\u2019ll translate across into surgical robot at sometime in the future, the procedure is different. There are some core areas where we are learning which we will apply to virtually every area that we\u2019ve got procedures. And I can tell you it\u2019s a big area of focus for us, both organically as well as inorganically. And one that we expect over the long-term, not just in one procedure, because across all procedures, and be the company who rewrites the way surgery is done in the next decade. So, make no mistake, this is a core area for us and we\u2019ll see much more of about robots than just the two that you\u2019re looking at today in the future.","Omar Ishrak","One area though short-term that we are moving into would be other cranial procedures, so we have the Mazor Renaissance, which is indicated for cranial procedures. In Medtronic, we\u2019re launching another cranial, a smaller cranial robot. And these robots will be used for lead placement, for example, and deep brain stimulation procedures, EEG placement for epilepsy as well as tumor resection, so tumor resection itself. So those are two different robots applied to various cranial procedures, brain procedures as well.","Matt Taylor","Thanks for all the color.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Matt. Next question please, Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matt Miksic","Thanks for taking the question. So, I had just a couple of product-related follow-ups. The first for Mike on, TYRX the antibacterial product for CRM. The rapid results obviously didn\u2019t get the same attention that low risk TAVR did at ACC, and yet this could be over time another potential share gainer for this business, and just wondering Mike if you could give us an update on what\u2019s been happening since the data was presented, what kind of response have you gotten? Maybe what are the next steps and drivers we can look at over the next 12 months or so? And then I had a follow-up for Geoff.","Michael Coyle","So, we\u2019ve been very pleased with TYRX performance since the ACC presentation, the rapid data. We have seen meaningful acceleration of its adoption as a result of those data. This past quarter, we were mid-30s growth for the product. As you point out, it not only helps us in terms of revenue per procedure. And we view the at-risk patient population to represent a little over half of the patients because it applies to essentially large devices, so ICD, CRT devices, in initial procedures as well as all replacements, including pacemaker replacements. And so, as a result, it\u2019s helping us not only in terms of our overall revenue share, but we actually are seeing in the high-risk patients then selecting Medtronic because they want these TYRX product and that\u2019s helping us with initial implant share across our portfolio, especially on High Power and on the CRT side of things.","Matt Miksic","And then in terms of guidelines or things that may for over the next 12 months or so?","Michael Coyle","Well, we are working with the data sets and the professional societies to see if we can get this into indications for use. We also are expanding application of the envelope to other parts of the Medtronic business, including the neurostimulation devices, both for the brain, as well as for pain as well as for Pelvic Health.","And so, it\u2019s helping us in both regards. I\u2019m not yet ready address timing of any indication or guidelines to the expansion, but we are working on that.","Omar Ishrak","Let me add that the TYRX is a core technology that we\u2019ve essentially developed. And while that in itself is one thing, what it pulls along with it in terms of our devices is something that will become a true differentiator for Medtronic in the long term. And we\u2019re investing in that area to make sure that we can sort of broaden the usage of TYRX over time. So that\u2019s a key technology area of focus for us which we think we\u2019re well differentiated.","Michael Coyle","It also has helped us immensely in our value-based health care programs from the standpoint that having performance guarantees is something that our customer base really is looking to as us having skin in the game as they shift to that risk sort of arrangements with payers. And we now have over $1 billion in revenue associated with essentially performance guaranteed programs and $800 million of that is tied to TYRX.","Matt Miksic","And then over Geoff, if I could, on spine and pain. So, spine implant growth over 2% in the U.S. and 2% worldwide. That does look like it\u2019s ahead of market growth to me at this point. Geoff, if you could maybe just provide a little bit of color? Obviously, you\u2019re happy with the placements in the quarter, but maybe a color as to how the pull-through dynamics work on the systems you placed over the last few quarters? And on pain, I know you\u2019d mentioned during your prepared remarks, it\u2019s still kind of a softer market or a tough market to sort of project. Maybe some sense of when that settles down, we get a better sense of spinal cord stimulation and what that markets really growing at? Thanks.","Geoffrey Martha","Sure, Matt. So, I\u2019ll take the spinal one first. So, to kind of break it down, I mean we\u2019ve talked about the use of spine robotics and the linkage with our implants and how as the utilization of Mazor goes up, we\u2019ll get more pull-through. And we\u2019re in the early, early stages of that. So, we\u2019re getting, if you\u2019re looking at three kind of metrics on that, we\u2019re getting the robot sales, that\u2019s kind of the socket race. So, we\u2019re doing very well there, as indicated. And when they use Mazor, our customers are using Medtronic and that attachment rate is close to 70% and that\u2019s going to go higher as we get more of the Mazor X Stealth addition out there where the navigation is into Mazor. Remember when we talk about placements also, we\u2019ve got a much Mazors out there that we\u2019re upgrading to Stealth addition. So, our attachment is really strong.","And so, what we\u2019re really driving here is the utilization, that involves a lot of training and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve got all kinds of demo labs and training labs at different customers. And we\u2019ve built up a whole new 100-person component of our sales force that\u2019s like a SWAT team that goes into these accounts and works with the surgeons, with our team, the surgical staff and I guess our reps to train everybody and get them comfortable doing robotic procedures. So, we\u2019re in the early innings of that, and as that increases, you\u2019re going to get more pull-through. But what we\u2019re seeing now is that these robots are getting into the competitive accounts where and giving us something to engage on with surgeons, and the C-suite, quite frankly, are very engaged in this for a variety of reasons. And we\u2019re using this to get into competitive accounts and once we are in there and we walk in with our broad or our good service, our broad portfolio, which now includes Titan, that\u2019s having a more immediate impact.","So, if there\u2019s an initial impact as we get into competitive accounts and then there\u2019s a longer-term impact as we drive utilization. So, I guess that this strategy has a long runway ahead of it and we\u2019re in the very early stages and we\u2019re already seeing impact. For spinal cord stimulation, look, I\u2019m kind of like a little embarrassed for industry our competitors and ourselves don\u2019t have a more specific answer as to what is driving in the short term. But look, I think tell you, I think this is a very innovation sensitive market and we had a lot of innovation come out in a pretty condensed period of time from us and our competitors. And now it\u2019s come down a little bit. And then seeing that, we\u2019ve made some trade-offs in RTG and have accelerated our spinal cord stimulation and prioritized our spinal cord stimulation pipeline. So, like I said, we\u2019ve accelerated the next generation Intellis into this fiscal year. And I don\u2019t want to get in too much of the features, I\u2019m going to talk about that at NASS, what that means but it is a next-generation device.","Behind that, we have a and the next year behind that, a new primary cell device coming out, which like I said, in Pelvic Health, same applies for spinal cord stimulation. You need a broader set of both rechargeable and primary cell devices. And then in addition to that, we\u2019re working on closed-loop for spinal cord stimulation. We have a very active program on closed-loop or you may have heard it\u2019s called e-caps out in the market space. So, we\u2019ve got that coming as well. That\u2019s a little further out, but we\u2019ve got a pretty robust pipeline that we\u2019ll have a pretty regular cadence and I think that\u2019s going to drive the market. I do think this market should be a high single-digit grower based on all the demographics as well as the opioid crisis here in the U.S. and a few other markets.","Matt Miksic","Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Matt. We\u2019ll take the last question, please, Regina.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks, so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really solid quarter. Karen, I wanted to follow-up on the question Robbie has regarding SG&A. And it does feel like that you are seeing benefits from including operating margin as a component of the annual incentive plan. Just wonder if you can parse out exactly where you are in rolling out that process across the organization and if you can quantify where you are relative to where you expect to be at longer term as it relates to that and parse out how much that\u2019s contributing to this quarter\u2019s operating margin expansion versus some other dynamics, i.e., the product pipeline or improving product mix? And that\u2019s all I have. Thanks so much.","Karen Parkhill","Sure. Thanks, Danielle. We introduced operating within incentive comp at the total company level last fiscal year. And then this fiscal year, we drove it down into the organization. It\u2019s hard to parse out the benefits of that, but I would say we do have a strong cost control around the company that started last fiscal year and has continued into this fiscal year. But we\u2019re also purposely driving greater efficiencies across the company as we work to leverage our size and scale in our back offices and our customer service centers and across our enabling functions. And those programs are all driven as part of enterprise excellence, and we\u2019re clearly seeing the results. We are tracking the savings. And you\u2019re seeing it now show up in our margin expansion.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Danielle. Okay. So, let me close it out. First, thanks for your questions before I completely close it out, I\u2019ll just a couple of more sentences. We talked a lot about our product pipeline today, but let me just remind you that almost everything we talked about is actually in the second half of FY \u201820. This momentum is not going to stop going into FY \u201821. And as was noted earlier, if I had more breath I could probably continue until we\u2019ve launch in FY \u201821, I\u2019m not going to stop. And I really mean it and we all mean it when we say that, today, we have the strongest and the broadest pipeline that we\u2019ve ever had in our history. And you\u2019ll see that thing play out in the upcoming quarters. So, it\u2019s with great excitement that I really want to close this call out. And on behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for your continued support, your interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q2 earnings call which we\u2019ll be holding on Tuesday, November the 19th. So, thank you all very much for your interest. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call.

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's First Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to hand the program over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead.","Jeff Warren","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's First Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2013 first quarter, which ended July 27, 2012. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-business summary.","Should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors' portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.","With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar S. Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $4 billion, which represents growth of 5%. Q1 non-GAAP earnings of $883 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.85 increased 4% and 8%, respectively. It is worth pointing out that we delivered these results while covering $0.01 or $0.02 of negative EPS impact from bad debt of a Greek distributor and higher-than-expected tax expense. Gary will discuss these items later.","Our Q1 results represent another positive step toward our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth. Two of our larger end markets, U.S. ICD and U.S. Spine, which have been under pressure, continue to show signs of stabilization. At the same time, our results reflect the positive operational impact of our strategies and market-leading technologies, both in developed and emerging markets. There is still a lot of work to be done, and we're just at the beginning of our efforts. But we're encouraged that our actions and improving execution are beginning to yield some results.","Let me start with the U.S. ICDs. We estimate the market declined approximately 4%, the best it has been in 6 quarters. While the market did see the normal impact of our Q4 to Q1 seasonality, we were pleased to see relative sequential stability. Our U.S. ICD business was down 3% in Q1, slightly better than the market. Pricing was down around 4%, which was consistent with the previous quarter. Our implant volumes were up 4%, but this growth was offset by hospitals reducing their level of bulk purchases, which are now at the lowest level in nearly 5 years. This reduction in bulk purchases is a trend we have seen over the last 4 quarters. And looking ahead, we would expect the stabilization in the U.S. market to continue.","Turning to U.S. Spine. We estimate that U.S. Core Spine market was flat and has now modestly improved over the past 3 quarters. Stabilization was also evident in our own results as our U.S. Core Spine business was flat this quarter. Our business seems to be turning the corner as our new products and procedures gain critical mass. Our continued focus on navigated spinal procedures and enabling technologies, such as POWEREASE, is attracting more surgeon interest and improving our Spine financial results.","Strong capital equipment sales in our Surgical Technologies business further demonstrate the importance of these technologies. And as a result, our U.S. Core Spine share is stable year-over-year, and we estimate we gained modest share sequentially in Q1. Although we are pleased with the progress we are making, it is still very early, and we have to build on this momentum and deliver consistent results over time.","The other part of our U.S. Spine business, BMP, declined 20% in Q1. As you know, questions were raised at -- last year about INFUSE, and to better understand the facts, we requested Yale University to perform an unprecedented systematic analysis of all the available data. While the timing is controlled by Yale, we are expecting the result to be published in the coming months.","The remainder of our business also performed well with some standout performances in areas where new products are making a difference. In Coronary, our Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent picked up an additional 7 points of share in the U.S. this quarter, nearly tripling our share over the past 2 quarters.","In Endovascular, the launch of our Endurant abdominal aortic stent graft in Japan and the release of Endurant II in the U.S. and in Europe are driving strong growth in our aortic business. Across the balance of our CVG portfolio, we continue to see double-digit growth in transcatheter valves, in AF ablation and our peripheral interventional product lines.","In RTG, our recently launched RestoreSensor is gaining solid market acceptance and resulting in improved growth in Pain Stim. Additionally, we continue to see double-digit growth across the RTG portfolio, in DBS, Gastro, Uro, CGM, navigation and ENT.","While our teams are executing well on recent product launches, we are also making progress on advancing our industry-leading product pipeline. In transcatheter valves, we expect to complete enrollment in our CoreValve U.S. high-risk arm in the coming weeks. In renal denervation, we're continuing enrollment in our SYMPLICITY HTN-3 U.S. pivotal trial and remain on track to complete enrollment during the first calendar quarter of next year. We also continue to advance our drug-eluting balloon program as we enroll patients in our IN.PACT SFA II U.S. pivotal study.","While these are all longer-term programs, we also have important programs that we expect to launch in the next 12 months. In CRDM, we have received CE Mark approval for the Viva and Brava families of next-generation, high-power CRT-D products. In Spine, we anticipate U.S. approval later this fiscal year for our BRYAN ACD Cervical Disc, which we believe will take share in the growing cervical arthroplasty market. We also expect to launch new interbody implants from our AMT acquisition in the NASS conference in October. And finally, in Diabetes, we're targeting U.S. approval of our MiniMed 530G pump, as well as our Enlite Sensor late this fiscal year.","Our international revenue grew 6% in Q1, including 4% growth in Western Europe, which has remained relatively stable over the past several quarters. Our European growth varied by country with stronger growth in the north, including double-digit growth in France, the U.K. and Ireland, but partially offset by softness in Southern Europe. However, we are seeing signs that Southern Europe -- that the Southern European governments are focusing on ways to better support their healthcare systems. For example, in Spain and Italy, they both recently made some significant payments on the outstanding payables to us. While we're encouraged by these positive signs, we're obviously continuing to watch Europe very closely. Overall, our developed markets, including the U.S., showed improved growth this quarter, and our emerging markets grew 14%.","Although this performance in emerging markets is respectable, I was disappointed in that it was below the 20% level that we've been targeting and expect to deliver consistently over the longer term. As I mentioned in our investor meeting in June, we feel that emerging market growth, combined with market stabilization, as well as our strong portfolio and pipeline, provides the foundation to deliver consistent top and bottom line growth over the midterm. But over the longer term, we must position ourselves to succeed in the rapidly changing global healthcare market.","To do this, we're building upon our strength and remain focused in 2 main long-term strategies, creating economic value and accelerating globalization. As I continue to reach out to our customers around the world, I'm further convinced that these are the right strategies. These customer interactions also provide further clarity of the new kinds of partnerships needed to win in the changing healthcare environment. The ability to deliver economic value is increasingly important, especially in the U.S. and Europe, as the market clearly shifts from paper procedure to paper value. Likewise, with globalization, there's an increasing need to address inequity in access to healthcare for people around the world, particularly for our therapies.","In order to fully capitalize on these strategies, we are improving the operating rigor across the company. We remain focused on reducing product cost by $1.2 billion over the next 5 years. This is important not only to maintain our gross margins, but it also fuels innovation in tiered products, which are essential to our strategies for us succeeding in the emerging value segment. We are also focusing improving working capital, and I've set a goal for the company to meaningfully improve our inventory turns. In that regard, we recently adjusted our incentive programs to drive better inventory management. Improvements like this will strengthen our already robust levels of free cash flow generation.","And this leads me to my final point, our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, Medtronic has a long history of consistently increasing our dividend. And in June, our Board of Directors once again increased our dividend to a payout ratio of 30%. In fact, over the past 5 years, our dividend has more than doubled. We further supplement our shareholder return through share repurchases and have bought back 13% of our shares over the past 5 years. We feel the commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders is appropriate at this point, given our current mix of U.S.\/o U.S. free cash flow, and we believe that the remaining 50% of our free cash flow provides us with ample flexibility to make investments for sustainable growth.","With respect to M&A opportunities, I want to emphasize that we will be very disciplined. We do not intend to pass along EPS dilution to our shareholders, and all transactions will be scrutinized for their ability to meet our high financial hurdles with a particular focus on returns. This commitment is tied directly to the change we made this year in our long-term incentive plan, where return on invested capital now has much greater weight. We believe the combination of our strong capital allocation policies, together with executing on our near and midterm growth drivers and long-term strategies will enable us to create value for our shareholders.","Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take your questions. So, Gary?","Gary L. Ellis","Thanks, Omar. First quarter revenue of $4,008,000,000 increased 2% as reported and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $119 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q1 revenue results by region were as follows. Growth in Central and Eastern Europe is 21%. Greater China grew 15%. Growth in Middle East and Africa was 14%. South Asia grew 12%. Growth in Latin America was 11%. Western Europe and Canada grew 4%. And growth in U.S. was also 4%, while Asia Pacific grew 2%, including 1% growth in Japan. Emerging markets grew a combined 14% in Q1 and represented 11% of our total sales mix.","Q1 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $864,000,000 and $0.83, an increase of 5% and 8%, respectively. After adjusting for acquisition-related items and the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, first quarter earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were 888 -- $883 million and $0.85, an increase of 4% and 8% respectively.","In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2,115,000,000 grew 4%. Results were driven by solid growth in Coronary, Endovascular, AF Solutions and Structural Heart, partially offset by declines in Pacing.","CRDM revenue of $1,193,000,000 declined 2%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $675 million was flat, and we estimate that the worldwide ICD market declined in the low-single digits as we continue to see the U.S. ICD market stabilize. Our Protecta ICD, with its shock reduction and Lead Integrity Alert technologies, combined with the proven long-term performance of our Sprint Quattro leads, continues to receive strong market acceptance. In the U.S., our lead-to-port ratio has returned to the highest level since 2007, and we saw a marked improvement in ICD replacement market share. In Western Europe, our high-power share reached its highest levels in 3 years.","Pacing revenue of $463 million declined 6% in line with the market. Our U.S. Pacing revenues declined 10%, also in line with the market. These declines were driven primarily by pricing, which was down in the mid-single digits as we have now anniversaried the market release of the Revo MRI pacemaker family and, to a lesser extent, fewer procedures and reduced hospital bulk purchases.","Our AF Solutions business grew nearly 20% globally with growth in excess of 30% in the U.S., driven by the strong performance of our Arctic Front cryoballoon as we continue to gain share in this important growth market. In Q2, we plan to launch our Arctic Front Advance, with its EvenCool technology, in centers in U.S. and Europe.","Coronary revenue of $433 million grew 16% on the global strength of Resolute Integrity. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $253 million, including $102 million in the U.S. Resolute Integrity's deliverability, unique diabetes indication [ph] and long-term clinical performance is receiving a strong customer acceptance globally. The rapid capture of DES market share in the U.S. clearly demonstrates the benefits of our broader CVG sales and customer support strategy.","It also reinforces our expanding leadership position within the interventional cardiology community, which will continue to expand as we bring forward fundamental new technologies -- new therapies, excuse me, such as transcatheter valves and renal denervation. Next month, we expect to launch Resolute Integrity into the $500 million Japanese DES market. As with the U.S. market, we intend, at a minimum, to double our share.","In renal denervation, we continue to lay the groundwork for this important opportunity. Commercially, we are still on the pre-reimbursement phase in many countries, and SYMPLICITY is fighting for discretionary spending in European hospitals that are faced with tightening budgets. Achieving broader reimbursement is going to require more robust clinical data, which we are actively pursuing with both our HTN-3 U.S. pivotal study and our global SYMPLICITY registry.","Turning to Structural Heart. Revenue of $280 million increased 7%, driven by strong growth in TAVI. We continue to innovate in this space, leading in the introduction of new sizes and in indications. We launched our CoreValve Evolut 23-millimeter valve in Europe late in Q1. With Evolut, we are now able to serve the broadest range of TAVI patients upon a common 18 French delivery system.","On the clinical front, we have a full portfolio of clinical trials designed to drive regulatory approval and therapy expansion. We have begun enrollment of our global CoreValve SURTAVI trial, focused on expanding the market to moderate-risk patients. In our CoreValve U.S. pivotal trial, we completed enrollment in our extreme-risk arm back in January and are in the continued access phase. On the high-risk arm, we expect to be fully enrolled in the coming weeks.","Turning to Endovascular. Revenue of $209 million grew 17% with strong balanced growth across our aortic and peripheral businesses. In aortic, growth was driven by the adoption of our next-generation Endurant II abdominal stent graft. In peripheral, we are opening new accounts with our Complete SE stent. Growth is also being driven by the continued adoption of our Assurant Cobalt iliac stent. Our impact drug-eluting balloons delivered strong double-digit growth in international markets, and we are making progress with our IN.PACT global registry and U.S. pivotal study.","Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1,893,000,000 grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation, Diabetes and Core Spine, partially offset by declines in BMP.","Spine revenue of $786 million declined 3% globally and 5% in the U.S., mainly driven by declines in BMP. Global Core Spine results of $645 million grew 1% with flat growth in the U.S. These results were in line with the growth of the core spine market, which was roughly flat both globally and in the U.S. It is worth noting that excluding Kyphon, which was slightly down in the U.S. and down low-double digits internationally, our Core Spine business grew 1% in the U.S. and 2% globally. We are seeing improvement in our business as new products and procedures gain scale through increased product family capabilities, number of tests in the field and surgeon training events. In thoracolumbar, we began our full market release of Solera 5.5 and 6.0 in Q1 and nearly doubled our number of Solera Sextant minimally invasive sets in the field. Solera, with its attractive combination of navigation and powered instruments, is generating strong surgeon interest.","In cervical, we increased the number of ATLANTIS VISION ELITE cervical plate sets by 20%, which is helping to improve growth. In interbody, although the Q1 revenue from our AMT acquisition was modest due to the limited release, surgeon interest exceeded our expectations. We intend to launch our AMT implants at NASS in October and believe that in addition to improving our interbody growth, these innovative implants will generate pull-through revenue for the rest of our thoracolumbar portfolio. Our Other Biologics portfolio had strong double-digit growth with continued adoption of our Grafton and MagniFuse DBMs.","In BMP, revenue of $140 million declined 19%, including a 20% decline in the U.S., although the results were stable sequentially. It is important to note that BMP is one of our lower-margin products, muting its impact to the -- our bottom line. As Omar mentioned, we expect the results of the Yale study on INFUSE to be published in the coming months.","Surgical Technologies revenue of $324 million grew 24%, which included $34 million of revenue from Advanced Energy. Organic revenue growth was 11%, driven by strong U.S. sales of capital equipment, including our StealthStation S7, O-Arm and Fusion IGS systems. This strong performance also reflects increased surgeon demand for our navigated spine procedural solutions. In addition to capital sales, Surgical Technologies continues to benefit from balanced growth of disposables and service revenue across our power, monitoring, advanced energy, imaging and navigation platforms.","Turning to Neuromodulation. Revenue of $419 million increased 8%. Our Pain Stim business had double-digit growth, driven by sales of our RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator with AdaptiveStim technology. Our DBS business continued to show strong results, led by solid new implant growth in the U.S. Our Uro\/Gastro business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, driven by adoption of our InterStim Therapy. We also want to let you know that we recently received a warning letter in our Neuromodulation business. We are working with the FDA to resolve the issues, which primarily relate to our complaint handling and catheter [ph] processes. We do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial results.","Diabetes revenue of $364 million grew 6%, driven by double-digit growth in CGM. International sales of insulin pumps were also up double digits as Veo, with its low-glucose suspend feature, continues to lead the market. In U.S., we are anticipating FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump and Enlite Sensor to occur in late FY '13, which we expect to reaccelerate growth in the U.S.","Turning to the rest of the income statement. The Q1 gross margin was 75.7%. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our gross margin was 75.9%. We continue to offset pricing pressure through our 5-year $1.2 billion cost of goods sales reduction program. For FY '13, we expect gross margins to remain in the range of 75.5% to 76% on an operational basis.","First quarter R&D spending of $385 million was 9.6% of revenue. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, the R&D spend was 9.4% of revenue, which was driven by higher clinical trial spending in transcatheter valves and renal denervation. We remain committed to investing in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. And for FY '13, we continue to expect R&D spending to be approximately 9% on an operational basis.","First quarter SG&A expenditures of $1,405,000,000 represented 35.1% of sales. In Q1, we recognized $8 million of bad debt due to a single distributor in Greece. Excluding this and the impact of foreign currency, SG&A would have been 34.8% of sales. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses, while at the same time, investing in new product launches and adding to our sales force in faster growing businesses and geographies. In FY '13, we expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement.","Net other expense for the quarter was $39 million. Net gains from our hedging programs were $20 million during the quarter. As you know, we hedge much of our operating results to reduce the volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Based on the current exchange rates, we expect FY '13 net other expense will be in the range of $180 million to $210 million. This includes the expected impact from the U.S. med-tech tax that will begin in January and higher royalty expense due to increased sales of Resolute Integrity. For Q2 FY '13, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $35 million to $45 million.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $33 million. Excluding the $23 million noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $10 million. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $10.8 billion in cash and cash investments and $10.8 billion of debt. For FY '13, we expect non-GAAP net interest expense in the range of $70 million to $80 million, which excludes the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.","Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 20.6%. Excluding the impact of onetime items, our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q1 was 20.9%. This quarter's tax rate was higher than expected and negatively affected by a finalization of certain tax returns and changes to uncertain tax position reserves, as well as the lack of the U.S. R&D tax credit extension. Together, these items totaled $13 million, which had a 120-basis point impact on our tax rate and over $0.01 impact on our earnings per share. For FY '13, we expect an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19.5% to 20.5%. This does not include any benefit for the U.S. R&D tax credit, which has not yet been extended by Congress. Historically, the R&D tax credit has had an annual benefit in the range of $30 million to $35 million or approximately $0.01 per quarter.","In Q1, we generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders, and during Q1, we repurchased $470 million of our common stock or approximately 1% of our outstanding shares. As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 46 million shares. First quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,037,000,000 shares.","Let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal year 2013 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. While we are encouraged with our top line performance in the past couple of quarters, we continue to be focused on delivering consistent results. At this point, we want to remain conservative, so we are not changing our FY '13 constant currency growth outlook of 2% to 4% from continuing operations. Although we cannot predict the impact of foreign currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact, if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY '13 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $400 million to $430 million, including a negative $140 million to $160 million impact in Q2.","Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We continue to expect FY '13 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.62 to $3.70, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. It is -- it's also worth noting that while we do not provide quarterly guidance, when looking at the quarterly gaining of EPS consensus, we would not be surprised to see some models shift a couple of pennies from Q2 to Q4. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year nor do they include the impact of the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.","I will now turn the call back over to Omar who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?","Omar S. Ishrak","Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, let me just conclude by reiterating that although we were encouraged by our Q1 results, we recognize that we need to deliver this kind of performance consistently over the long term. While we're keeping a close eye on certain markets, on an overall basis, our end markets continue to stabilize. That trend, along with the breadth and scale of our business, our leading product portfolio, our recently launched products and our economic, value-oriented, go-to-market strategies, are beginning to make a difference. We're also preparing ourselves for changes in the global healthcare environment by implementing our strategies of economic value and globalization. We believe that all of this, combined with our strong capital allocation policies, positions us to create long-term value in healthcare.","With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group, and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to join us for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","Operator, first question, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Omar, for you. The U.S. definitely has turned around for you the last couple of quarters, but if you look at emerging markets, 2 of the last 3 quarters now you've been below 20%. I think your goal is actually to be above 20%. So what are you seeing -- my sense is this has got to be China, Latin America, just looking at some of the growth rates. Is this execution, or is it more market?","Omar S. Ishrak","I would actually say that it's more execution rather than anything else. As we've put our growth strategy in place, it's going to take a while, and there's going to be some level of variability quarter-over-quarter this period as we put our long-term strategies in place. I don't think it's the market itself because the healthcare demand is actually strong. Countries -- China is still investing heavily in healthcare. They're not -- despite the overall economy, there is some pressure where the government is very insistent on investing in healthcare. In places like Latin America and in India, there's demand from the population. So we don't see that as the market itself. We just need to make sure that our strategies all get into place. And over time, we will try to drive a little more consistency here, but that's what we're facing right now.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I mean, do you think 20% range for this fiscal year is still the goal?","Omar S. Ishrak","That's certainly our goal, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, Omar, you've gotten, with this quarter, your organic growth back up to what looks like about a 3.5% range, so a nice quarter. A couple of businesses that appear to hold you back a little bit this quarter is, one, the pacemaker business and, two, Diabetes was a little bit light in the U.S. So I was hoping you could talk about, and maybe Mike can jump in, on the pacemaker market, because it's not a Medtronic issue. Why are -- not only has pricing gotten a little bit worse in pacemakers but volumes appear to be contracting. I would love your opinion on that. And then two, maybe for Chris, maybe you can just comment on why the U.S. Diabetes business was flat this quarter.","Omar S. Ishrak","Sure. Let me make a few comments upfront, and then I'll ask both Mike and Chris to make some comments as well. First, the Pacing market, we see about 3 or 4 reasons here in general. The -- and our results were a bit weaker than expected. It was mostly price. And remember, we anniversaried our Revo MRI launch, so that's had some impact. But also, the destocking and the reduction in bulk purchases in Pacing was a factor. But in the end -- also, the procedure volume was lower. And we don't -- haven't quite gotten to the bottom of exactly why. And I'm sure Mike will have some thoughts on that, so I'll let him comment on that in a minute. In terms of Diabetes, the results were primarily related to a replacement cycle issue. And we were building excitement for the new products and it might remain a challenge until we get our FDA approval in FY '13. But it's primarily a replacement cycle issue in the U.S. That's what we're seeing. So, Mike, you want to go first, if you would, about the pacing market question.","Michael J. Coyle","As Omar mentioned, it is the 3 items that he outlined. And on the procedure volume side, I would say that, really, we saw the procedure volumes starting to drop in the first half of FY '12 and they actually began to stabilize on sort of market implant rates here in the U.S. in Q3 of last year. So we're now heading into the third quarter where they've been relatively stable, in fact, up slightly. So we think the prior-year comparisons are showing significant declines. But as we get later into the year, we think that those will normalize. As for what's behind it, we've been trying to dig into that and really have not come up with good answers. So it looks like the general economy may have something to do with that. But generally speaking, we don't have a good answer for it other than to say it appears to now have stabilized, and we should start to see that by our Q3.","Omar S. Ishrak","And, Chris, can you say a few words about the Diabetes?","Christopher J. O'Connell","Yes. Mike, certainly, the growth in the U.S. was a little more modest than we expect. And the market, as we've been commenting in recent quarters, has been a little bit softer in the recent year or so with the consumer economy. As Omar said, our replacement cycle is currently negative in the U.S. However, I will say that our new pump starts, what we call new pumps, our new patients, was positive in the quarter, which makes us feel good. In addition to that, the international business was very strong. The big event in the U.S. is obviously going to be the launch of the 530G at the end of the fiscal year. So we're all looking forward to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, just a quick modeling question here. Just the second quarter commentary you made versus consensus numbers of the $0.02 potentially moving from the second to the fourth. I'm just sort of thinking about the first quarter. SG&A actually would have been stronger if you would make the -- take out the Greek adjustment. And thinking about R&D being heavier in the first quarter, could you just kind of provide us a little commentary on why the second quarter numbers would be a little lower than consensus, or why that? Do you see those $0.02 moving from the second to the fourth?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. Well, all we're trying to get that -- and we're not trying -- I mean, all of you have to adjust your models based on what you think is appropriate. All we know -- we're highlighting is the fact that for the full year, and what you saw here in the first quarter, we've given guidance of earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. It was 8% in Q1. And as you said, it could have been a little better without the SG&A bad debt expense we had. But the issue you have in Q2 last year, the comparison, there was a couple of cents in there related to a gain on our investment in PEAK and Salient. And so if you just look at the consensus currently, it would indicate earnings per share growth of 10% after adjusting for that in Q2, which is obviously significantly above where we were here and where our guidance is at, and that's with assuming the R&D tax credit is not extended yet. So the idea that Q2 would have the higher earnings per share growth versus what I think right now the consensus is showing is a very low earnings per share growth in Q4, we're just saying is the models look like they could probably be shifting a little bit more from Q2 to Q4.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just a quick follow-up here for maybe others in the group. On the Cardiovascular, specifically Coronary side, obviously, you saw another very strong quarter, second sequential quarter. Can you just give us a sense of where you think you are? You talked about some of this at the Analyst Day in terms of account penetration with RESOLUTE. I think you mentioned at the Analyst Day that you were maybe 25% to 30% of accounts still had not been penetrated. Maybe just give us an update on where that penetration stands, and can we see another very strong performance or an accelerated performance in the next quarter?","Omar S. Ishrak","Sure, yes. I mean, first, let me make a comment and say that we continue to be pleased by the results. And every time I go out in the field and talk to customers, there is strong acceptance of this product. And I can see personally, when I go to the field with our own CRDM reps, that -- how engaged they are in using their relationship to open the doors for overall CVG strategy to work. But let me ask Mike to give some more specifics.","Michael J. Coyle","Sure. I think at the analyst meeting, we talked about targeting a 25-plus percent market share. We would estimate out of the data that we saw here for Q1, we're probably sitting around a 27% market share. I think we've gotten through the primary accounts that -- where we had strong positions with the Integrity bare-metal stent prior to the release of the Resolute Integrity. And now we're really going to be relying on the broader CVG strategy, the leverage that we have with our commitment to next-generation technologies in interventional cardiology like renal denervation, like transcatheter valves, as well as the broad strategic account management programs that I outlined at the analyst meeting that are really -- help you drive economic value in these accounts. So we think there is still upside to share available to us, although it certainly won't come in the chunks that we saw the last 2 quarters. But we do believe that there is still meaningful share upside for us on the Coronary side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could maybe quantify or give some color just around renal denervation sales, as well as TAVI this color -- this quarter, just around whether or not you're still seeing renal denervation grow. Some of your comments suggested that it was -- seems to be getting a little bit tougher in the pre-reimbursement environment, and I think you had mentioned TAVI was up double digits. But any commentary on what you're seeing just kind of in the overall market?","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. Kristen, I'm going to ask Mike to take this one.","Michael J. Coyle","So on the renal denervation side, renal denervation continues to be the fastest-growing product line that we have within CVG. So it is a very nice growth driver for us. But this is very much a market development exercise. There are significant issues for us to focus on in terms of market development, including working in referral base, these are physicians who basically have patients who have not been generally referred for device interventions so we have to very much focus on developing those referral channels, and also reimbursement. As you know, in Europe, they're not looking for new things to pay for in healthcare budgets, so we have to use the very compelling data that we're generating to get reimbursement. We continue to see progress on both of those fronts. In fact, in Europe, this past quarter, we have really begun to focus our focus on renal denervation reps on market development and are starting to use our Coronary reps to help with the actual procedure support, which I think is going to really help us continue to develop those referral chains. And then on the reimbursement side, the data continues to be extremely strong on the sustainability of the benefit for hypertension reduction renal denervation, and we continue to work to expand the reimbursement levels throughout Europe. On the transcatheter valve side, the market growth rates that we talked about for Europe on the TAVI side were in that 15% to 18% kind of range, and we continue to expect that as the growth rates that we will see in that area. We continue to split the market with our primary competitor in that space, and we continue to have very robust new product flow with the Evolut product introduction here just in the past quarter. So we expect to continue to see strong growth in that segment of our business.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And would you be willing to just kind of give out a renal denervation number or comment if it was higher sequentially?","Omar S. Ishrak","No. I think at this stage, I think we've said we have to...","Michael J. Coyle","It's slightly higher sequentially, but we don't have the number to give out at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My question was on the ICD market in the U.S. I think you talked about implants being up 4% year-over-year. And I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more in terms of your expectations for volume and pricing, not just for Medtronic but really what you're thinking the market is at right now.","Omar S. Ishrak","The overall market is down in the U.S., and -- but we do see the implant volumes growing. But at the same time, as I pointed out earlier, the hospital destocking is a real factor. I think hospitals are working to reduce their inventories and reduce their level of bulk purchases, like we said. And for us, actually, in many ways, we can use that to our advantage, in the sense that the level of discount that we have to give out for that instead we can transfer that to multiline deals, which are probably better for us. But we do see an overall reduction in the market by both of those drivers, although implant volumes appear to be relatively stable. But I'm sure Mike can add a lot more color to this. Go ahead.","Michael J. Coyle","So for the U.S. market, we are seeing modest low-single digit improvement in the implant growth rates for the market, as obviously, we've now anniversaried the issues with the original DoJ investigation, and now we're starting to see a return to growth. Pricing continues to be obviously a drag on the market but still low-single digit sort of pricing pressure. So as you can see, we're encouraged, going forward, that we're going to continue to see implant growth rates. And obviously, we think we have upside not only from that perspective but also in overall market share, as we are now going to be heading into a new product release cycle with the Viva\/Brava products we just announced, the CE Mark in Europe for those 2 products. We will have the EVERA product line coming in, in the fourth quarter, and then those product lines will come to the U.S. next year, including the Advisa MRI pacemaker next year. So we see some nice catalysts for continued market share capture with that product flow coming.","Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And would it be fair to characterize your expectations for both the U.S. and x U.S. markets as roughly flat on a revenue basis?","Michael J. Coyle","That would be a reasonable assumption, flat to slightly down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I wanted to ask a few questions on Spine. You had the best Core Spine x Kyphon growth that I think you've seen in quite some time, and so I was wondering if you could just flesh that out a little bit. Do you really think that the market is improving, or is it that you feel like you've -- that you're gaining share? Is it mix? Just a little more color on what's driven the improvement in the Core Spine x Kyphon growth rates that you highlighted today.","Omar S. Ishrak","I think it's both. The market is stabilizing to some degree. But I do think that -- we've been working and getting our new product launches tighter. And the procedures we're creating, surgeons -- there's a lot of acceptance on our new procedures. And I don't want to minimize our synergy with capital equipment purchases. When you put all that together, I think we are -- our performance is definitely improving, and it's not unreasonable to expect us to gain a little bit of share in Core Spine as we go ahead. I think that's something that's in our expectation, and we can prove that. It's very early. It's only one quarter that we've had this kind of performance. But we're encouraged to see the thing turn around. I think -- Chris, I'm sure you have some comments on this, so go ahead.","Christopher J. O'Connell","Sure, yes. Bob, that's exactly right. The market is stable, and I think what's going on is our relative performance is definitely improving. And a lot of that is just the story we've been continuing to tell about the new products. So you take the Solera, for example, we're out in force this summer with the 5.5\/6.0, which is the larger rod diameters, and we've seen that business really double sequentially as we've got more sets out into the field. Lot more navigated spine surgery going on. Keep in mind, we have an installed base now of O-Arms in the U.S. of 250 and over 1,000 StealthStations, with those numbers even bigger when you look at the global picture. So clearly, some of the strategies we've been developing, both on the individual product line segments, as well as with the procedural innovation, are really moving the needle. Another example is the MAST MIDLF procedure we talked about at the analyst meeting. We now have over 300 surgeons utilizing that procedure. We've done over 1,000 procedures. So we're -- we are pleased with our trajectory at this point and obviously see that to be a continuing story.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just as a follow-up on Spine. In the Yale study, you mentioned it'll read out in the next couple of months. I'm just curious, do you know the conclusions of the Yale study at this point, and are you optimistic relative to the outcome or are you blinded to that?","Omar S. Ishrak","No. We're really blinded to that. That's completely outside. It's a third-party thing, and Yale is managing that. And we're waiting for the results, just like everybody else.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Do you know specifically when we will see that?","Omar S. Ishrak","I think within the next few months. Certainly before the end of the year, we are expecting to see that.","Christopher J. O'Connell","We're expecting sometime here in the coming months, but we think again -- the timing is still all tied to Yale. But we are expecting in the next couple of months. That's the expectation from them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","Topher Orr - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's actually Topher Orr in for David. I just had a quick question as it relates to earnings leverage. This quarter, obviously, you posted about 5% constant currency top line growth with 8% EPS. Given that you guys maintain guidance in the 2% to 4% range, if we were to move lower, say, just arguments sake, in -- more in the 3% range for constant currency growth, how should we think about EPS leverage?","Omar S. Ishrak","I think our range of 5% to 7% still holds, and we are confident that we can deliver on that just -- and sort of take into any variables that come our way. I think beyond that, Gary, maybe you have some thoughts.","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. I mean, as we indicated, we -- obviously, on a constant currency basis, as we indicated, we did 5% this quarter. Now as reported, obviously, it's 2%, and so the earnings per share is as-reported number. So we've got to cover all the foreign currency negativity to get to the bottom line. So we did that and made the investments we needed here in the first quarter. But as we indicated in my comments, the reality is we are expecting leverage for the full year. And the 2% to 4% guidance, if you pick 3%, that's where -- for the year what you pick for our growth rate, we are still -- our earnings per share guidance is still in that 5% to 7% range. So there is still leverage. We're expecting 30 to 50 basis points of leverage in SG&A. We're expecting the R&D expense for the year will not be quite as high as we saw here in Q1 as we kind of go forward through the rest of the year. And as we highlighted, depending on what you assume in the tax rate, there's obviously should be -- assuming the R&D tax credit gets renewed, there's even more additional leverage there. So there's a lot of different factors that we think will continue to provide additional leverage as we go through the year, even in light of some of the headwinds we're going to have to face with the medical device tax, et cetera. So our guidance assumes that we do achieve continued operating leverage in the current year, and we have every expectation to deliver on there.","Topher Orr - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Then just one quick follow-up if I could. Omar, I know in the past you have -- you've talked about kind of May, June of 2013 time frame for completion of your overall in-depth business analysis. I was wondering, do you have any update on timing. Are you guys ahead or behind on that schedule? Or do you still anticipate sort of the same timing in terms of completing it?","Omar S. Ishrak","No. We're well in the process of doing that. I mean, this is like a continuous effort and we've been through a few rounds of that, and we've analyzed our businesses. At this stage, we're okay with the portfolio. I think there are some sub-segments which we're looking at, some smaller businesses, and we will optimize our portfolio accordingly. But we've been through one round of analyzing our businesses, and these things aren't that black and white. There are some areas that we are looking at, and in some areas we have to shore up with, perhaps, acquisitions all around the guidelines that I've said before. And in some areas, we don't have enough critical mass, and we're seeing what the best way there is to achieve that. So we will look at this thing on an ongoing basis, and the actions are also dependent on exactly what we find and then the actions result in other actions. So it really isn't black and white, so I wouldn't wait for some kind of milestone event, where suddenly we decide that we've got a dramatically different portfolio. We'll adjust this as we go along.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","One question for Mike and one question for Gary. Mike, it seems like the TAVI program will hit the U.S. endpoints is my guess anyway. Do you feel that the kind of blemishes ascribed to the device, paravalve leak, pacemaking, maybe left bundle branch block, if you do hit the endpoints, would be a sufficient stumbling block to create a high risk for approval or delay?","Omar S. Ishrak","Go ahead, Mike. I think Mike should take this one.","Michael J. Coyle","So, Bruce, I think I'd take issue with your underlying assumptions there. I think as we look at the high-quality clinical evidence that's being generated here, especially, obviously, our U.S. clinical study and then the advanced registry, which really is extremely well controlled and supervised registry study, I mean, we're seeing just excellent performance from the overall product. And I think it's dangerous to look at data that may be several years old when the device was used in different ways before the ACCU TRACK technology was available, when there were different implant techniques in terms of depth of placement of the valve. The current data, and I think especially the current reports that you're seeing, show really excellent performance on overall perivalvular leak, as well as pacemaker implants now in sustained use down in the low teens with -- even reports down around 10%, 11%. So we feel very good about the trajectory of the program, and we think that the clinical evidence that's being generated, it is very high quality and very much supported that this is a technology that really is a very strong performer. And if you look at overall market share positions in Europe where this is released, I mean, we are essentially neck and neck with our primary competitor in those areas, which I think is a testament to the performance of the technology. So we feel very good about it.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And, Gary, just -- is there -- is it draconian kind of outcome for BMP figuring in into the guidance range for revenue this year, or is that really just a very remote kind of possibility that's not seriously impacting your guidance range?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. I mean, obviously, Bruce, what our guidance is assuming right now is that the INFUSE product line continues kind of at the levels that it's been in the last several quarters. We'll all have to wait and see what happens with the Yale results. And how that would potentially impact the guidance, we don't know at this point in time and then it could have been -- if it's positive, we see that could be a potential upside. If it's continued concerns, obviously, that could be potential negativity. So we've tried to bring some of that in there. But the reality is it's kind of assuming that we kind of continue along with the same kind of levels with INFUSE as what our guidance is based on right now, and we'll have to see what the results of the Yale studies indicate.","Omar S. Ishrak","I think that's probably the best way to put it, Bruce. It's -- we're assuming kind of where it is right now. And there is some range in our guidance, so it could -- and then also depends on other things that happen. That's not the only factor. But it does probably -- we can absorb a little bit of negativity, but also there may be positive results as well. So we really don't know, and so we left it the way -- the way it's stabilized as of today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.","Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess first, I just wanted to hone in on the ICD business. This business stabilized quicker than we anticipated, and you guys outperformed the market. Can you just talk about the inter-quarter cadence of the performance of that business unit? Would -- did you see any improvement in the back half of the quarter, in June and July?","Omar S. Ishrak","I -- Mike, probably. I don't know anything of note, but, Mike, you're closer to it.","Michael J. Coyle","I wouldn't comment on this quarter trends. I think generally speaking, we feel like we're seeing a nice return in terms of stabilization of the market implant rates for ICDs, and we're also obviously seeing, I think, some very nice share trends for us. I think we referenced in our introductory remarks here, we're seeing a nice improvement in lead-to-can ratios in the ICD side. They are now back to pre-Fidelis levels, actually above pre-Fidelis levels in terms of those ratios. And we're seeing a nice improvement in terms of overall market share on the replacement side, which actually even highlights the lead-to-can ratio improvement, because obviously, on those implants, we're not getting the lead. So we really do feel as though the trends are really being driven by market share capture for us and stabilization of implant growth rates, and obviously, we have the headwind of the pricing pressure, which, as I mentioned, is kind of a low-single digit drag on the overall market. So generally speaking, we're going to -- we feel like those trends are likely to continue.","Gary L. Ellis","This is Gary. Just to add one comment to what Omar and Mike said is that we do -- we have indicated that what we did see in the historical data was that June and July of last year was kind of -- seem to be the kind of the valley as far as how -- of where the market went. And that's where we started to saw it starting to stabilize was after that period of time. So the comparisons, clearly, have gotten better as we've gotten to this point, and now we're comparing to the low point of where we were at previously.","Michael J. Coyle","And the other thing that I would just mention is that Omar referenced the reductions in hospital inventories. I mean, those were meaningful in the quarter. We expect that our overall inventory shares of our products would probably be down over 15% in the U.S. hospitals. So to be showing absolute revenue share capture against that headwind, we think, is a significant testament to the fact that we are getting nice share capture trends. But again, we expect those trends to continue as well, the hospital inventory compression.","Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And can you just follow that up with your outlook on the o U.S. ICD marketplace from a pricing and volume standpoint? And lastly for Mike, you talked about some of the -- those metrics on the CoreValve and some of the data that's being generated on the newer technology with the ACCU TRACK. Any time lines in terms of when we can see some of that in print and -- just so people can get more conviction around that improvement?","Omar S. Ishrak","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael J. Coyle","So on international ICD trends, I think the -- in Europe, we actually are seeing very similar trends in terms of procedure growth and pricing pressure. They're both very similar to what we saw in the U.S., and so I wouldn't highlight those as being meaningfully different. I would point out that our ICD shares in Europe are at the highest level in probably 3 years. And then we will continue to release data on the advance registry outcomes as that data becomes available, so you'll continue to see that come out at the major meetings over time. And then of course, the U.S. submissions are right on track with what we had discussed at the analyst meeting 3 months ago. So there's no changes to timing expectations there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Gary, I just wanted to start by following up on your revenue guidance. I appreciate the conservatism that you've mentioned. But where do you think -- where do you see potential risk for a deceleration in sales growth versus what you're seeing this quarter? You've already mentioned that INFUSE is probably not one of the areas that you could see a -- you're anticipating further deceleration. So where are the potential areas of risk here that might get us back to kind of more the midpoint of your revenue guidance?","Omar S. Ishrak","Let me just -- first of all, the INFUSE, there may well be risk. We just said that we modeled it flat. But in that sense, we model a lot of things a certain way. And there's definitely risk -- potential risk in INFUSE, and that's one of the factors in our range. Other areas like Europe, I mean, you just -- you can pick up the newspaper and look at what's going on in Europe. And again, our view has been and it's been confirmed that the healthcare budgets are being protected, and our teams are saying that. And they're executing and we're seeing the numbers. But you've got to be a little cautious about what's happening there, and we will watch them very carefully. I think outside of that, I am a little concerned about emerging markets as well, like I mentioned earlier. I think it will get there to 20%. I think our modeling -- actually, the financial modeling doesn't quite have it at 20%, so I'm not sure there'll be downside there. I think, Gary, you can add a little bit more color.","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. I mean, I think Omar has indicated some of the -- clearly, some of the risks that we still see in the quarter and are assuming in the year. And that the reality is, Derrick, I mean, obviously, we're encouraged over the last couple of quarters. We've seen some -- a return to growth, and obviously, we've seen some real positive results coming from Resolute Integrity. And we will be anniversary-ing the PEAK and Salient acquisition here in this quarter, so that's been a little bit of an upside that we won't have as we go forward. That being said, I mean, we're giving guidance of 2% to 4%, and we're just -- our markets have been volatile over the last couple of years, and we are seeing stabilization, which is good. But we're going to be cautious until we see that those continue to be stable and continue to grow. And so as Omar indicated, let's see a few more quarters of that happening before we get too far ahead of ourselves and report our guidances. And there are still risks out there in some of these markets. We -- our teams are managing relatively well at this point through them. But at some point in time, does that have an impact on us also, whether it's Europe or some of these other areas. So that's why we kept the guidance where we're at, at this point. And we're hopeful that we're being conservative. But right now, let's not get ahead of ourselves.","Omar S. Ishrak","And I'd like to also repeat the fact that consistency in delivery is very important for us. And as I said before, the guidance is irrespective of market conditions. I can't be absolutely 100% on that, but we will do our very best to absorb hits to the market or any uncertainties that are outside of our control. That's why the guidance is where it is. And as we see the our overall growth rate from our businesses grow, we'll be more comfortable. But one quarter is not enough, not even close for us to draw a conclusion like that, and we need several more quarters of dependable, consistent performance before we can claim any sort of success.","Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And if I could just sneak in a quick follow-up on your DES business. You're showing clearly some very impressive share gains off of Resolute Integrity, but the overall global DES market continues to decline. Now I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you think about that DES market beyond your share gains. And once you anniversary those share gains, how do you kind of think about your business moving forward?","Omar S. Ishrak","I think we've got our pipeline growing. But again, Mike, you're best to comment on it.","Michael J. Coyle","I would point out that we've not even entered the Japanese market yet with that product, which, as we bring that out in the second largest DES market in the world, we're going to see a year-plus worth of continued growth driven from that. And then obviously, as we continue to work that pipeline but then begin to expand our new product entries in the international cardiology space to include renal denervation, to include transcatheter valve technologies, we think we have a sustainable interventional cardiology growth profile here for years to come. So to us, it's all about a portfolio of products, some at various stages of their product life cycles, and we continue to see that. And not only have those as growth drivers but have that as a part of our overall program to have international cardiologists look to Medtronic as the partner that they want to have long term, which we think is going to help us move up from where our share positions are on DES, even from where we are.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It's really 2 parts. The first one is, as we've been hearing about inventory management of the ICDs and pacemakers now for several quarters, at what stage is an inventory management done? I mean, for you to be able to drop 15% this quarter in one of those segments, that's a lot. And then the second thing is, as I was listening to your verbiage on M&A and a more ROIC-focused management team, are you trying to tell us something?","Omar S. Ishrak","I mean, the second one, first, I'm trying to tell you that ROIC is a big focus for us. And I just want to emphasize that, and that we'll be very disciplined with our acquisitions. And the criteria that we've made out is very clear. We want to cover dilution. I mean, there are always exceptions, but the hurdle will be very high. And we want to cover first within the business, the business here at making acquisition, and the EPS -- potential EPS dilution, then within the corporation. And as a last resort, we may decide to pass it on to the shareholders. We'll have to justify, and that hurdle is very, very high. And if you do that, then that drives better ROICs, and we're looking at ROIC as a very active measure. And to make it even stronger, we're making sure that our management team and beyond are being compensated as a result of that. So that's what I'm trying to say, that ROIC is extremely important.","Michael J. Coyle","As for the inventory management questions around the pacemaker and ICD market, we're very much managing that from the standpoint that we're -- as Omar mentioned, cutting back on the extent of discounting that we'll provide for bulk purchases in that area, because frankly, we find that very matchable by competitors. Whereas if we use that same level of discounting in broader multiline product deals, especially now that we have Resolute Integrity in our bag and then, obviously, leadership positions in multiple cardiology areas, we think those are much more difficult for competitors to match up to. So we are very much in the process of managing those inventory reductions. And as you can see, we're able to do that in the context of the guidance that we've provided.","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. And then the hospitals actually -- as I visit hospitals, look, the cost sensitivity in hospitals is very, very high, and they're looking over their books with a great deal of detail. And I find some hospitals and hospitals systems are finding this to be an area where they're optimizing their inventory balance, which any good business ought to do. And I've got no idea how much more optimization there is to go, but like Mike mentioned, we've got pretty good strategy that deals with it. So I think that's where we stand on that one.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I hand the program back over to management for closing remarks.","Omar S. Ishrak","Okay. Well, thank you very much for all your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you all again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic.","We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q2 call in November. So thanks again.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the program over to Jeff Warren, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jeff Warren","Thank you, Christie. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2012 third quarter which ended January 27, 2012. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investor's portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant-currency basis.","And with that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar S. Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff. And thank you to everyone joining us today. This morning we reported third quarter revenue of $3.9 billion, which represents 2% growth as reported, and 1% on a constant currency basis. Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $888 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.84 increased 8% and 9%, respectively, after adjusting for the onetime tax benefits in Q3 of last year. From a revenue perspective this was a challenging quarter. But looking down the P&L, we saw solid performance in our gross margin, and our team executed to deliver the bottom line.","Our Q3 revenue reflects strength in the majority of our business. But at the same time, we face continued challenges in our 2 largest businesses, ICDs and Spine. Similar to recent quarters, our results were bifurcated, with 2\/3 of our business boasting strong performances, growing a combined 9% while the remaining third declined 9%. However, as I will explain, it does appear that both the ICD and spine markets are beginning to show signs of stabilization, which will result in easier comparisons and should improve our growth over the coming quarters.","Let me discuss ICDs first. From a revenue perspective, the U.S. market declined in the mid-teens year-over-year, a couple of percentage points lower than Q2. However, our market data indicates the procedure volumes were relatively stable for the third quarter in a row, and we believe that the sequential market slowdown was primarily caused by hospital de-stocking. Looking now at our own performance, our U.S. ICD revenue was down 14% year-over-year and was just under 2 percentage points lower than Q2. But our implant volumes rose consistently in Q3 and that trend has continued into Q4. In fact, we are currently seeing year-over-year implant volume growth for the first time in over a year. In addition, our U.S. ICD pricing was sequentially flat in Q3, improving from mid-single digit to low-single digit declines year-over-year. As a result, we can conclude that our sequential revenue decline was primarily a result of hospital de-stocking. ","It is also worth mentioning that even though we faced these revenue headwinds, our U.S. ICD share is up over 1 point in the past year, and we have maintained those gains sequentially, despite competitors' new product launches and without incurring the typical sequential share declines we see at competitors' fiscal year-ends. Given the fact that the market is showing signs of sequential stability, we are cautiously optimistic that year-over-year declines in the U.S. ICD market should lessen over the coming quarters. This would significantly improve the performance of our U.S. ICD business and with a corresponding impact on our overall corporate growth rate. To put this in perspective, if we can improve our U.S. ICD revenue to flat year-over-year results over the coming quarters, this alone would add nearly 1.5 points to Medtronic's overall growth.","Turning now to Spine. I was not happy with our overall performance, but let me focus my comments on core metal and biologics separately, as each had unique dynamics affecting its performance. In core metal, we estimate that the U.S. market declined in the low-single digits, which is slightly worse than Q2. Our business declined 10% in the U.S., and while we lost nearly 1 point of share sequentially, we did hold share versus the major spine competitors on a comparable basis. A large part of our share pressure continues to come from certain smaller spine companies such as physician-owned distributors, which utilize business models and tactics that are coming under increasingly negative public scrutiny.  ","Looking ahead, we are somewhat optimistic, given the positive trends we saw in the last month of Q3 and that have continued so far into Q4. Now while we cannot be certain as to the drivers of these trends, and the market pressures remain with reimbursement in price, we do know that our new products are gaining traction. Our product and procedural innovation combined with better sales execution is becoming more visible to surgeons and generating measurable growth in our new product lines. While our Q4 core metal results are likely to still be down year-over-year, assuming current revenue trends continue, we do expect better performance in Q4.","Let's now discuss BMP, where U.S. INFUSE sales continue to deteriorate. In Q2, the year-over-year revenue decline was in the upper teens, which worsened to 30% in Q3. We saw an incremental decrease a few weeks after negative and highly controversial data was presented at NASS in the beginning of November. This impact was more than we expected at the start of Q3. While the largest declines were realized in late November and December, the declines have been in the 20% to 30% range since the beginning of January. Until we get definitive answers from the Yale study in the first half of FY '13, there will be considerable uncertainty around our INFUSE financial results. As I said previously, we believe in the safety and efficacy of INFUSE for approved indications. But we want to address any controversies by understanding the facts' that is why we commissioned the Yale university study, a very credible third party, to systematically analyze all available data.","In summary, while individually each part of Spine has explainable reasons for their performance, collectively, the year-over-year declines are simply not sustainable over the long term. While we continue to believe in the potential of this market, we urgently need to see meaningful signs of improvement from our current initiatives. If we do not, we will need to reassess our strategy and approach for this business.","Before leaving Spine, I do want to highlight the performance for our International Spine business, which should not go unnoticed. International sales now make up nearly 30% of Spine, and they continue to grow in the mid-single digits. As we work to stabilize our U.S. Spine business, I expect International Spine to be a consistent and solid contributor to our company's growth.","Let me now turn to the other 2\/3 of our business that is performing very well and growing at 9%. This sustained performance continues to demonstrate that innovation can drive growth even in the current market environment, both in the U.S. and around the world. In these businesses, our innovative products are, in many cases, capturing the interest of physicians, patients and hospital administrators. This ultimately allows us to enhance our pricing and grow our market share. An example of this is our Revo MRI pacemaker, a significant advancement in pacing that has contributed to over 4 points of share gain in the U.S. The market is putting a premium on Revo's unique MRI technology, which has revitalized pacing and shows us that new innovation can deliver growth even in a market that is already substantially penetrated. ","In addition to Revo, we have other exciting technologies, like the SYMPLICITY system for renal denervation, the CoreValve transcatheter valve, the RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator and the Enlite CGM sensor that are commercially available in many markets today and are driving growth. Furthermore, I'm pleased that our Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent received FDA approval late last week. This next-generation platform offers best-in-class deliverability and is the only drug-eluting stent approved for use in patients with diabetes. And finally, our international regions, again, delivered solid mid-single digit growth, including strong double-digit emerging market growth. Taken together, our portfolio of exciting new products and improving comparisons in our challenging markets should position us well to deliver improved growth over the long term.","More generally, we remain focused in the 3 key areas I've been emphasizing over the past 8 months: Improving execution, optimizing innovation and accelerating globalization. Crisp and consistent execution remains critical to delivering better and more predictable business performance. Some of the efforts in improving execution are starting to show results. For example, even with the revenue challenges this quarter, the team rapidly made the appropriate operational changes to deliver the bottom line. We continue to optimize our innovation process with a sharpened focus on customer economic value. We have started to operationalize this initiative in the following ways: First, we're incorporating customer economics in the commercial messaging for our key existing products; second, we're assembling specific data to quantitatively measure the economic value of selected offerings to providers and payers; third, we are engaging strategic customers in comprehensive Medtronic-wide partnerships to demonstrate the economic value that Medtronic can provide on a broad scale; and finally, we're incorporating customer economic value as a key criteria in our investment selection process. This is only the beginning, but we firmly believe that incorporating customer economic value is key to succeeding in the new healthcare environment.","Let's now discuss globalization. Our biggest near-term opportunity in emerging markets is in our existing therapies, which primarily address the premium segment, and these therapies have similar margins to what we routinely achieve in developed markets. To provide some perspective, just improving penetration of these therapies in emerging markets to a level similar to those in developed markets represents over $5 billion in annual opportunity. Longer term, the value segment is an additional opportunity. And we are beginning to take initial steps to realize it. We're laying the necessary groundwork to be the leaders in emerging value segment through our previously discussed $1 billion product cost-reduction initiative, combined with new business models and our investments in emerging market infrastructure. Through this structured approach, we're putting in place plans to grow our emerging market revenue to 20% of overall company revenue over the next few years.","In closing, I want to address our capital allocation strategy. We continue to generate significant free cash flow, generating over $1 billion this quarter. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders, which still allows us to make the necessary investments back into our business. I have given our business leaders clear direction to drive more discipline into our external investments, including the need for minimal to no EPS dilution. To the extent we don't identify targets that meet our strict value-creation criteria, we will look for ways to return excess cash to our shareholders. However, we're somewhat restricted today by the fact that the majority of our cash resides outside the U.S. I've tasked our organization to look at ways to improve our U.S. cash flows. Our dividend policy remains an important part of our return to shareholders. We were pleased that Standard & Poor's added us to their S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index, an elite group of companies that has consistently raised their dividends over several decades.","Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results, and at the end of the call I will make some brief closing comments. Gary?","Gary L. Ellis","Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $3,918,000,000 increased 2%, as reported, and 1% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $13 million favorable impact of foreign currency. While Physio-Control was part of Medtronic throughout Q3, we are treating it as a discontinued operation and our Medtronic revenue results do not include revenue from Physio-Control. ","Q3 revenue results, by region, were as follows: Central and Eastern Europe grew 28%; growth in South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East and Africa was 18%; greater China grew 12%; growth in our Western Europe and Canada region was 5%; Asia-Pacific grew 2%, including flat results in Japan; while the U.S. declined 3%. Emerging markets grew a combined 16% in Q3 and represented 10% of our total sales. It is important to point out that our results in greater China were negatively affected this quarter by the Chinese New Year, which fell in our Q3 this year while last year it was in our Q4. Accordingly, we would expect our greater China growth accelerate in Q4.","Q3 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $935 million and $0.88, an increase of 1% and 2%, respectively. After adjusting for certain acquisition-related items, Physio-Control divestiture-related items, as well as the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, third quarter earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $888 million and $0.84, a decrease of 4% and 2%, respectively. After adjusting for the onetime tax benefits we received in Q3 of last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 9%.","In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2,029,000,000 grew 1%. Results were driven by growth in Endovascular and Peripheral, Structural Heart, AF Solutions, Renal Denervation, Pacing and Coronary, offset by declines in ICDs. CRDM revenue of $1,192,000,000 declined 3%. Worldwide ICD revenue of $674 million declined 9%, and we estimate that the worldwide ICD market declined in the low double digits. Despite the continued market slowdown on a year-over-year basis, we believe the U.S. ICD market is showing signs of sequential stability. In addition, the combination of our Protecta ICD, with its shock reduction and lead integrity alert technologies along with the long-term proven performance of our Sprint Quattro defibrillation leads, which are also now available with a convenience of a DF 4-connector, continues to perform well, both in terms of share and pricing.","Pacing revenue of $467 million grew 3% in a market that declined in the low-single digits. Our U.S. Pacing business grew 8%, driven by the ongoing success of our Revo MRI SureScan pacemaker. Revo continues to command a mid-teens percentage price uplift, which is offsetting pricing pressure in the pacing market.","Our AF Solutions business grew in excess of 40%, driven by the ongoing successful U.S. launch and the continued adoption in Europe of our Arctic Front cryoballoon. We are taking share in the AF market. Although we would expect more moderate double-digit growth in Q4 as we anniversary the U.S. launch of Arctic Front.","Our Cardiovascular businesses had another strong quarter with revenue of $837 million, growing 8%, with 4% growth in the U.S. and 10% growth in international markets. Coronary revenue of $382 million grew 3%, and we maintained our #1 coronary stent position in markets where we had regulatory approval for both our Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent and Integrity bare-metal stent. Worldwide drug-eluting stent revenue in the quarter was $195 million, including $37 million in the U.S. We were pleased to received FDA approval of Resolute Integrity late last week, which we believe will be a meaningful driver of revenue growth and significant share gains.","To put the U.S. opportunity into perspective, in Europe, where Resolute Integrity is on the market and we have more competitors than in the U.S., our DES share is over double our U.S. share. Resolute Integrity is only \u2013 is also the only DES that has been approved for use in patients with diabetes, which is about 1\/3 of the U.S. patient mix. In the international markets, we continue to take DES share due to Resolute Integrity's deliverability and clinical performance. In bare-metal stents, Integrity BMS allowed us to take another 3 points of share this quarter in the U.S. ","Turning to Renal Denervation, we continue to make progress on this multi-billion opportunity in hypertension and expect to generate $35 million to $40 million of revenue in FY '12. On the commercial front, we introduced our SYMPLICITY system into new centers in Europe and Latin America, and remain focused on expanding reimbursement into additional countries. We also continue to make progress in our U.S. pivotal study and are tracking towards U.S. approval in FY '15.","Structural Heart revenue of $265 million increased 10%, driven by growth in transcatheter valves. We continue to split the TCV market with our competitor and have clear market leadership in transfemoral, the largest TCV segment. While the market in Europe was somewhat softer at the end of the calendar year, we continue to focus on deeper penetration in existing centers; access to new centers; new product introductions; and new access routes, including the subclavian and direct aortic approaches. Direct aortic had positive multicenter data at the STS conference and is becoming an attractive option for surgeons looking for an alternative to the transapical approach.","We are seeing strong interest in our new 31-millimeter CoreValve, which treats a patient population that previously could not be treated by transcatheter valves. And we expect to expand our offering with CE Mark approval of our 23-millimeter CoreValve this spring. In the U.S., we are pleased with the progress of our CoreValve pivotal trial. Enrollment in the extreme-risk arm is complete and we continue to enroll these patients through continued access. We expect to finish enrollment in our high-risk arm this summer.","Turning to Endovascular and Peripheral. Revenue of $190 million grew 17%. In the U.S., revenue growth of 25% was driven by the continued success of the Endurant abdominal stent graft. We have now anniversaried the launch of this product and would expect more moderate growth in Q4. Late in Q3, we received CE Mark approval for Endurant II, our next-generation AAA stent graft, which we expect will solidify our position as the market leader in the space. In peripheral, strong clinical data was presented earlier this month for our complete SE SFA, and we expect to receive an SFA indication in the U.S. later this summer. In drug-eluting balloons, we continue to post strong double-digit growth in Europe, and we continue to make progress on bringing this technology to the U.S.","Now turning to our Restorative Therapies group. Revenue of $1,889,000,000 grew 1%. Growth was driven by solid performance in Surgical Technologies, Diabetes and Neuromodulations, offset by continuing challenges in Spine. Spine revenue of $784 million declined 10%. In core Spine, which includes core metal constructs, IPDs and BKP products, revenue of $596 million declined 6%. Core metal construct products declined 5%. The global core market remains challenged and slowed sequentially, with year-over-year growth now in the low-single digits.  The U.S. market is also declining in the low-single digits, with mid-single digit pricing declines offsetting low-single digit procedure and mix growth.","We have a number of initiatives underway to improve our performance, including the upcoming launch of POWEREASE, training surgeons on our new MAST MIDLF procedure, continuing to offer differentiated navigated spine surgery solution, as well as the continued rollout of Solera. While sales of Solera are growing at 10% and garnering a double-digit price uplift, we still have less than half of the total sets in the field today. However, we continue to roll out new sets including the 5.5, 6.0 larger rod diameters to treat complex spine and deformity, the portion of our product line most affected by competitive offerings. Over the coming quarters, we expect Solera to become over 40% of our core metal revenue mix, which should help to drive improvement in our spine performance.","BKP revenues declined 7%. We have now posted sequentially flat results for 3 quarters in a row, which is relatively encouraging given the declines we have seen in this business over the past several years. In the U.S., we are seeing a modest uptick in BKP procedure volumes and our new products, including the recent launch of the Xpander 2, balloon appear to be stabilizing price. ","Biologics revenue of $188 million declined 20% in the quarter. BMP sales declined 26% in the quarter, including a 30% decline in the U.S. However, it is important to note that INFUSE is one of our lower margin products, muting its impact on our bottom line. Despite the increased pressure on INFUSE, we were encouraged to see double-digit growth in other biologics, including mid-teens growth in the U.S. We continue to see strong growth in our differentiated DBM offerings, including MagniFuse, a high-performance allograft formulation that was part of our Osteotech acquisition.","Turning to Neuromodulation. Revenue of $419 million increased 4%, led by double-digit growth in neurogastro. In pain, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for the RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator with our proprietary AdaptiveStim technology. We were unable to fully launch this product until the last week of the quarter due to a supply disruption resulting from the flooding in Thailand. This issue is now resolved and Q4 is off to a great start. We expect this breakthrough technology to drive growth and take share in the U.S. market.","In DBS, we continue to see very little impact from competition in international markets and we saw strong double-digit new patient growth in the U.S. In neurogastro, the U.S. launch of InterStim Therapy for bowel control continues to go well and is contributing to the success of InterStim.","Diabetes revenue of $367 million grew 8%, driven by double-digit growth in CGM. Our International Diabetes business grew 16% as we continue to see great adoption of our newest products in these markets. An example of this is our Enlite Sensor, which is driving very strong CGM growth in international markets, due to its improved comfort, accuracy and ease of use.","Surgical Technologies revenue of $319 million grew 22%, including $31 million from our Advanced Energy business, which is the combination of our acquisitions of PEAK and Salient. Our integration activities continue to go well, and Advanced Energy is now a $120 million business, growing double-digits on a pro forma basis. Excluding Advanced Energy, Surgical Technologies had strong organic growth of 10%, with solid performances across all businesses. We delivered another good performance in capital equipment, led by our Fusion navigation system for image-guided surgery and the S7 surgical navigation system. In addition, we continue to see robust sales of disposables, especially in ENT power and monitoring.","Turning to the rest of the income statement, I would like to note that my comments exclude the impact of Physio-Control. The gross margin was 76.2%, up 40 basis points from the third quarter of last year. While the gross margin did have a 30-basis-point benefit from FX, we continued to offset pricing pressure through our $1 billion cost of goods sold reduction program. We would expect our gross margin in Q4 to be in the range of 75.5% to 76%, which recognizes more of a negative impact from currency, as well as potential obsolescence of Endeavor, as we quickly ramp up the U.S. launch of Resolute Integrity.","Third quarter R&D spending of $364 million was 9.3% of revenue. We remain committed to investing in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth, and expect R&D spending to be approximately 9% of revenue in Q4. Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1,371,000,000 represented 35% of sales, which is a slight improvement year-over-year after adjusting for onetime executive separation cost last year. We expect Q4 SG&A in the range of 32.5% to 33% of revenue, which reflects the impact of several initiatives we are focusing on to leverage our expenses while at the same time investing in new product launches.","Amortization expense for the quarter was $84 million compared to $86 million in the third quarter last year. For Q4, we would expect amortization expense in the range of $80 million to $85 million. Net other expense for the quarter was $67 million, flat compared to the prior year. Net losses from our hedging programs were $33 million during the quarter. As you know, we hedge much of our operating results to reduce volatility in our earnings. Net other expense this quarter also includes $21 million in expense from the Puerto Rico excise tax, which is almost entirely offset by a corresponding tax benefit I will discuss in a moment. Net other expense this quarter was favorable to our expectations, driven by lower than expected payments of spine royalties and the Puerto Rico excise tax as a result of slower end market volumes.  Looking ahead, based on current FX rates, we anticipate Q4 net other expense will be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, including hedging losses in the range of $15 million to $20 million.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $33 million compared to $70 million in the prior-year period. Excluding the $21 million noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $12 million. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $9.4 billion in cash and cash investments and $10.2 billion of debt. For Q4, we anticipate non-GAAP net interest expense will be in the range of $20 million to $25 million.","Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our third quarter effective tax rate, as well as our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the third quarter was 19.8%. Included in this rate is an $18 million tax benefit associated with the U.S. foreign tax credit from the Puerto Rico excise tax, which mostly offsets the charge recorded in other expense. Exclusive of onetime adjustments, we expect our FY '12 adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19.5% to 20%, which includes the tax credit associated with the Puerto Rico excise tax. Our Q3 GAAP results included a onetime deferred tax benefit related to the estimated gain on the sale of Physio-Control. It is worth noting that the timing of the tax benefit does not correspond to the timing of the sale gain which will be recorded in Q4, but will not impact our non-GAAP earnings.","In Q3, we generated approximately $1 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Fiscal year-to-date we have paid $769 million in dividends and repurchased $780 million of our common stock. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 75 million shares. Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,060,000,000 shares. In Q4, we have already started our share buybacks to offset the dilution from our Physio-Control divestiture and have bought back over $400 million thus far.","Let me conclude by commenting on our revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance for the remainder of fiscal year 2012. This morning, we reiterated our revenue outlook and tightened our FY '12 earnings per share guidance. We believe a constant currency revenue growth rate of 1% to 3% remains reasonable. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates would remain similar to yesterday throughout Q4, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $20 million to $40 million.","Turning to our guidance on the bottom line. At this point in the year, we are comfortable tightening our earnings per share guidance range. We now expect FY '12 earnings per share in the range of $3.44 to $3.47, which after adjusting for $0.04 to $0.06 of dilution from the Ardian acquisition and $0.10 of onetime tax benefits we received in FY '11, implies FY '12 earnings per share growth of 7% to 8%. Based on our guidance, current FY '12 earnings per share consensus of $3.45 appears reasonable. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during Q4, nor do they include the impact of the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.","Finally, one housekeeping item. We will be hosting our annual institutional investor and analyst meeting this year on the morning of Friday, June 1. The meeting this year will be held in New York City. ","With that, Omar and I would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Start with you Omar. In the opening comments you sounded less optimistic, at least near term, on Spine versus ICDs. And when you look at Spine, the issue that's really been hampering the U.S. businesses, the \u2013 a lot of it's the pods. I mean, if they're allowed to continue operating as they are today, is it realistic to believe you can turn this business with technology in the next 12 to 18 months?","Omar S. Ishrak","Well, look, first of all the pods are still a small segment, a small portion of the overall revenue. Although clearly, they're meaningfully affecting our overall share. Now if the pod gains -- continues to gain critical mass and becomes bigger and bigger, then we've got to understand what that operating -- that business model is and understand it more clearly, because right now, it's coming under increasingly negative public scrutiny. We don't think some of those practices are appropriate and, therefore, we don't do such things. Now if it becomes really big, then that means that there's some level of acceptance, in which case we need to re-examine our business model in that area and change our strategy. But clearly, if it gets really big, it's something we have to pay attention to.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, And then just one quick follow-up for Gary. On the ICD business in the U.S., there's going to be a lot of questions on that. Just quickly on the O.U.S., can you say where the market's slowing internationally? Is it Europe or Japan in your view?","Gary L. Ellis","I think what our data would say is that's primarily in Europe. And by -- but even there I would say, Matt, it's probably in Southern Europe more than anything.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Corporation","Just first a clarification. Gary, on the quarter you reported $0.84. How much did Physio contribute to that $0.84 in the quarter?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, I think the quarter was, $15 million was the profits from operations that were included in that number. So as we expected all year, I mean, the Physio acquisition obviously was complete or the sale was completed here in the beginning of our fourth quarter. Our expectation was that results for the first 3 quarters, obviously, are in our guidance and in our results. And then for Q4 here, our expectation is, as we talked about, is that we will be buying back stock to offset the impact of not having that profits in our numbers. So overall, the impact was, from operations, that's in the $0.84 is about $15 million. The gain, the tax gain that we're backing that out, that's a nonrecurring item.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Corporation","Okay. And then a follow-up question on Spine. It seems like your commentary is basically suggesting to us that we've seen the lows in your Spine growth. And you, obviously that business shrank 10% this quarter. But you made an interesting comment that things in the last month of the quarter looked better. So can you quantify that for us? How much better were things in that final month? What was the year-over-year growth rate in the final month given that you called it out, and just love to talk a little bit more about spine.","Gary L. Ellis","I don't \u2013 Bob, this is Gary. I don't even have the absolute number in my mind as far as where the month is. I know that trend-wise, just from seeing the data, we saw improvement as we went through January and the average daily revenue, that it was improving. Now it was still down obviously, so it wasn't -- we're not saying that it was growing during that period of time, but the decline versus the prior year was much less and we saw that improving in Q3, and we've seen that so far even as we went through here in Q4. And the biggest part of that was actually both on core metal and also INFUSE. As Omar said in his comments, the biggest impact from INFUSE, being declined, we actually -- it was stronger in November and December. It was somewhat less of a decline in January, and we've seen that little bit here even as we start our Q4. That being said, the business is still down, it's just not down as much as, obviously, we saw here in Q3.","Omar S. Ishrak","I think the comments that I made on that was primarily around the fact that if the decline stabilizes, which is what we've been seeing, then at some point in the coming quarters the comparisons versus prior year will become favorable. And that's really -- and we are optimistic that, that will in fact happen. Now INFUSE is its own thing here, because that has different dynamics and that can lead to uncertainty at any time, until we get this Yale study resolved.","Robert A. Hopkins - Bank of America Corporation","At then what was core metal down x Kyphon in the quarter?","Gary L. Ellis","For worldwide, it was mid-single digits.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, I wonder if you can give us a little more granularity on gross margins. It was, obviously, the strongest quarter we've seen in basically 6 quarters, and I know there's some currency give-and-takes as well as some divestitures. But it looks like some of that strength will carry forward in the next quarter, and your gross margin guidance for the year probably comes at the higher end of the range. So can you just help us understand maybe as you look back over the last 4 quarters, what's driving the GM strength, and do you think some of those trends are sustainable?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, yes. First of all, I mean, I want to make sure it's clear that, obviously, the gross margin we're talking about excludes Physio; which Physio, pulling that out actually improves the overall gross margin for the company by -- it'll vary by quarter, but say 50 basis points approximately overall. So that just ratchets everything up. Now that being said, you're absolutely right. Even with that, the last several quarters, we've been holding relatively steady on the gross margins. And we do expect that, that will continue as we go into the fourth quarter here. We have been able to offset the pricing pressures we've seen in the marketplace with, obviously, introducing new products that are seeing our pricing pressure probably less than even what's going on in the market. We mentioned that in CRDM and even in some cases, even in some of the Spine products. With these new products, we are seeing some price uplifts. That's obviously helping us. But the main thing, I think, is obviously the differentiator for Medtronic has been the fact that we've been -- the cost out. We've been taking $1 billion of cost out of our product cost over the last 5 years. We have objectives to continue to do that going forward and have laid out the plans. And so it has been our expectation that we're going to -- that we can maintain these gross margins even in this tight pricing environment. And so that is our expectations. I did highlight in my comments that, in Q4, the positive FX benefit is not quite strong as what we've seen over the last several quarters. So that's why we were a little bit more cautious in our guidance here for Q4.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up. I know it's too early to think about fiscal '13 guidance. But just basically taking Omar's comments, as well as some of your comments, Gary, is it sort of reasonable to assume as we head into fiscal '13, we see non-ICD Spine performance sort of where it's been, a slight improvement in ICD spine performance? And do you remain kind of reasonably comfortable this remains a upper-single-digit EPS growth business?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. Again, we're not obviously giving guidance for FY '13 yet, David. And we will do that, obviously, in the May discussion. But, I mean, I think the comment with respect to Spine and ICDs is even applicable as we -- based on Omar's comments and mine even as we get into Q4 here. We do believe that these markets are starting to stabilize and as a result, the comparisons for us get easier as we kind of get into some of the next quarters here, Q4 and into FY '13. And if our other businesses continue to do well, which they should especially the new product launches of Resolute Integrity, RestoreSensor, et cetera, we should see those businesses continue to perform strongly, that, that would start to have an impact on improvement in our overall revenue growth. And from there, then we'll clearly continue to focus on driving and delivering the bottom line, that's a few percentage points faster than the top line. That'll be our expectation as we go into the future years, as we've talked about previously. But we're not giving guidance yet, as far as what that revenue or earnings per share for FY '13 is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just first a clarification, Omar or Gary. The third quarter non-GAAP $0.84 you reported. You announced on the last quarter call that you would call out Physio-Control as a discontinued operation. You did not include it in revenues this quarter, but you are including the EPS benefit in the $0.84?","Gary L. Ellis","That is correct, Mike. This is Gary. As we did, and as you recall last quarter, we didn't know exactly when the deal would close and we've been, obviously, including Physio all year in our guidance along -- as we went forward. We did highlight the fact that, once we did saw it, we thought we could offset the profit loss by buying back stock. But obviously until we actually have the acquisition closed, we couldn't buy back stock to offset that. So the assumption is, is the operating results from Physio, their operating earnings are in our results but the revenue, because it is a discontinued operation, does not show above the line. We did, in the press release and in our comments here, we did try to highlight what the revenue from Physio was, just so people would have an understanding of that. But that's how we've done it. So the operations are in our guidance, none of the gain, none of the gain aspect related to selling of the asset will be included in the results. But clearly, the operations were.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Let me move forward then, 2 items. So one, Gary, should we assume, given the commitment to return the 50% of free cash flow to shareholders and the need to rebalance your U.S. versus O.U.S. cash generation, that the tax rate, underlying tax rate for the company moves higher from here in FY '13 and 14?","Gary L. Ellis","Mike, we don't know for sure how -- what's going to happen on that. We're obviously trying to do things to not impact the tax rate. Our first things are, obviously, looking at -- Omar has a lot of initiatives out underway on working capital to reduce inventory levels, to improve our focus on capital expenditures. So focusing on areas where we can try to improve the cash mix, without -- from an operating perspective, without actually addressing it from a tax side equation. We are doing the analysis, as we indicated in some of the recent presentations. We are doing some analysis to say what if we did repatriate certain earnings from certain countries, and what would that do to the overall tax rate. Because some countries obviously have tax rates that are closer to the U.S. and there's a minimal impact in that regard. So we have not made any assumptions right now. We have not made any decisions in that regard. And I don't know what the tax rate for -- I can expect for FY '13 will be. But if we have to meaningfully do some things in that regard, yes, you could see a slight uptick in the tax rate. But obviously, we're going to try to minimize that to the extent we can. So we're trying to do this without addressing that aspect currently and we'll see how successful we are prior to going to the tax rate.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then last question, and maybe this is one just for Omar, but whoever can jump in here. Can you just talk about the pipelines at both CoreValve and Ardian? I think there's some increased concern that competitors are really targeting this product specifically and that they'll introduce products that could potentially leapfrog either of them in Europe in 2013. So could you just give us a better sense of what is in the pipeline for both of those product lines?","Omar S. Ishrak","Look, let me take a shot and then let Gary also talk about it. First of all, our investment strategy in both those product lines are pretty high. I mean we are determined to maintain leadership and will maintain leadership by investing in technologies, by creating our own leapfrog technologies which we've got in our own pipeline, in both of those areas, as well as driving getting enhanced clinical data through increasing the number of indications. So in both of those areas, those are priority investments for us. And I'm telling you that we're determined to keep our lead, we're not going to give this thing up.","Gary L. Ellis","Yes, Mike, I can add a little bit. I mean, I think -- I don't have all the details on the product technology in either one of those. But Omar is absolutely right, we continue to invest. CoreValve, obviously, as I had my comments where there's several different things. We're obviously expanding the number of sizes that are in the marketplace, which will broaden the market. We are, obviously, coming at it from a different approach, the direct aortic approach versus the transapical. We continue to look at new delivery systems, TISA has a recapture built into it. So there's a lot of different things that are being done on CoreValve to enhance the product line overall. And so we believe that we'll be very, very competitive in that marketplace as we have been, obviously, up to this point in time. Ardian, the same thing. The reality is, obviously, those products are just being launched. There are several new technologies that we're taking with, along with what we acquired from Ardian, and the business unit has several different technologies that we'll probably be able to discuss a little bit more at the Analyst Meeting in June and walk you through, for both these businesses, kind of where we're at. But Omar is absolutely right. We are continuing to invest very heavily in these businesses, in new technology that will actually be second-, third-generation types of products.","Omar S. Ishrak","And then maybe one other point on that. We've got a breadth of technologies across Medtronic. And we've got -- our CBG business has a pretty dedicated focus in making sure that technologies that are available in one business are translated to another, to give us increased competitiveness. And that's not a minor advantage, that's something that we will leverage as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I was just wondering, Omar, if you could just comment on whether, with several months under the belt now, if there's anything that you see that really changes more of the strategic direction of the company?","Omar S. Ishrak","Well, a number of things. First of all, I laid out the key areas for focus for us, which I've talked about many times: Improving execution, optimizing innovation and accelerating globalization. Right now, I'm focused on still collecting data, but more so, operationalizing these areas. And as we operationalize them, I'm finding that these are, in fact, the right things to do. We need even more detail in each of those areas. The focus on economic value, I find incredibly important in this environment. And partnerships with major U.S. providers, and also understanding the bare ramifications of customer economic value, are things that are very important. And if anything, the importance of this has been highlighted to me even further in the last few months. And globalization, the thing for me that was new in the past 3 to 4 months was the realization of how much an opportunity there is in the [indiscernible] with our existing therapies around the world. That's just a stunning number. And based on that, one of the areas that actually has changed is a higher priority in finding ways to make sure that these existing therapies are adequately penetrated in these emerging markets. And then taking a step back on the value segment and approaching that with a little more time, it gives us a little more time to address the value segment and I think that's appropriate. So I think minor tweaks or whatever perspective you may have on it, major or minor tweaks to the overall strategies, which I think I are right ones. Execution is critically important, and again, our productivity in terms of R&D spending is very high in my list and I think using customer economic value as a central point in our investment criteria is important, and I just talked about globalization. I think these 3 are the pillars that we're building our operations around. And as we go forward, we're fine-tuning them and operationalizing them to a fair amount of granular detail.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then at the Annual Investor Conference, will you give longer-term guidance or will it just be for fiscal 13?","Gary L. Ellis","This is Gary. We haven't, obviously, decided yet what we'll do on that. But my guess, at this point in time, is that it'll probably just be for FY '13. But we'll have to decide. I mean, it gets back to how comfortable we are where the markets are at, to be honest with you. The market volatility has been probably the biggest issue for us over the last few years which, obviously, gives us concern about giving long-term guidance, just not knowing exactly where the markets are at. So we haven't decided yet, we'll see where we're at the analyst meeting. Obviously, we'll be at that -- by that point, we'll have given guidance for FY '13. Whether we're providing longer-term guidance will depend on whether we see our markets fully stabilizing.","Omar S. Ishrak","And also, how quantitatively we can understand the impact of some our initiatives, which that's not the necessarily that simple. But we will try to give you as much data as possible and be as quantitative as we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just want to ask one clarification question on the CoreValve trial, whether you could file separately for the extreme-risk indication or whether you had to file the high-risk and extreme-risk together and what, then, that meant for approval for each indication?","Gary L. Ellis","David, this is Gary. From what I understand is that we can file each one of them separate. And so that, basically, with the extreme-risk arm, obviously, enrollment done and once we have all the results that, that can be filed separately without having the high-risk.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one follow-up for Omar and then one for you, Gary. Over the past couple quarters, it sounds like your willingness to look toward divesting businesses or reassessing kind of the strategic portfolio at Medtronic has become a little bit more flexible than when you first presented to us back in August and this time, in your prepared remarks, you cited Spine. Maybe just elaborate a little more what specifically you're waiting for to look at other strategic alternatives for Spine or businesses where the opportunities for innovation or incremental growth just aren't there. And then for Gary, how should we start thinking about the med-tech tax, which you'll be one of the first companies to present that in your guidance for fiscal '13 and what initiatives are you undertaking to offset the dilution from that required expense?","Omar S. Ishrak","Okay. First, a clarification on what I mean by reassess strategy. I mean sure, inorganic alternatives of all sorts exist. But I'm going to look at organic alternatives as well. Reassess the way in which we're growing our Spine business. Things don't work for several quarters or certain strategies not delivering the results we expect, you've got to do some things different, but organic alternatives are also absolutely our cards. I think I made it clear a few months ago, the way in which we're looking at our whole portfolio, and not only at the major business level but within these businesses, is essentially look at each of the sub-businesses that we have and ask 3 questions: Are we in an attractive market? Do we have a team -- do we feel that we have the capability to win in that attractive market? And by win, I mean, can we become a leader? And three, what is the overall value that Medtronic adds to that specific business? And quantify that as much as possible. These are the 3 questions we intend to ask for every sub-business we have in our portfolio. And we're, today, putting the processes in place to do this in a consistent and as quantitative a manner as we can. And based on that analysis, which we will perform periodically, maybe 2x a year, we will make decisions. And those decisions will guide the nature of our portfolio. So I want to be as consistent and logical about this as possible with a view towards a clear and consistent long-term strategy, as opposed to a knee-jerk, what happened in the last few months or whatever, because we're here for the long term. And we've got to make the right decisions that favor the long-term benefit for Medtronic and our ability to participate in growth markets and win in those markets and also add value from our breadth. So that's the process that we're embarking on and we'll probably share with you a few more details, at least on the process, at the investors meeting and more importantly will put it in place as we go forward.","Gary L. Ellis","David, just back to the question on the medical device tax. Obviously, we're still, as all companies are, still working on understanding the exact impact of this. And you're correct, we'll be one of the first ones that will include that in our guidance because we'll have 4 months of it in our FY '13 results. It's still only draft regulations out there at this point in time. But our expectation, based on what we are seeing and hearing, is that the net impact of this is probably about $125 million to $175 million for us per year. So in FY '13, you could assume there could be about a $40 million to $60 million impact for 1\/3 kind of, of that year overall. We're obviously looking, the businesses and ourselves, we're looking at a lot of different ways to figure out how much of that, if any, can we pass on. How do we offset the cost associated with that. So we've looked at this basically one of the costs we're going to have to cover as we put together our plans for FY '13, and as we put together our initiatives on a long-term basis. This is just a cost of -- it's going to be a cost of doing business here in the U.S. and we're going to have to make the trade-offs and there's probably going to be things that we can't do as a result of that. But our assumption is this is a cost that we're going to have to incur.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Gary, one clarification. Were those numbers that you gave for the med-tech tax before or after tax?","Gary L. Ellis","Those were after tax, Larry.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Let me focus first on the transcatheter valve market. Gary, you mentioned a slowdown in -- outside the U.S. in your fiscal third quarter. Could you talk about what you saw there? Was it new competitors? Was it pricing? And did you see a pickup in January? I mean, was this kind of just temporary due to budget in Europe? That's my first question.","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. Larry, our sense is it's primarily -- it was more procedure-related than anything and it's primarily just because of the capitated budgets that many of the countries in Europe, obviously, deal with. And so what our sales force would tell us and what we saw was -- the data would tell us was they actually saw a little bit of a slowdown, it's just these budgets were fully utilized and so you saw a reduction in procedures. And also, especially in some of the -- I think it was more, again, in Southern Europe versus even the Northern European countries. So we're not saying that we -- we don't think the market's going to completely slowdown or not going to come back, but clearly because of the capitated budgets and the fact that they were just completely used into the calendar year, we saw it slow down a little bit. It was still growing but, obviously, a little bit slower growth.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I mean some of the other markets you talked about a pickup in January. Are you willing to talk -- did you see a pickup in that market in January or does that slowdown continue?","Gary L. Ellis","I don't know if the slowdown continued. I wouldn't say it bounced back as much as we saw in some of the other businesses, which we tend to see more often. For example, this happens in a lot of our product lines, whether it's pacing or ICDs, it's not just transcatheter valves. But I would say that we probably saw that bounce back a little bit more in some of those other markets. That might be just due to the fact that those are more mature businesses and the hospitals know to handle that. We don't know, but we didn't see, necessarily, a bounce back in the growth rates in January yet.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And lastly, Gary, in the U.S. there were some concern about increased seasonality in calendar year Q4  2011. It sounds like, in the U.S., you didn't see a drop-off in January due to increased seasonality, is that fair?","Gary L. Ellis","No. I don't -- we didn't see anything, really, from a seasonality in January for our purpose. I mean, I think historically we have a couple of businesses and that there is a little bit of a seasonality that comes into a case because of the higher deductibles, et cetera, that people will all of a sudden be getting into. So for example, our Diabetes business always sees November, December being a little bit stronger and January is a little bit softer historically. But the comparisons year-over-year, I mean, we saw the same growth. But that's kind of a normal phenomenon that we'll see. They see a little bit more seasonality than probably our other businesses because of that deductible issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe just, I apologize, the question has been asked a lot about the strategy and just thinking out longer term, and appreciate all of the details you guys have given. But with respect to just the portfolio, a lot of the questions were about maybe thinking about selling off businesses and you talked about your thought process in terms of looking at the markets and looking at whether you could win. But think about it slightly different I guess, in terms some of these businesses being high-growth businesses that Medtronic could create significant shareholder value, and maybe some of these segments could trade at 5x to 6x revenue stand-alone public entities. So you're not selling those businesses, but clearly just creating value where maybe now you're not getting full value for some of the higher growth segments. So I guess how are you thinking about that in terms of just the thought process? And do you think you're getting fair value for some of the higher growth segments?","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. I think that's what I was tried to address when I said looking at the overall value of Medtronic. So we're going through a fairly granular and quantitative approach where we're really looking at each of our businesses, high-growth and not. Where we're seeing \u2013 where we're assessing, what are the unique aspects of being part of Medtronic. In other words, very clearly, are there technologies that we have in one business that we can transfer over to another business, that's unique to Medtronic and our portfolio of products? So that makes a value that we are providing that the business, on its own, would not have. Are there areas where we've taken technologies and actually created new products, which are linked in front of the customer? And so the physician practitioner actually uses 2 of our technologies together in a way that's unique? Or do we have plans to create such products which, again, for a company on its own would have difficulty doing? Do we have operational and simply, cost synergies that are strong and provide extreme value from a profitability and reinvestment perspective for that company. So we look at a fairly granular set of criteria, and the 4 or 5 such criteria, which we want to look at by sub-business within our portfolio, and in a consistent fashion, grade that. And if at any time we find that the, overall, Medtronic is not adding enough value to that sub-business and that business can be better off in its own, then that becomes a candidate for divestiture, absolutely. By the way, the same rationale we expect to apply for acquisitions. So the way in which we do acquisitions also quantify and see their fit with Medtronic and what we can add. So those questions apply to our entire inorganic strategy.","Gary L. Ellis","Just to give you an example. I mean, with the Physio-Control divestiture, we're just in process of going through, obviously. I would say Physio-Control is probably the farthest removed of all our businesses. And I would tell you, as we go through this process, it's surprising how much we learn where there are more synergies than we even ourselves understand. And so Omar's point of going back, we're finding out there were a lot more cost synergies than we expected, et cetera. And so it's more difficult that you envision just to go out and especially divest of business onto itself if there's not someone there with the infrastructure to support it going forward. So we have to understand all that aspects of it. But it's not just a cost component, as Omar indicated, it's also back to all the technology and the customer relationships and what that means. But we are going through this in a very systematic approach across every one of our products.","Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate the detailed response. And maybe just a quick follow-up. So based on that, as you think about selling to the hospitals, in terms of selling bundled products and just the opportunity there. Just curious, in terms of just how do you see hospital purchasing going in the future and certainly having that broader portfolio? Just your thoughts there.","Omar S. Ishrak","The broader portfolio, obviously, helps there. But look, that is not the only factor, like I mentioned earlier. In fact, if we can use technology in some way, it's actually a far more differentiated approach from our competition in many ways. However, the fact that we have a breath of our products to a hospital is clearly an advantage. And we think that, in the U.S., hospitals, by and large, will be looking at that much more expansively than they've been before. In my discussions with different CEOs, there's considerable interest in partnerships with Medtronic, primarily so that we can create economic value for the hospital together through the technologies that we have. They realize that for the hospitals to run efficiency and profitably, they need to partner with broad technology providers and solution providers which -- and we're pretty good candidate for that. And by the way, that's true outside the U.S. as well. It has been the case in Europe for a while, where hospitals look at companies from a much broader perspective. And certainly, in some of the emerging markets as well, as hospitals are being set up, the administrative management of the hospital usually looks to companies who have a breadth of offerings. So we think that that's an advantage, but I do want to point out that's not the only advantage, by any means. I think the technology advantage and the customer focus advantage where the physician-focused advantage are, in many ways, even greater than the bundling opportunity. But like I said, that cannot be minimized here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Michelmore with Brean Murray.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Maybe a question on the Diabetes business. It did look like the U.S. business there had taken a step down from the last quarter. So wondering if there's anything going on there. And was also looking for an update, I know you have a lot of new products internationally that have helped the growth rate there and what the status is in terms of getting those products to the U.S. market.","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. This is Gary. The U.S. revenue, with the Diabetes business, grew about 3% in the quarter and so it was, obviously, below what we've seen in international. And that's not unusual, we've seen that over the last several quarters. Our international growth has been more than in the U.S. But you're right, it was a little bit softer this quarter. Little bit, we saw a little bit slower pump growth at the end of the year here. And overall, CGM and everything else was doing fine, but the pump growth was a little bit slower than what we expected. We don't think there's any big issue there, we just think it's more due to the slowing economy. I mean, the economy still has an impact on this business and we think that's part of the issue that we saw here in the U.S. overall. So we're not expecting a long-term trend in that regard. But I think you're going to continue to see the U.S. being a little softer, obviously, than the international market where we do have all the new products. Now with respect to the new products coming to the U.S., both -- and I'm assuming you're talking about really, Veo, which is the low-glucose suspend feature, and the Enlite, which is our new sensor, we're working with the FDA on that right now. We're making good progress on the IDE for the U.S. Enlite product. And we're continuing to have conversations with the FDA on working to get Veo into the marketplace overall. So we're excited about getting those products to the marketplace as quickly as possible. But that's still a ways out.","Sara Michelmore - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on the Restore product in the U.S. Is there any way to quantitate what you think that cost you in the quarter? And was interested what your latest thinking was in terms of the growth of the pain market in the U.S.?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, as we said, I mean I think the pain market in the U.S. from our data, which we think is kind of growing the mid-single digits overall. We obviously did not have the Restore sensor, really, even though it was approved, we weren't really able to launch it fully until, as I had indicated in my comments, until the very last week in the quarter. We had a supply issue on some of the components in the products coming from Thailand. So that really hampered our ability to launch the product fully in Q3, and if anything, probably actually hurt us because you had people waiting to get that new product. The good news is that, that is resolved. We have launched those products fully now in Q4. And the business is off to a very good start. So we expect we are going to gain share back with the Restore sensor and starting here in Q4.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Two parts. One, you talk about inventory management of ICDs by the hospitals. Are we at the end of that? And then the second piece of it is, if I heard in there directly, you talked about minimizing dilution from M&A. Did I hear that correctly? And if so, have you have changed your strategy for M&A?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, let me take the first one and then Omar can take the dilution question. With respect to the destocking comments and the just inventory levels overall, Joanne, what I would say is I think this fluctuates. I mean, as we've indicated before, about 5% of our revenue or about 20% of the CRDM revenue was kind of in bulk purchases that we have with hospitals. And that's going to fluctuate 10%, plus or minus, kind of in any given quarter. And we saw it was lower this quarter for ourselves. I mean, I think the competitors mentioned somewhat of the same thing in some of their comments. So I mean now is it in a new low or could that continue? I don't think any of us know for sure. But that's going to, obviously, be up to hospitals and what kind of situation they are in their inventory levels overall. So it's a kind of a normal fluctuation that occurs in our markets. The good news for us is the implants, the daily implants, as we indicated in our comments in Q3 and here in Q4, continuing to grow and sequentially grow and are actually up over the prior year, as we indicated in our comments. So that ultimately has to have an impact on where those inventory levels are at. So from our perspective, that's where we focus and then the inventory levels are going to fluctuate depending on what the hospitals want to do.","Omar S. Ishrak","On the dilution question, look, to put this in perspective, Medtronic has done several major acquisitions in the past few years which have been dilutive. Now these have been good deals. They are strategic for us. They in many ways can change the way in which medicines perform and are appropriate for us. However, it takes time for us to realize the benefits that these deals have promised. And we're in the middle of realizing those benefits, they're in plan but they take time. In the meantime, our organic growth has slowed. As so to do more dilutive deals without any real discipline around it, obviously, doesn't make any sense. So at this stage, what we have in our portfolio, our focus is to translate the deals that we've already done into real benefits, to realize the benefits that were promised, and we need to demonstrate that to our shareholders and for us. And at the same time, we're willing to look at other attractive deals, which may well have dilution. But if they have dilution, then we need to find offsets in the business to fund them. I think, again, there are always exceptions to this, so I don't want to make any hard and fast rules here. But our general direction here is that, I really don't want any significant dilution from any inorganic activity in the near term and that doesn't mean that the deal itself cannot be dilutive. But if it is, then the business, either by itself or collectively, Medtronic has to find an appropriate offset.","Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. If I can follow up quickly. Physio-Control will add how much to gross margins on a go-forward basis, the sale of that?","Gary L. Ellis","What we've vindicated, I think, it varies by quarter obviously, depending where we're at. But you're talking somewhere around 50, 60 basis points.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session. I hand the program back over to Mr. Omar Ishrak for closing remarks.","Omar S. Ishrak","Okay. Thank you. Thanks for your questions. And before I end today's call, I would like to comment on Medtronic's ability to play a leadership role in the changing healthcare environment. And I've touched some of this in the Q&A, but let me just summarize. ","In the few quarters that I've been at Medtronic, it has become clear to me that a large shift is occurring in our industry that goes straight to the core of our industry's business model. Med-tech has tried for decades by engaging primarily with the physician, who in most instances evaluated the merits of our products solely on their clinical value. While clinical value and our physician-customers will always remain important, there are additional decision factors and decision-makers that are playing an expanded role in the purchase of med-tech products and services. This has significant ramifications for our industry, and Medtronic is focused on modifying our strategies to align all the activities in our value chain to this new environment. This affects selecting the products and services that we choose to develop, capturing additional evidence and the economic value of our portfolio, modifying how we market our products and services, adapting the structural skill set of our sales force, and optimizing our operational efficiency. Change is never easy. And while not all companies will be able to evolve, there will always be winners and losers in any environment. Our breadth and our customer relationships are unique advantages that allow us to deliver value to the overall healthcare system, and we will emerge stronger, leading our industry in providing better and more cost-effective solutions to many more people around the globe. ","With that, and on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator instructions.]  I would now like to turn today\u2019s call over to your host, Jeff Warren, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Warren","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic\u2019s chairman and chief executive officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s chief financial officer,  will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter fiscal year 2013, which ended April 26, 2013. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. ","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full year 2013, respectively, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff.  And thank you to everyone for joining us today.  This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion, which represents growth of 5%.  Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $1.124 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.10 increased 8% and 11%, respectively.","These results were a strong finish to a solid fiscal year, and more importantly, represented another step toward our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth.  Our performance was broad-based, with many businesses and geographies making significant contributions to our overall growth.  In the second half of the fiscal year, we delivered 4.4% revenue growth, which was consistent with the model we shared at the beginning of the calendar year.","This quarter, our revenue exceeded our outlook, which contributed to a portion of the earnings upside, the details of which we will discuss later.  We recognize that every quarter may not be a perfect fit on our trend line because of a variety of reasons, but the most important outcome for me is that we are establishing a track record of consistency.  We\u2019re still in the process of continuing to strengthen and geographically diversify our businesses so that we can reliably deliver balanced and consistent growth.","Looking back at FY13, I\u2019m proud of the work that our approximately 4,500 employees around the world have accomplished.   We improved our top line performance for the second consecutive year, delivering 5% growth, which exceeded our original revenue outlook.  We maintained our market share in almost all of our businesses while delivering SG&A leverage.  Our FY13 non-GAAP EPS grew 300 basis points [faster than] revenue, and we generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow.  ","And while these financial metrics are important, they come as a result of living our mission, partnering with our physician and administrative customers every day to bring our cost-effective and life-saving innovations to millions of patients around the globe.","Over the last several quarters, I\u2019ve discussed the importance of stabilizing our U.S. ICD, U.S. Core Spine, and U.S. patient businesses, which represent nearly a quarter of our total revenue.  Combined, these three businesses were flat in Q4, with two of the three businesses, U.S. ICD and U.S. Core Spine not only stabilizing but actually growing 2%.  This is especially significant as Q4 was the first quarter in four and a half years where both of these businesses grew concurrently.","Gary will walk you through the details later, but this is noteworthy, especially since these businesses have been significant impediments to our overall growth profile.  In fact, we\u2019re optimistic that this stabilization will continue as we roll out our new products.  ","Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for our next generation [high powered] devices, and I was encouraged by the positive feedback I heard from customers on these products when I recently attended HRS.  ","U.S. pacing, however, declined 6% as the overall market continues to be affected by both lengthening replacement cycles and lower initial implant rates.  While our U.S. pacing business was in line with the market, it is not recovering as [unintelligible] expected earlier this calendar year.  This in clear contrast to the international pacing market, which is growing, and where we gained share.","Looking ahead, we believe our Advisa MRI pacemaker, which is doing extremely well in Japan and is now being introduced in the U.S., will lead to improved performance despite the slow market.","The remaining three quarters of our business continued to deliver solid performance, growing a combined 6% in Q4.  In the cardiac and vascular group, we outperformed the market, driven by several areas of strength.   In CRDM, the ongoing European launch of our new family of high powered devices and the second generation of [unintelligible] continues to go well.  These products have led to sequential pricing and share improvement in Europe and our share is now at its highest level in over two years.  ","In pacing, our international business grew 13%, led by an outstanding performance in Japan.  The Japanese market has clearly embraced our Advisa MRI product family, resulting in over 11 points of pacemaker share gains since launch.","In coronary, we grew by leading global stent share in the quarter, driven by the ongoing success of the Resolute Integrity drug eluting stent.  Structural heart and endovascular also had very strong performances in Q4 as we continue to offer differentiated new technology in transcatheter valves, aortic stent grafts, peripheral vascular products, and cardiac surgery oxygen [unintelligible].  ","In many ways, our [CBG] organization strategy to continuously enhance the technology and economic value oriented service offerings, to streamline its customer presence, and to leverage its collective strength for value continues to be evaluated.  This has meaningfully contributed to our ability to outperform the market in recent quarters.  We\u2019re taking our [CBG] approach even deeper, combining our CRDM and coronary U.S. district managers into a single cardiology-focused leadership structure that will better align our [CBG] solutions to the changing customer.","Now, let\u2019s switch to the restorative therapies group, where our performance was equally impressive in Q4.  In Core Spine, in addition to the growth in the U.S. that I mentioned earlier, we also continued to improve our share.  We attribute the share gain to our new, innovative products and therapies across our spine portfolio.  We\u2019re also differentiating our spine business from the competition through enabling technologies from our surgical technologies business including imaging, navigation, and powered surgical instruments.","Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery as they see clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures.  This shows up not only in increased revenue and share for our spinal implant, but also in the strong capital equipment performance in our surgical technologies business.  We believe we\u2019re still only on the leading edge of this large, differentiated opportunity in spine.","In [BMP], while our Q4 revenues declined 1%, it is encouraging to note that on a sequential basis this business has been relatively stable throughout FY13 after adjusting for bulk sales.  We are awaiting the publication of systematic reviews of Infuse commissioned by Yale University\u2019s Open Data Access Project.  According to Yale\u2019s public communication, the results are anticipated to be published in June.","In neuromodulation, both DBS and InterStim had strong performances as our consistent focus and market development and evidence generation is paying off.  Surgical technologies delivered another outstanding quarter with advanced energy growing in excess of 20%.  And neurosurgery, driven by continued adoption of imaging and navigation [unintelligible], posting double digit growth.  ","In diabetes, we had solid midteens international growth in Q4, where we have new products approved.  In the U.S., however, the diabetes business continues to face near term pressure as we await FDA approval of our MiniMed 530G.  In fact, U.S. diabetes, which contributes nearly $1 billion in revenue, did not growth in FY13.  But we expect it to quickly return to faster growth once our new system is approved.   ","Let me now discuss our performance on a regional basis.  The U.S. showed some encouraging signs, growing 3% in both the quarter and the year, representing the first full year of growth in the U.S. in three years.  ","In our international regions, revenue was up 7% again this quarter, driven principally by Japan and emerging markets.  It is worth noting that our international regions have grown between 6% and 8% for 11 quarters in a row, which is the type of consistent and balanced performance that we are looking for across geographies.  ","In western Europe and Canada, we returned to growth again this quarter, an improvement from our decline last quarter, driven primarily by CRT-D products and CRDM.  And while our results in Europe were better than last quarter, the market conditions across different businesses and countries remains complex.  ","Our team is navigating through these dynamics for potential growth opportunities using innovation as well as our breadth and scale to partner with different stakeholders.  Looking ahead, however, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious about European expectations given these somewhat uncertain market conditions.  ","Japan had another strong quarter, up 19% in Q4, where a number of our newly launched products are driving growth.  In addition to the Advisa MRI pacemaker I mentioned earlier, our Resolute Integrity DES gained 2 points of market share sequentially and our Endurant AAA and [unintelligible] Valiant Captivia thoracic stent grafts also posted strong growth.","In emerging markets, we grew 14%, driven by both central and eastern Europe as well as the Middle East and Africa, which both grew about 20%.  Our emerging market results were in line with the expectations we communicated to you last quarter as we faced difficult comparisons from China due to the timing of the New Year holiday week.","In China, our integration of Kanghui is going well, with the business growing over 20% on a pro forma basis, offsetting our exit from the Weigao joint venture.  We are excited about the long term value segment opportunity that Kanghui represents in the global orthopedics market.","Now let\u2019s turn to our product pipeline, specifically our two largest midterm opportunities, the CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve and the Symplicity renal denervation system for treatment resistant hypertension.  Both of these products are market leaders in Europe, and we are planning to launch them in the U.S. in FY15.  ","In the U.S. CoreValve pivotal trial, the last patient follow up is already complete in our extreme risk arm, and we will be complete in our high-risk arm this fall.  Baseline patient demographic data will be presented at TVT this June.  Extreme risk data will be presented in a late-breaker at TCT this fall, and the high-risk data is expected to be presented at ACC next spring.  We have already submitted two of our [core modules] to the FDA, and are preparing for launch in the first half of FY15.  ","Turning to [unintelligible], we have made good progress in our U.S. clinical trial, and expect to complete the patient randomization soon.  At this point, we\u2019re expecting a late FY15 U.S. approval.  It is also important to note that our Symplicity system was recently accepted into the FDA and CMS panel review pilot program, which allows CMS to begin consideration for national coverage determination while the FDA completes its regulatory review, a process that we expect to meaningfully reduce the time between FDA approval and full reimbursement.","In addition to our focus on top line growth drivers, we are also executing on both our product and SG&A cost reduction initiatives, which, combined with financial leverage from our share buybacks, will help us achieve our goal of growing earnings per share of 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue.  After successfully reducing product cost by $1 billion from FY07 to FY12, we are now [unintelligible] into our new product cost reduction initiative that is focused on taking out an additional $1.2 billion in product cost through FY17.","This program is important not only to maintain our gross margins by offsetting pricing pressure, but also to fuel the development of [tiered] products, which are essential to creating new value segment opportunities.  ","Included in our results this quarter is a restructuring charge of which nearly half of the planned position reductions are related to manufacturing consolidation efforts.  We also continue to reduce headcount in slow-growing businesses and geographies.  These are never easy decisions, but are necessary in order to increase investment in our faster-growing opportunities.","We\u2019re also making progress in our plans to increase our U.S. cash flow through working capital improvements and have set a goal of increasing our inventory turns by 50% by FY17.  In FY13, the first year of our five-year inventory improvement program, we improved our inventory [unintelligible] by 7%.  Not only programs instill good fiscal discipline, but they ultimately strengthen our already robust levels of free cash flow genomes.  ","Over the next five years, we conservatively expect to generate over $25 billion of free cash flow and remain committed to returning 50% of this to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  We believe this level of commitment is appropriate given our current [unintelligible] of U.S. and international free cash flow.  The remaining 50% gives us the flexibility to make the necessary investments for sustainable growth.  ","We are, and will continue to be, very disciplined in how we deploy this capital, with a strong focus on returns.  We expect any M&A transaction to surpass our mid-teens risk-adjusted [unintelligible] rate and we do not expect these investments to be dilutive to shareholder EPS growth expectations.","As we look ahead to FY14, we remain focused on building credibility and a track record of delivering on our baseline expectations.  Gary will discuss our revenue outlook and EPS guidance in a moment, but I would like to discuss a few more of the more important drivers we see in FY14.","On the positive side, we should continue to see traction from our new products.  We should also see our momentum in emerging markets continue as we remove barriers to access, build [unintelligible] awareness, and expand our training programs.  In developed markets, we\u2019re expecting continued strength in Japan, especially in the beginning of the year.  In the U.S., we are planning for continued stabilization in key markets while in western Europe, we remain cautious as we go into FY14.","Resolution of a number of critical regulatory issues is a priority for us in FY14.  Specifically, the neuromodulation business is under an FDA warning letter, and we continue to work closely with the FDA to resolve the issues.  In addition, the FDA recently identified, in an audit of our diabetes business, some deficiencies related to our insulin pump quality systems.  And we\u2019ve already begun instituting changes and actions in resolving these issues.","I take these quality compliance issues very seriously, and we are working hard to make sure we\u2019re devoting whatever time and resources are necessary to resolve these issues quickly.  Ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has, and always will be, a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything we do at Medtronic.  ","We view FY14 as a pivotal year, as we not only make progress on delivering our transcatheter valve and renal denervation programs to the U.S. in FY15 but also begin to execute on transformational opportunities that we believe will establish durability in our long term performance and create potential upside to our baseline.","Our first long term transformational opportunity is accelerating globalization, particularly in emerging markets.  There is a significant opportunity to deepen the penetration of our existing therapies where pricing and margins are comparable to developed markets.  To realize this opportunity, we\u2019re investing in joint programs with a variety of stakeholders to overcome barriers in the areas of [unintelligible] diagnosis infrastructure and training.","Through these activities, we\u2019re also creating the necessary infrastructure and solutions to participate in the next wave of growth in the developing value segment.  We intend to be a global leader in this segment, and our recent investments in Kanghui and LifeTech are key initial steps toward this goal.","Not only do we believe that a tiered product portfolio will sustain our emerging market growth over the long term, we also believe that it will benefit our developed market businesses through reverse innovation as an increasing number of developed market customers seek value options over time.","Our other transformational opportunity is to systematically address the economic value needs of our customers and other stakeholders.  In the changing [unintelligible] environment, where payment models and customers are evolving, we believe that successfully addressing the growing importance of economic value considerations while still delivering clinical value will position us as the premier global medical technology solutions partner, creating value for healthcare systems around the world.","In general, our industry has been slow to adapt to this changing landscape, which I believe has led to increased pricing pressure and ultimately slow market growth.  Whereas in the past, physicians alone were the ones who were making purchasing decisions, increasingly other stakeholders are influencing or making those decisions.  Thus, medical technology innovation must evolve to meet the needs of a broader set of stakeholders, proven through both clinical as well as compelling economic evidence.  ","Ultimately, we must drive to not only improve patients\u2019 lives, but also ensure that the overall healthcare ecosystem remains viable.  This is an important shift in our focus, one that will enable us to be leaders in the new, emerging global healthcare landscape.","Let me also share with you why we believe we are uniquely positioned to increase our competitive advantage in this new environment.  We have a number of key strengths: our market leading products, our in-hospital footprint around the world, our healthcare economics expertise and [unintelligible] resources, and our strong financial position.  Together, this gives us unprecedented breadth, global reach and scale, and collectively these strengths will further differentiate Medtronic.   ","Finally, over the past year, we have been testing, piloting, and implementing a variety of programs to demonstrate economic value in new and interesting ways around the globe.  And in the coming quarters, you\u2019ll see an increase in the number of examples of [unintelligible] at work.  ","Ultimately, our goal is to be more than just a device provider, but rather the premier global technology solutions partner.  Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take any questions.  Gary?","Gary Ellis","Thanks, Omar.  Fourth quarter revenue of $4.459 billion increased 4% as reported and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for our $48 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.","Q4 revenue results by region were as follows.  Growth in central and eastern Europe was 24%.  The Middle East and Africa grew 21%.  Growth in Latin America was 18%.  Asia-Pacific grew 13%, including 19% growth in Japan.  Growth in greater China was 10%.  South Asia grew 6%.  And the growth in the U.S. was 3% while western Europe and Canada grew 1%.","The emerging markets were up a combined 14% in Q4, and represented 12% of our total sales mix.  Our Q4 emerging market and greater China growth was negatively affected by difficult comparisons due to the timing of the Chinese New Year.","Excluding this impact, we estimate that our emerging markets and greater China business grew in the mid to high teens.  Looking ahead, we would expect emerging markets to consistently grow in the high teens.  As we address the barriers and work with stakeholders our goal is to ultimately drive 20% growth in the emerging markets.","Q4 earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.124 billion and $1.10, an increase of 8% and 11% respectively.  Q4 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $969 million and $0.95, a decrease of 2% and an increase of 1% respectively as the prior year\u2019s GAAP numbers included the gain on the sale of our Physio-Control business unit.","This quarter\u2019s non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments included a $5 million gain associated with the acquisition-related items and a $182 million net restructuring charge that is largely driven by the planned reduction of approximately 2,000 physicians, which predominantly took place in CBG and spine.","From a geographic perspective, about half of these reductions were located outside the United States.  In addition, nearly half of the reductions are related to manufacturing and consolidated efforts as we continue to focus on reducing product costs.  This restructuring is expected to result in approximately $200 million to $225 million in annual savings.  ","In our cardiac and vascular group, revenue of $2.342 billion grew 5%.  Growth was broad-based, with all of our [CVV] businesses making contributions.  CRDM revenue of $1.332 billion grew 4%.  Worldwide ICD revenue of $755 million grew 2%, which was significantly better than the market, which we estimate declined 1%.","Our shock reduction and lead integrity alert technologies, combined with proven long term lead performance, continued to receive strong market acceptance.  In the U.S., our ICD revenue grew 2%, and we continue to see market stabilization.","We estimate we gained over 100 basis points of share over the past year.  Our lead [unintelligible] ratio continued to increase sequentially and is at the highest point in several years.  ","Our ICD implant volumes were sequentially stable for the fourth quarter in a row.  At the same time, our U.S. ICD pricing improved modestly on a sequential basis, declining 3% year over year.  This was the first quarter in several years where we have seen a sequential improvement in our pricing.","As we look ahead, we are launching our next generation of high powered devices in the U.S. this month.  Our Viva\/Brava CRT-D family, with our proprietary adaptive CRT algorithm, significantly reduces RV pacing and improves response rates to CRT therapy, resulting in improved device longevity and a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.","In addition, both the Viva\/Brava CRT-D and the Evera ICD contain the hand shock reduction algorithm, battery and circuit design improvements to extend device longevity, and an improved physio curve design, which meaningfully reduces device size and enhances patient comfort.  ","Patient revenue of $505 million grew 5%, outperforming the global market by over 500 basis points as we gain share on both a year over year basis and sequentially.  Our international pacing business grew 13%, driven by strong customer demand for the Advisa MRI pacemaker in Japan.  ","AF grew over 20%, driven by over 30% growth of our Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon system with EvenCool Cryo Technology as customers continue to adopt this second-generation system because it offers a more efficient, safe, and effective treatment for paroxysmal AF.  ","Coronary revenue of $465 million grew 5%.  Worldwide [DES] revenue in the quarter was $290 million, including $107 million in the U.S. and $29 million in Japan.  Resolute Integrity\u2019s deliverability, recent positive data regarding early dual antiplatelet therapy interruption, unique FDA labeling for diabetes, and long term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally, despite competitive product launches of next generation platform iterations.","While we have now anniversaried the initial launch of Resolute Integrity in the U.S., this quarter we received FDA approval for longer lengths of this product, and we continue to benefit from the launch in Japan.  ","In fact, Resolute Integrity continues to gain share in markets around the world.  We gained nearly 2 points of share sequentially in the U.S., 2 points of share sequentially in Japan, and 3 points of share in Europe.","In renal denervation, while Q4 revenue was modest, physician interest and acceptance of this therapy continues to grow, and the long term outlook for this opportunity in hypertension remains robust.  We are investing in developing referral networks, reimbursement, clinical and economic evidence, and technology development to further strengthen our leadership position.","This summer, we anticipate CE mark for our Symplicity Spiral multi-electrode catheter, which will reduce ablation times from the current 16 to 24 minutes down to only 2 minutes, and all through a very small six-branch catheter.  Results from our first in-human trial for spiral, as well as the first data set from our global Symplicity registry, will be presented at [unintelligible] later this week.  ","Also on the clinical front, we submitted our IDE to the FDA for Symplicity HTN-4, which is focused on expanding the indication to include uncontrolled hypertension patients with systolic pressure between 100 and 160 mm of mercury.  We believe our technology, strong clinical data, market development efforts, and pioneering IP position represent a large, multi-billion dollar opportunity in renal denervation.","In structural heart, revenue of $310 million increased 8%, including mid-teens growth in transcatheter valves.  We estimate the international transcatheter valve market grew approximately 10%.  Our CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut devices continue to have leading share in the international transfemoral market.","In Q4, we successfully launched our Engager valve in Europe, our first entry into the transapical segment, which represents approximately 20% of the European TAVI market.  One-year data from our CoreValve ADVANCE study was just presented at EuroPCR this morning.  ","In this rigorous, real-world study, CoreValve\u2019s survival rates are among the highest ever reported.  Stroke rate is low and stable, and CoreValve demonstrates exceptional, stable hemodynamic performance.  30-day results from our Engager European pivotal trial were also just presented at EuroPCR, demonstrating high procedural success and exceptional PVL performance.  ","Our U.S. CoreValve pivotal trial enrollment is complete, though we continue to enroll patients through both the continued access program and our expanded use registry.  We also continue to invest in next-generation technology.  We have submitted for CE mark for a valve in valve indication as well as for our [envail] delivery system.  We also expect to do the first in-human implant of our Evolut-R recapturable TAVI system in the summer.  ","In endovascular, revenue of $235 million grew 10%, with solid growth in both our aortic and peripheral businesses.  In aortic, we continue to see strong growth in Endurant in Japan, and we expect to launch Endurant in Japan in Q1.  In the U.S., we\u2019ve increased our share sequentially this quarter with Endurant II.  Our thoracic business grew over 25% on the strength of Valiant Captivia in the U.S. and international markets.","In peripheral, our market leading drug eluting balloon business posted strong double-digit growth.  We continue to make rapid progress in our U.S. drug eluting balloon pivotal trial for an SFA indication, and we expect a U.S. market launch of this important therapy in the first half of FY16.","Now turning to the restorative therapies group, revenue of $2.117 billion grew 4%.  Results was driven by growth in surgical technologies, neuromodulation, and diabetes.  Spine revenue of $811 million was flat, both globally and in the U.S.  Core spine revenue of $671 million was flat globally and grew 1% in the U.S..","Excluding [BCP], our core spine business grew 2% globally and grew 3% in the U.S., outperforming the U.S. markets as we gain share on both a sequential and year over year basis.  In fact, we estimate our U.S. core spine share increased 2 percentage points in FY13.  Our Solera posterior fixation system, Bryan artificial cervical disk, Atlantis Vision Elite cervical plate, and [ANP] interbody devices all drove incremental revenue in Q4.  ","U.S. market fundamentals remain relatively stable, with low single digit price mix declines and flat procedure volumes.  Surgical technologies revenue of $407 million grew 11%, driven by double-digit growth in neurosurgery and advanced energy.  Neurosurgery performance was driven by sales of large capital equipment, including O-arm imaging and StealthStation surgical navigation systems.","In addition, sales of Midas Rex powered surgical equipment and service revenue drove growth.  In advanced energy, strong double-digit growth of both Aquamantys bipolar sealers and PEAK PlasmaBlade electrosurgical products drove results.  We also added additional advanced energy sales reps to capitalize on the strong growth in this business. In ENT, our business continues to contribute solid and consistent mid single digit growth.  ","Turning to neuromodulation, revenue of $492 million increased 7%.  These results were driven by strong global growth in DBS and gastro uro.  In DBS, we had another strong quarter of double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets, as we continue to focus on building neurologist referral networks.  This targeted training and education is raising awareness of the therapy and resulting in double digit new implant growth, which is encouraging for the long term health of this business.  ","Gastro uro also [unintelligible] in Q4, driven by sales of InterStim therapy.  In western Europe, InterStim grew over 20% and in the U.S. we are seeing solid adoption of InterStim therapy for bowel control.","In [unintelligible] continues to drive growth and share gains in the U.S.  In western Europe, growth continues to be driven by the acceptance of our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation systems, the only system with CE mark approval for full body MRI scans.","Diabetes revenue of $407 million grew 4%.  In international markets, growth was 14%, as we continue to see strong adoption of the [unintelligible] pump with low glucose [unintelligible] and [unintelligible] CGM sensing.  In the U.S., revenue declined 2% as customers anticipate FDA approval of the U.S. version of this pump and sensor, branded the MiniMed 530G.","We have now deferred $23 million of revenue, including $14 million in Q4, as we plan to convert some of the recently sold pumps to the new technology when approved.  We look forward to the presentation of the results of the in-home portion of ASPIRE, our randomized trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Threshold Suspend automation feature and our sensor-augmented pumps.","Looking at our pipeline, we started the first user evaluations of our next generation pump platform, the MiniMed 640G, and expect to launch it in international markets in the first half of FY14.  We have also submitted our next-generation sensor, the Enlite II, for CE mark approval.  ","Turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q4 gross margin was 74.6%.  After adjusting for the $10 million non-GAAP adjustment from the restructuring charge, as well as the 30 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, the Q4 gross margin on a non-GAAP operational basis was 75.1%, which was below our expectations.  ","However, it is important to note that this was not due to pricing pressure, as our standard gross margin was flat year over year as we continue to successfully offset pricing pressure through our cost of goods sold reduction program.  Rather, the variance in our expectations was driven by other product costs, where our higher than expected financial results triggered a catch up in [unintelligible] expenses that negatively affected the gross margin by 30 basis points.  Excluding these items, our Q4 gross margin was 75.4%.  ","It is also worth noting that our gross margin includes additional spending related to the resources diverted to address quality issues in neuromodulation in diabetes, which negatively affected gross margin by approximately 20 basis points.  Looking ahead, we would expect the gross margin for fiscal year 2014 to be in the range of of 75% to 75.5% on an operational basis.","Third quarter R&D spending of $409 million was 9.2% of revenue.  We continue to invest in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth.  For FY13, R&D expense was 9.4% of revenue.  We would expect R&D expense in fiscal year 2014 to be somewhat less, around 9%, due to the tradeoffs we are making to partially offset the device tax as well as shifting R&D resources to resolve pending quality issues, which gets recognized in cost of goods sold.","Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.475 billion represented 33.1% of sales.  After adjusting for the 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, Q4 SG&A was 33%.  In FY13, we delivered 40 basis points of SG&A leverage, achieving a goal we set at the beginning of the year.","We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses.  In FY14, we expect to drive an additional 30 to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on an operational basis.  And it is worth mentioning that we typically see most of our level in the fourth quarter.","Amortization expense for the quarter was $84 million.  This came in slightly less than the outlook given on our Q3 call, due to the writeoff of certain intangibles.  For FY14, we would expect amortization expense to be approximately $85 million per quarter.","Net other expense for the quarter was $12 million of income, which was more favorable than our original forecast, primarily due to three factors.  First, the Puerto Rico excise tax was less than expected due to a lowering of the rate during the quarter.  Second, we received income from a litigation settlement with NuVasive, although it is important to note that the majority of our litigation against NuVasive is still unresolved.  ","And third, fluctuations in foreign currency resulted in greater gains from our hedging program.  As you know, we hedge our operating results to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange.  In Q4, net gains from our hedging program were $21 million.","Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY14 net other expense to be in the range of of $150 million to $190 million, which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. medical device tax.  For Q1 FY14, we expect net other expense to be in the range of of $55 million to $65 million, based on current exchange rates.  ","Net interest expense for the quarter was $48 million.  Excluding the $21 million noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $27 million.  At the end of Q4, we had approximately $11.1 billion in cash and cash investments, and $10.7 billion in debt after issuing $3 billion of senior notes in March and repaying $2.2 billion of convertible debt in April.  ","It is worth noting that we no longer have convertible debt outstanding, and going forward the non-GAAP adjustment will not be applicable, which results in a difficult comparison for the next four quarters.  Based on current rates, we would expect FY14 net interest expense to be in the range of of $150 million to $160 million, a level that is more comparable to our FY13 GAAP net interest expense.  ","It is also worth noting that at the end of Q4, we changed our time principle for classifying our investments on the balance sheet. Our preferred method is now based on the nature of our investment liquidity instead of the stated maturity date.  To conform the prior period balances to this new methodology, approximately $6.8 billion of investments have been reclassified from long term investments to current assets as of April 27, 2012.","In Q4, we generated over $1 billion in free cash flow, bringing our FY13 free cash flow to $4.4 billion.  We are committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.  In FY13, we have paid over $1 billion in dividends and repurchased over $1.2 billion of our common stock.  As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 27 million shares.  Fourth quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.023 billion shares.","For Q1, we would expect diluted weighted shares outstanding to decline by approximately 8 million shares and for the full fiscal year 2014 we would expect diluted weighted shares outstanding to be approximately 1.008 billion shares.","Now let\u2019s turn to our tax rate.  Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 16%.  Excluding the impact of one-time items, our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the fourth quarter was 16.9%.  Included in this rate is a $43 million net tax benefit associated with the finalization of certain foreign tax returns, reversal of a valuation allowance, and the tax impact of certain foreign dividend distributions.  ","Excluding the impact on one-time items, our FY13 adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 18.3%.  For FY14, we expect an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%.","Let me conclude by providing our initial fiscal year 2014 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance.  We were pleased by our improved performance in FY13, and growth in our end markets has been relatively stable.  Based on this, we believe that constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4%, which is consistent with the revenue outlook we had in fiscal 2013, remains reasonable for fiscal year 2014.  ","While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact, if the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the reminder of the fiscal year, then our FY14 would be negatively affected by approximately $240 million to $280 million, including a negative $45 million to $55 million impact in Q1.  ","Turning to guidance on the bottom line, based on the expected constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4%, we believe it is reasonable to model earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $3.85.  When evaluating this range on an operational basis, it is important to keep in mind the one-time tax benefits that we received in FY13 as well as the headwinds from the medical device tax and incremental interest expense in FY14.  Taking these adjustments into account, earnings per share of $3.80 to $3.85 would imply growth of 6% to 8% on an operational basis.  ","As in the past, my comments and guidance do not include any unusual charges or changes that might occur during the fiscal year.  I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?  ","Omar Ishrak ","Thanks, Gary.  Before I open the lines for Q&A, let me conclude by reiterating that our broad-based Q4 growth was a strong finish to a solid fiscal year, and represented another quarter [unintelligible] toward our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth.  ","We are still early in the process of strengthening and geographically diversifying our business in order to deliver this performance reliably.  There are still areas of uncertainty that are reflected in the guidance we are giving for FY14.  However, we intend to execute in areas we can control, including growing our market and building our business so that it is strong enough to offset the variables that are beyond our control.","And over time, we aim to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations, which are consistent with [unintelligible] revenue growth, consistent EPS growth of 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","At the same time, we are positioning Medtronic to play a leading role in transforming global healthcare by addressing the long term imperatives of economic value and globalization.  We are only at the beginning of establishing our track record, but we believe the [unintelligible] execution of both our baseline and long term growth strategies, combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long term, dependable value in healthcare.","With that, we would now like to open the phones for Q&A.  In addition to Gary, I\u2019ve asked Mike Coyle, president of our cardiac and vascular group, and Chris O\u2019Connell, president of our restorative therapies group, to join us again for the Q&A session.  ","We\u2019re rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so we respectfully request that you limit yourself to only one question, and if necessary, one follow up, so that we can get to as many people as possible.  If you have additional questions, please contact our investor relations team after the call.  Operator, first question please.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodd with Citigroup.","Matthew Dodd - Citigroup ","Emerging markets was up 14%.  Sounds like if you make a few minor adjustments maybe 15% to 17%.  But it\u2019s below your plan of 20%-plus, and when we look at fiscal \u201914, do you think 20%-plus is still reasonable for emerging markets?  Or is 15% to 20% more reasonable just based on what you think the markets are growing?","Omar Ishrak ","Twenty is certainly the number that we stated, but it\u2019s a number to work towards.  And that\u2019s certainly going to be our goal.  But I think 15% to 20%, if you were going to pick between the two, I would say 15% to 20% is probably a more realistic outlook.  But I\u2019m holding all the regions accountable to try to get to 20%.  There are barriers here that we have to overcome that are taking perhaps a little longer than we originally anticipated.  So that\u2019s what I would say on that.","Matthew Dodd - Citigroup ","And then Gary, quick one for you, I know you don\u2019t like giving quarterly guidance, but if you look at the first call progression, is the $0.90 for Q1 reasonable?  Or should we think about more of a ramp as we go through the year?","Gary Ellis","As you said, we don\u2019t like to give quarterly guidance.  But as we highlighted on our expectations, the $3.80 to $3.85 obviously includes some operational headwinds we\u2019re dealing with, the interest expense, the medical device tax, for example.  And if you take those into account, I think the $0.90 right now is indicating like a 6% to 7% growth in earnings per share, which would be basically not including that medical device tax and interest expense, [unintelligible] on the modeling.  ","Right now my guess is that if you looked at it, [DSI] probably would see a shift.  I think as you update your models, you\u2019ll probably be shifting a couple of cents from Q1 to Q4.  But in general, that guidance we gave should really kind of [unintelligible] across all of the quarters as we go forward.  So I think the number currently in Q1 is probably a little bit high as people take a look at their models.   ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","If I look at the U.S. business, it\u2019s your best quarter in three years, maybe even a little bit more than that.  One way we\u2019re looking at it, as we try to wade through the anniversary of the Resolute launch, is that if we looked at it ex-Resolute, it\u2019s also you\u2019re best quarter in a few years.  So the one question probably everybody has is repeatability.  And so if you could just talk about, in particular, the performance in the CRM business this quarter in the U.S. and whether you feel like that\u2019s a sustainable number, or if there was anything that really pushed it at the end of the quarter.","Omar Ishrak ","I think we\u2019ve certainly seen signs of end markets stabilizing to some degree.  But there are many dynamics here, including the ability to launch new products, and some Resolute share gain in this.  And I\u2019m going to ask Mike Coyle to really take this one, because [unintelligible] is obviously driving it.","Michael Coyle","We\u2019re obviously on the front end of a pretty robust new product introduction cycle here in the U.S., with the Advisa MRI in the early part of the quarter, but really starting to have impact on the back end of the quarter.  And we\u2019ll be just heading into our high power new product introductions with both the Viva\/Brava system here in the CRT-D segment and then the Evera device system as well.  ","So that\u2019s really the thing that\u2019s giving us the catalyst, not only in terms of market share, but also giving us some cover for the pricing pressure, not just because of these high-end technologies, but now we have multiple tiers to deal with, competitive pricing dynamics.  So those are  the primary drivers.  ","And as you saw, we\u2019re also continuing to take market share in the DES segment with Resolute Integrity and we\u2019re seeing channel strength across the businesses, across [EVG], so I think we\u2019re really getting some benefit, principally as we\u2019ve talked about before, from the shift over to CRDM, picking up the ball here from what Resolute Integrity has been providing us over the last fiscal year.  ","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","Let me try and cover a few items you covered on the call really quickly.  One, you said you expect CoreValve approval in the U.S. in the first half of FY15.  The question there is have you gotten signoff from the FDA to separate the two cohorts and submit the [extremers] cohort early.  And then second question is on the commentary around the FDA and the insulin pump quality systems, it sounds like that\u2019s going to impact the timing of 530G approval.  Can you just give us some insight there?  ","Omar Ishrak ","Let me quickly take on the diabetes question, then I\u2019ll ask Mike to provide the answer for the CoreValve.  In terms of diabetes, clearly until we get approval it\u2019s not going to get launched.  And so that does affect the timing to some degree.  We\u2019re planning for it within the calendar year.  I think that\u2019s the best I can tell you right now.  ","We\u2019re working closely with the FDA and doing everything we can to ensure that the quality systems are compliant, and per the requirements.  And in addition, we\u2019re working with them on any other needs that they may have for the approval itself.  So the best I can tell you is that we\u2019re still looking at it for the calendar year.  When exactly, it\u2019s impossible for me to estimate.","","Mike Coyle","And on the CoreValve IDE, nothing really has changed.  We\u2019ve completed the enrollment phase and the extreme risk side, and completed the follow up phase in the extreme risk side.  High risk, we will be finishing up in the coming quarters.  At this stage, we are viewing those as being submitted modularly, but planning for them to be reviewed together.  And if that changes based on what the data looks like, then we will communicate that.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","And Mike, just so I\u2019m clear on that, if the FDA waits for the high-risk arm in order to review it, then it\u2019s unlikely you would have approval in the first half of FY15?","Mike Coyle ","We see a path to getting there that way, but it would certainly be much more difficult.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","I just want to follow up on some of the things that have been asked about here, with the theme of the pipeline.  Can you give us a sense as to when we\u2019ll see the results of your U.S. trial for renal denervation in the United States?  Should I assume maybe ACC or PCR of 2014?","Mike Coyle ","For renal denervation, we\u2019re obviously in the process of completing the enrollment and randomization phase.  We would think we would be looking late in the fiscal year before we would see those data being recorded with complete follow up.  ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America ","So that would put you at about ACC or PCR, correct?","Mike Coyle ","At this stage, it\u2019s a little early to tell.  It would be late in the fiscal year.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America ","And then just a follow up on CRM and the drivers of your share gain, and what you assume in fiscal year \u201914, just to be specific, as you put together your fiscal year 2014 guidance, do you assume that you\u2019re going to be able to continue to take share at the pace that you\u2019re taking it currently?","Omar Ishrak ","Well, I think share gain is an important factor here, because our end markets are clearly not growing at the rate we\u2019re growing.  And so again, I\u2019ll let Mike give some color to that, but that\u2019s certainly in our consideration.","Mike Coyle ","There are multiple factors that I think are going to help us drive market share capture.  Obviously the Advisa MRI in Japan we\u2019re going to continue to get benefit of that until the anniversary.  The Advisa MRI launch here in the U.S. [unintelligible] really in the second half of Q4, so we will have the benefits of both the price premium we have gotten there, as well as the ability to take share and initials and to use the broader product range we have to deal with pricing pressure, which we think will help us in our share position overall.","In Europe, the Viva\/Brava launch has really been very well received.  It\u2019s not just the fact that our Adapta CRT technology is really the first feature that has actually been able to show increase in CRT response, but it\u2019s also addressing reductions in heart failure hospitalization which is a hot button, both in Europe and in the U.S.  ","In addition, the Attain Performa lead obviously gives us our first quadripolar lead in the marketplace and we think is offering, from physician feedback we\u2019ve received, significant advantage over competitive product in terms of the narrow dipole giving us an opportunity to have lower phrenic nerve stimulation as well as the use of the [unintelligible] Express algorithm, which automatically adjust for what the physician adjust for, the LV capture thresholds in the lead impedance.  ","So these are giving us ASP increases as well as the opportunity to take share in Europe, and we will have the Viva\/Brava system without the Attain Peforma lead in the U.S. for most of the year.  And then obviously we have not even begun the launch of the Evera product line, which gives us size and longevity advantages which we think will help us in the standard CRT segment. Not to mention that we\u2019ve also been growing north of 20% in the AF segment, because of the cryo advance technology, our Arctic Front Advance technology.","So we think we have a number of ways to continue to take share in that segment, and we think that will be an important part of getting to the guidance we\u2019ve given.","Gary Ellis ","Just quickly, if you think about it, our end markets are kind of growing in a 2-3% range overall.  Our guidance of 3-4% says that we will continue to outperform the market in FY14.  That doesn\u2019t assume at the level we did in FY13.  If we performed at the levels we did in FY13, we\u2019d probably even exceed our guidance.  So there is some assumption in our guidance that we gave for the revenue that assumes that we basically continue to gain share and outperform the market, across all businesses, not just CRDM.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley ","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Omar, obviously a lot of focus on the call today on the pipeline, and FY15 is looking like one of the most interesting pipeline years for the company in terms of catalyst.  But a lot of that traction with the pipeline may occur late FY15 into FY16.  I just wonder, if you think about the timing of that pipeline, over the next 18 months, do you feel comfortable with your organic growth?  Or is this a period where Medtronic looks to maybe supplement this sort of gap period, 12-18 months, externally, or with M&A?","Omar Ishrak ","M&A is always a possibility.  But in our guidance, our planning right now, we haven\u2019t [received] anything concrete, although things can happen.  Really our formula here is to attempt to repeat what we had over the last 12 months.  And therefore, we\u2019ve kind of kept the guidance where it was earlier this year.  And agree that some of the products have anniversaried, but we\u2019ve seen enough new product activity that we feel there\u2019s enough reason for us to expect to repeat the year, or at least meeting the guidance that we just stated.","You know, there are many issues here that we\u2019ve got to overcome.  The markets are still uncertain.  Europe, as you\u2019ve seen, was down last quarter, up this quarter, and it\u2019s somewhat volatile.  We\u2019ve got these approvals of some of these products, where the timing is uncertain.  So there are pressures.  We\u2019re just assuming that the amount of new product activity that we\u2019ve seen across the board, and there\u2019s a lot of that, is enough to offset those.  ","So that\u2019s really all I can say, and we\u2019ve got to work through the next 18 months and [unintelligible].  This is a balanced look and we\u2019ve got to work towards achieving it.  But it\u2019s a level of execution that I want this team to be able to deliver on.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","And then Gary, maybe just a quantification.  You talked a lot about what\u2019s embedded in broader guidance, specifically CRM.  If you look to spine, obviously another encouraging quarter.  Can you just talk about what you think you saw across the balance of the year in terms of spine market share?  What\u2019s the expectation for fiscal \u201914?  And is there any embedded expectation of acceleration if the June results with BMP are positive?","Gary Ellis ","The answer is no, we\u2019re not expecting, from the June results necessarily, any uplift from, for example, [unintelligible], any growth there.  But as we did highlight in the call, [unintelligible]\u2019s testing has stabilized a little bit, which is obviously minimizing the drag that we had on the overall spinal business, starting to become a little bit less as we go forward, as we\u2019ve anniversaried that product, falling off.  But the reality is, the other core spine business, with all the new products we\u2019ve been launching, continues to gain share, and as I indicated in the call, we\u2019ve picked up a couple of points of share here in FY13 on the core spinal business, with AMT, with Solera, some of these new products, and we expect that to continue as we go forward, that we will continue to gain share.  I\u2019ll let Chris expand on that.","Chris O\u2019Connell ","That\u2019s right, Gary.  I think the spine story is very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about in the past, that our relative performance in the market is steadily increasing, and we\u2019re clearly in share capture mode at this point in time.  We have the bulk of our Solera systems in the market and that\u2019s really driving our overall growth.  ","But as Gary pointed out, we\u2019ve added new technologies into the mix, like the Bryan cervical disk in the U.S., where we\u2019ve now doubled our modest market share from 5% to 10% in that category just six months after launch, where we have new AMT and body devices into the market.  But also, what\u2019s really driving our spine business is the use of enabling technologies like imaging and navigation.  Our O-arm imaging business is up in the 30% range this year, and where we have O-arms placed in key accounts, we\u2019re seeing up to 10 points higher growth in our core spine business.  ","So we\u2019re getting more and more traction in terms of combining some of our unique surgical capabilities on imaging navigation, power monitoring, etc. to drive our overall spine implant business, which is really helping customers achieve their goals.  ","Operator","Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell, Credit Suisse.  ","Matt - Credit Suisse","Hey, this is Matt in for Bruce.  You mentioned cost uncertainties in Europe, and I wondered if you could talk about, relative to the weakness that you highlighted in January in Europe, has Europe kind of stayed the same?  Or do you think it\u2019s gotten a little better?  And what factors are different now versus what you saw then?","Omar Ishrak ","You know, what we talked about in January potentially was a reflection of the new year cycle.  There was a difference in the holiday period which really put pressure on sales for that quarter.  Since then, the market has stabilized back to the normal levels that we\u2019ve seen prior to January, early in Q3, which we talked about at that time.  ","And so to that degree, the market has returned to some degree of stabilization, but I can tell you that in Europe you\u2019ve got a variety of countries, they\u2019re all dealing with different types of economic pressures, and healthcare is certainly central in their mind as a cost item.  And so while we\u2019re working with governments to make sure that we provide the right value with what we have, at the same time, there could be austerity measures in a variety of countries.  There could be a [re-look] of some of the regulations like they\u2019re doing in the U.K. where the NHS has recently, in the last couple of weeks, completely retooled in the way they\u2019re organizing things.  ","So there\u2019s a variety of activity going on in Europe, and that\u2019s why we say that it\u2019s somewhat uncertain, because there are a number of governments out there driving policy, all the way from austerity to [unintelligible] healthcare policy.  That\u2019s the best I can give you.  But in general, I\u2019d say that our weekly run rates, for example, are comparable to what we had in November, December of last year.","Gary Ellis ","Obviously in our third quarter earnings call, we were very nervous about what happened in January, and were much more cautious.  And as we saw in the results, western Europe and Canada grew 1% this quarter.  Last quarter, I think it was down 1%, 1.5%.  So the fact of the matter is, yes, we saw an improvement in the January, significant shortfall, clearly has improved over this quarter.  ","But as Omar said, that being said, the marketplace is still very volatile, just 1% or 2% growth in the market.  And that\u2019s with us outperforming the market.  The reality is probably the market in Europe is flat to even slightly down, and the fact that we\u2019re kind of growing 1% to 2% is outperforming the market.  So in general some of our fears on the third quarter earnings call maybe were a little bit overstated, but the fact is Europe is still very volatile.","Matt - Credit Suisse ","And then you mentioned an easement in U.S. ICD pricing pressure in the quarter.  And I wanted to see if you had a sense, are you getting a mix benefit there?  Or do you think the like for like environment is actually getting a little better?","Gary Ellis ","I think we\u2019re getting a bit of a mix benefit, but we\u2019re also doing more of our provisions and discounting on multi-line deals across our cardiac and vascular group.  And this gives us an opportunity to spread the discounting that the customers expect, or are asking for, from targeted reductions from competitors across a much larger revenue base, which has given us an opportunity to push off some of that discounting.  So those items, I think, in addition to probably most importantly the new product, are what give us the opportunity to manage this pricing a little more effectively than we were doing six months ago.","Omar Ishrak ","You know, one comment that I\u2019d like to make, probably in response to a number of questions earlier, is that in our outlook for FY14, we talked a lot about new products and their success.  But I also want to point out that let\u2019s not underestimate the impact of our CBG sales force are approaching the cardiac [line] administrator.  Now we\u2019ve had like two years of doing this.  We\u2019re learning how to optimize our presence [unintelligible] the [line] industry to make [unintelligible] more effectively, and I think that\u2019s probably a factor as well, in our success.","Mike Coyle ","There\u2019s no doubt that the nature of the decision making process for therapy choice and brand selection has changed, and it is now much more of a group decision making process among the interventional physicians and the cardiovascular line administrators.  And by organizing the way we have, we are just more efficient at being able to identify their needs and then deliver them across a multiline offering.  And so that is becoming a bigger and bigger part of how we approach the customer and the customers are responding to it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets  ","One is, can you set expectations for the [unintelligible] results?  What would you consider to be a best case, and what would you consider to be a worrisome outcome?","Omar Ishrak ","I don\u2019t want to conjecture on that.  The results are due in June.  Let\u2019s see what comes out, and then we\u2019ll kind of go from there.  But it\u2019s inappropriate for me to speculate on either what they\u2019ll be or what we think would be good or bad.","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets ","The second follow up is you\u2019ve talked about a more healthy economic approach to selling over time into the hospital purchasing process.  You mentioned that a little bit in how it\u2019s helping your pricing in your [unintelligible] business, but is there another way that we can think about measuring that over time?","Omar Ishrak ","Well, you know, we\u2019re going to work on that to try to highlight some of the key factors there.  In the end, we want to deliver overall growth and performance, and the exact reason for that, either it\u2019s not that important to be too specific about that, but we do know that hospitals and physicians are sensitive to the economics of their purchase, and we try to line ourselves up in a way that we can demonstrate the value of what we have in that language.  ","Now, having said that, the other thing to look at are perhaps deals that we make where we have combined imaging, navigation, as well as [unintelligible].  That clearly is a deal that we can make, only because we have that selection of products and the users see some value in that collection.  So going forward, looking at the number of accounts where we have all of that, and how our spine [unintelligible] is doing, may be a measure.  And then as you further refine the CBG look, we might even do more sophisticated programs that you can highlight.  ","Mike Coyle ","Just one other thing to keep in mind, in addition to simply being broader offerings and targeted call points for line administrators as well as the interventional physicians, we\u2019re also offering a large number of value-added programs, [unintelligible] outpatient clinics and patients flow through the cath labs.  Use of technology like Care Link Express to have ERs be able to identify a patient with a device immediately when they come in the door, without having to wait for a represent.  [We think blood] conservation is a program that minimizes the use of blood products.  ","We\u2019re also helping with market development, with things like Heart Mark, which basically allow them to look in an [attachment] area and see what the level of therapy is that\u2019s being provided to various untreated needs and see if they are at national averages above or below.  So these are all things that actually get translated from the viewpoint of the cardiovascular line administrator into value that we can claim credit for in lieu of pricing.  So it\u2019s share, it\u2019s pricing, it\u2019s basically our ability to partner and be viewed as a strategic partner in addressing the healthcare needs that these administrators are struggling with.  ","Omar Ishrak ","One other comment I\u2019d make is that as we formulate the strategy as we go forward, we\u2019ll help you understand some of the specific drivers, but we\u2019re still in the process ourselves of organizing this, figuring out how to communicate this and organize the structure.  So it\u2019s still early in the process, but developing a framework for economic value.  And when we\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll share it with you.","Gary Ellis ","And the only thing I would add to what everyone\u2019s said is basically in the end, this economic value and our ability to work with the line administrators is a way for us to differentiate ourselves from the competition.  And I think you\u2019ve seen that in the share gains and results we\u2019ve had so far, and we expect that to continue.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein","I wanted to follow up with you on some of the comments you made around further combining the CBG group down to the district manager level.  Does that combination initiative, economic value center you talk about, does that result in any sort of selling line synergies?  And\/or, more broadly speaking, when we think about the 30-50 basis points of SG&A leverage that we\u2019ll be seeing next year, how much of that, if any, comes from selling line synergies and where might you be with some of the selling line pilot programs that might lead to some cost savings there?","Omar Ishrak ","Let me just give you a little perspective and then I\u2019ll let Mike also add to that.  First, the primary goal of this is to align with the customers.  That\u2019s the primary goal.  Second, to the degree that our people are required to deliver care, to deliver therapy, which a large number of our clinical representatives do, that will never go away.  So our relationship with physicians at that level will always stay.  We view that with great importance, and that will never go away.  This move is primarily around aligning with the way our customers themselves are looking at their own business.  Now having said that, in any organization there will be some efficiencies.  And I\u2019ll let Mike comment on that.  ","Mike Coyle ","I would just echo Omar\u2019s comments.  First of all, first line sales representatives are physician focused, as they have always been, and are aligned with our original businesses, because that\u2019s where you have to win first, is with the physicians.  ","But this move toward consolidation at the next level up for sales management is really to make us much more nimble and efficient in dealing with the hospital, and viewing it more holistically as the cardiovascular line, because frankly where we\u2019re seeing our [hospital] customers winning is where they are aligning their various cardiovascular lines under a single administrative leader.  And so this makes us more efficient both at the physician level and at the first line sales management level.  ","But there are efficiencies, and I would just remind you, from our discussion of the Resolute Integrity launch, we basically went from a 10% market share to a 30% market share, with no extension of our sales force in terms of adding new people.  And the way we did that was marry up the existing coronary focused sales reps with mostly CRDM clinical specialists who had excellent cardiology relationships to be able to basically move much more quickly in terms of putting those products into the market.  ","And the other thing that it allows us to do, for example, with [IDNs] is because Medtronic approaches those IDNs as a single CBG supplier, we were able to hold off what competitors were trying to do in terms of basically pushing out contracts when we brought Resolute Integrity into the marketplace so that we would be blocked from coming in.  When we approached those IDNs and basically talked about the broader CBG system, they were basically not willing to extend contracts for competitors, and that really helped us ramp Resolute Integrity very quickly.  So there are synergies that we\u2019re realizing from the strategy of beyond simply the first line sales management consolidation.  ","Gary Ellis ","There\u2019s no question that what\u2019s going on on CBG, what we\u2019re also doing across the restorative therapies group, in our regions, that is where we\u2019re getting some of the leverage that we\u2019re talking about in the SG&A.  It\u2019s making our own sales organization much more effective and more efficient.  We\u2019re obviously getting the benefits that both Mike and Omar talked about, but there\u2019s no question a part of the 30 to 50 basis points of improvement in SG&A are coming from some of these as a result of it being more efficient and leveraging these resources.","Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein ","We have been hearing some anecdotal evidence that Biotronik is getting a little bit more aggressive on the pricing front there in the market, and our survey shows that they may be picking up a little bit of share.  Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you would respond to that threat of a low price strategy from a competitor in the near term.  I understand that you\u2019re talking about this tiered pricing strategy, so you clearly have a long term strategy that you\u2019re putting in place to address that.  In the near term, how do you respond to that low price threat from a competitor?","Omar Ishrak ","I think in all of this, our ability to provide evidence for value is pretty critical.  And the more we tie it to clinical [unintelligible], economics, the better off we\u2019ll be.  And that\u2019s a thread across all of our businesses, and that will help us deal with any low-cost competitor, in that we\u2019ve differentiated ourselves by demonstrating the value that we have.  ","Mike Coyle","Specific to that statement, Biotronik is not the only one who\u2019s been using aggressive pricing tactics to try to take market share.  In fact, some players who\u2019ve not historically done that have become more aggressive in that particular area.  But if you look at, for example, our product tiering now available to us on the pacing side, we have six tiers of technology that we can be able to bring to deal with giving pricing where it has to be given, but protecting our higher-end technologies from that kind of pricing pressure.  ","So I think we\u2019re in a good position to use the [blood] CBG strategy, the services that we talked about, and frankly, the fact that we are the ones who bring that next generation of technologies, the key therapies, things like renal denervation, like transcatheter valves, drug eluting balloons, like the cryoablation technologies, that also give us an opportunity to establish a relationship on the basis of what we bring totally in our program.  And those things together are giving us an opportunity to basically protect pricing and take market share.   ","Omar Ishrak ","Thanks for all your questions, and before I end today\u2019s call, as you think about your summer calendars, I\u2019d like to note that an every other year cadence for our analyst meeting is more appropriate, and we do not plan to host an analyst meeting this year.  I would also note that we anticipate holding our Q1 call on August 20.  With that, and on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic.  Thank you.

My name is Jackie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic first quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead. ","Ryan Weispfenning","Great. Thank you, Jackie. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our FY '17 first quarter which ended on July 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks we will be happy to take your questions. First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. ","You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website investorrelations.Medtronics.com. ","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of FY '16 and all year-over-year growth ranges are given on a constant currency and constant weeks basis which adjust for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in our prior-year first quarter. As previously disclosed, we estimate the extra week had an approximate $450 million impact on revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 impact to earnings per share. The extra week impact for each business or region was estimated by adjusting Q1 FY '16 revenue by the prorated total Company impact. ","The constant currency adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. With that I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. ","Omar Ishrak","Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported first quarter revenue of $7.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.03 representing another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. All our business groups and regions delivered strong growth, resulting in Company-wide revenue growth over 5%. In addition, our continued focus on both operating and financial leverage drove solid double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow generation as we continue to strategically deploy our capital against our priorities of reinvesting with discipline in M&A and R&D, returning substantial cash to our shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. We feel very good about our momentum to start our fiscal year and are confident in our ability to the sustain this performance over the coming quarters. Now let's turn to the drivers of our revenue growth.","We have three specific growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies. New therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions with quantified growth expectations for each. In New Therapies we delivered results at the upper end of our goal in Q1 contributing over 300 basis points to our total Company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group which grew in the mid single-digits, we continue to complement our steady cadence of differentiated products with market-leading breadth, scale and technology innovation. In CRHF, our AF Solutions and Diagnostic Businesses again delivered impressive growth. AF Solutions grew in the mid-30%s, well above market growth on the strength of Arctic Front Advance cryoballoon and our recent FIRE AND ICE clinical data.","In Diagnostics which grew in the low double-digits, market acceptance of our Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder had strong momentum resulting in increased pacemaker pull-through. In our core CRHF and peripherals business revenues were flat in the global market that, in our estimation, was down in the low single-digits. In the U.S. low single-digit growth in initial implants as well as our shared gains in high-power implants offset mid-single-digit declines in device replacements. We continue to take share in the U.S. with MRI safe systems and our recently launched Visia AF ICD. In Q1 we started shipments for MICRA Transcatheter Pacing System, the world's smallest pacemaker at 1\/10 the size of the traditional device. Concurrently, we initiated physician training in the U.S. and we look forward to obtaining a national coverage decision from CMS for this transformative therapy by the end of the fiscal year.","We also look forward to a number of new product launch catalysts over the balance of the fiscal year, including Claria MRI CRT-D system with effective CRT pacing in the U.S. and Japan, Visia AF in Japan, Reveal LINQ in Japan and our CRT-P quadripolar pacing system in Europe. We closed our acquisition of HeartWare earlier this week, a leading innovator of miniaturized circulatory support technologies for the treatment of advanced heart failure. We're pleased to now significantly broaden our range of therapeutic options for heart failure patients with the addition of HeartWare and we expect it to add meaningful revenue growth to CVG throughout the balance of the fiscal year and beyond. Not only do we have complementary technologies and service capabilities, including infection control, physiological sensors and algorithms, remote patient monitoring and patient management and integrated diagnostics, but we also have experience with rechargeable battery technology and implantable controllers that can accelerate the development of reliable, fully implantable, LVAD systems.","In CSH, our Resolute Onyx XDES and Euphoria balloons are driving solid mid single-digits international growth in our coronary business but we experienced declines in the U.S. from competitive product launches. We anticipate FDA approval and market release of Resolute Onyx in the U.S. around the end of FY '17. In structural heart, the global TAVR market is robust, growing 40%. We continued to gain share in international markets with our CoreValve and CoreValve Evolut R valves. However, the lack of a large-size Evolut R is limiting our share in the U.S. market. We expect approval of our Evolut R XL valve early in the calendar year 2017. Earlier this month, Evolut R was the first system to be granted CE Mark for intermediate risk patients and we're on track to submit our SURTAVI data for U.S. intermediate risk indication expansion approval in Q4 this fiscal year.","In APV we had strong high single-digit growth in our aortic business with Endurant IIs aortic stent graft, Heli-FX EndoAnchor system and Valiant Captivia thoracic stent graft technologies all fueling growth. In our peripheral business growth was driven by our IN.PACT Admiral DCB which continues to outpace and lead the fast-growing drug coated balloon market on the strength of its handling characteristics and differentiated clinical data. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew in the mid single-digits with consistent quarterly performance stemming from five key growth drivers, open to minimally invasive surgery or MIS, gastrointestinal diseases, lung cancer, end stage renal disease and respiratory compromise.","Open to MIS grew in the high single-digits in Q1 driven by the recent product introductions in our advanced energy portfolio like the Valleylab FT10 energy platform as well as the continued adoption of Endo GIA Reloads with Tri-Staple Technology portfolio, specifically the Endo GIA reinforced reloads. G.I. diseases and lung cancer also grew the high single-digits with solid growth in our G.I. Solutions business resulting from the continued launch of the Barrx 360 Express RF Ablation balloon catheter. Our focus on end-stage renal disease is benefiting from the fiscal Q4 acquisition of Bellco, a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the low double-digits. We were pleased to return both the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and the Capnostream 20 patient monitor to customers and patient following ship holds that were put in place last fiscal year.","We continue to supplement MITG with tuck-in acquisitions. Earlier this month we closed on the acquisition of Smith & Nephews fast-growing gynecology business that will complement our existing global GYN product line. We also closed on our agreement to acquire majority ownership position in the Netherlands Obesity Clinic or NOK which I will cover in more detail later. Across MITG, we're developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster, complication-free recovery and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions. In our Restorative Therapies Group, we're reinvigorating therapy innovation across all of our disease-focused businesses, delivering a consistent cadence of solutions across the patient care continuum resulting in mid single-digit growth this quarter.","In Spine, we grew in line with the market with mid single-digit growth in the U.S. offsetting an international decline. Outside the U.S., we were mainly affected by the macroeconomic challenges in the Middle East, where we have strong market share and where the continued BMP in Europe which we believe should be resolved by the end of the fiscal year. In the U.S., we continue on an upward trajectory, delivering another quarter of sequential improvement in our growth rate. Our speed to scale strategy is producing tangible results as we launch a steady cadence of procedural innovation like our OLIF procedure and new products including the SOLERA VOYAGER, ELEVATE and PTC interbodies for key lift and mid-lift procedures. ","Last month we obtained two-level FDA approval for our Prestige LP which we expect will help drive adoption of cervical disk arthroplasty procedures in the U.S. In addition, to speak to scale our focus on surgical synergy which combines enabling technology with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedural solutions is starting to show results. In fact, the combined growth of our spine business and our spine imaging and navigation capital equipment in our Neurosurgery Business was in the high single-digits in U.S. in Q1. We believe this is an indication of our overall growth in spine procedures and a more relevant comparison of our spine results against several of our competitors. We're also excited about our partnership with Mazor Robotics which is generating significant surge in interest and together we're set to introduce the Mazor X at NASS later this year. All our businesses in our Brain Therapies division delivered a strong quarter. In Neurovascular, our Solitaire FR mechanical connectivity device is delivering strong results even after the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine articles last year, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market. In Brain Modulation, our DBS products had a solid quarter and we just received CE Mark for SureTune2 which provides patient-specific visualization to aid in DBS programming.","In Neurosurgery we saw a robust sales of the recently launched O-arm 02 surgical imaging system as well as the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system. While our Pain Therapies division declined in the low single-digits due to continued competitive pressure in our spinal cord stimulation products, our drug pumps grew in the mid single-digits. Our Interventional business showed continued strength growing in the low single-digits with our OsteoCool RF spinal tumor ablation system driving solid growth and generating pull-through of our balloon catheter plasty products. And all of our business in our Specialty Therapies division, ENT, Pelvic Health and Advanced Energy, collectively grew in the low double-digits. Turning now to our Diabetes group.","We delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter with solid growth in our Intensive Insulin Management division driven by strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G system outside the U.S. While the U.S. market remains competitive, we were pleased to receive FDA approval for our MiniMed 630G earlier this month and we expect to see strong U.S. growth of this platform just like we have seen with the 640G outside the U.S. The 630G features a new, contemporary pump hardware platform including a waterproof case, HD full-color screen and remote bolus capability directly from the meter, along with several enhancements to our Enlite Sensor. The new platform also integrates continuous glucose monitoring with SmartGuard technology which is the only technology available in the U.S. that not only takes specific action against lows but also reduces the frequency of nighttime low episodes by a third.","In addition to our current offerings we submitted the PMA for our hybrid closed loop system with the Enlite 3 CGM sensor to the FDA in June of this year. In our non-intensive diabetes therapy division we saw another quarter of very strong growth as we continue to promote our iPro2 professional CGM system to type II patients being cared for by primary care physicians through our partnership with Henry Schein. Our NDT pipeline is centered on a steady cadence of product applications and informatics innovation to enable primary care physicians and patients to make better, more informed choices in the management of type II diabetes. In our Diabetes Services and Solutions division, we saw solid growth from both our consumables business and from Diabeter which I will cover in a moment.","We're excited about the recent CE Mark approval for our Guardian Connect standalone CGM system with our current enhanced Enlite sensor and expect initial product availability in fiscal Q3. In the U.S., we have submitted our PMA application to the FDA earlier this year and expect to launch Guardian Connect together with the next generation sensor in the second half of this fiscal year. Guardian Connect allows us to provide both type I and type II patients in multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. We also continue to make strong progress with our partnership with IBM and remain on track to launch our Sugar.IQ personal diabetes assistant powered by Watson in the next few months. When you combine our diabetes devices with our applications in cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring to our partnership with IBM, we expect to provide both type I and type II patients with not just a sensor but a comprehensive diabetes management solution.","Across all four of our groups, CVG, MITG, RTG and Diabetes, our new product pipeline is robust and we're confident we can drive sustainable growth of our new therapies growth vector within our 200 to 350 basis point goal. Next let's turn to emerging markets which delivered double-digit growth contributing over 150 basis points to our total Company growth in line with our expectations. We continue to execute against our strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. We feel that these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. In Q1, our businesses in South Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and China all grew in the mid-teens or higher. In China, our latest -- our largest emerging market, we continued to outperform the overall market with our unit growth rates from all four of our business groups growing in the mid-teens. Latin America also had strong broad-based growth across our major markets, Brazil, Columbia, Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Brazil was particularly strong from both recent distributor conversions and solid product growth in MITG. In South Asia, of which India is the largest market, we achieved low 20%s growth with all of our groups delivering double-digit growth.","We won important tenders in several product categories and are engaged in multiple private -- public partnership opportunities across India. The only region with pressure in emerging markets in Q1 was the Middle East and Africa where we had declines in Saudi Arabia as a result of the macroeconomic environment in that country that is causing government budget controls, product license delays and tender delays. Overall however, the consistency of our emerging market performance benefits strongly from increased geographic diversification reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in med tech over the long term.","Turning now to our services and solutions growth vector which contributed approximately 30 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, services and solutions continues to achieve strong revenue growth mostly from CVG related offerings. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model's expanded across all our business groups. We continue to see success in our hospital solutions business through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms. In Q1 our service revenue growth from hospital solutions was in the mid-40%s. We have now completed a total of 97 long term managed service agreements with hospital systems representing more than $2.1 billion in contracted service and product revenue over an average span of six years.","While the majority of our activity is in Europe, we continue to expand into other regions including Latin America and the Middle East and Africa. Our Care Management Services business which is primarily focused on remote monitoring of high cost and chronic disease patients with comorbidities grew in the high single-digits in Q1. Driven by strong interest and growth from payers as well as providers moving towards value-based care models. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundle payment models for different interventions. We're now also managing chronic conditions in diabetes and obesity through our acquisition of Diabeter and majority stake in NOK. Diabeter, our holistic diabetes care management organization that is currently operating for centers in the Netherlands, delivered revenue growth over 50% in Q1 and we're now treating over 1700 patients.","We're currently developing plans to expand the Diabeter model into other countries. NOK is a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery offering integrated comprehensive care model including extensive screening, pre-care program, bariatric surgery, post surgery program and long term follow-up. We plan to gain critical insights from NOK's methodology and expand into more countries providing broader patient access to their multidisciplinary teams of specialists thereby improving patient outcomes. We expect all of these new businesses will start to contribute significantly to the services and solutions growth vector moving it to our expected range over the next few quarters.","Turning now to our Q1 P&L, we grew revenue more than 5% in non-GAAP diluted EPS approximately 14% to 16% which resulted in EPS leverage of approximately 1,000 basis point. Our strong revenue growth and high profitability is generating significant accessible free cash flow and we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. ","Before turning the call over to Karen, I'd like to note that we continue to refine our thinking on value-based healthcare solutions. As you know, CMS in the U.S. is shifting payments for certain episodes of care for fee-for-service to bundle payments over longer time horizon. Our recently formed orthopedic solutions business continues to refine, together with our surgeon partners, our compelling comprehensive solution for CMS's first episodic bundle in joint replacement. Last month CMS announced their plans to expand bundle payments beyond hips and knees to AMI and CABG procedures where we have significant market presence and clinical expertise. We're analyzing the details of these proposed bundles and intend to submit our comments CMS as we move toward expected finalization of these payment models.","While we're still early in the journey to value-based healthcare, we remain focused and fully understanding and leading the shift to healthcare systems that reward value and patient outcomes over volume. And we continue to develop partnerships and insights into how we can utilize our expertise to play a role in this evolution. We feel appropriate application of medical technology can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in healthcare delivery driving new forms of value creation for both our customers and our shareholders. With that I will now turn the call over to our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who I am pleased to welcome to Medtronic and she will take there a more detailed look at our first quarter financial results. Karen? ","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar. Our first quarter revenue $7.166 billion decreased 1% as reported or increased over 5% on a constant currency, constant week basis. Foreign currency had a negative $7 million impact on first quarter revenue and acquisitions and divestitures contributed approximately a net 70 basis points to revenue growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. Non-GAAP was $1.03. After adjusting for the $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and the $0.08 to $0.10 estimated impact from the extra week last fiscal year, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew approximately 14% to 16%. EPS came in slightly above our expectations due to a $0.01 to $0.02 tax benefit. In addition to the $376 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were a $79 million net restructuring charge and a $39 million charge for acquisition-related items, both stemming mostly from our continued integration of Covidien.","A $52 million litigation charge and a $31 million net benefit related to the resolution of several tax matters with the IRS, including a benefit from our Tyco tax issue and a charge for a proposed agreement resolving matters stemming from several acquisitions. The net tax benefit does not include any impact related to our Puerto Rico royalty rate dispute with the IRS which has not yet been resolved [Technical Difficulty] for the quarter was 27.4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the extra week, the operating margin showed an approximate 100 basis point improvement over the prior year. Our operating margin included a gross margin of 68.9%, SG&A of 34% and R&D of 7.8%, all on a constant currency basis. While our gross margin was down slightly, mainly due to revenue mix, we drove improvement in SG&A, largely a result of execution on our Covidien synergies.","We're pleased with the smooth completion of our SAP implementation in Europe in the first quarter and will continue with implementations across other regions over the next several quarters. Separately and collectively these conversions help drive future synergies. We remain on track to deliver $225 million to $250 million of synergy savings this fiscal year and expected to deliver on our commitment of $850 million of savings by the end of FY '18. Our efforts to realize the Covidien synergies are also serving as enablers to catalyze other leverage programs designed to deliver additional long term margin expansion. Looking ahead at our operating margin keep in mind that recent acquisitions, including hardware, while not expected to be dilutive to EPS on a net basis could impact the operating margin percentage by an estimated 25 basis points in the second quarter and 35 basis points for the full year. However, we remain committed to our plans to generate 130 to 210 basis points of improvement in our operating margin this fiscal year as outlined at our investor day.","When we take into account currency it is also worth noting that net other expense of $39 million which is included in the operating margin, reflects about $55 million in reduced foreign-exchange gains versus the prior year. However, the elimination of the U.S. medical device tax offset that by an almost equal amount within net other expense. While we hedge into the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce earnings volatility from foreign-exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging-market currencies. As we have said before, that can create modest volatility in our margins. Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $179 million. At the end of the first quarter we had $32.1 billion in debt and $12.8 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. Our debt did increase by just under $1 billion as we issued short term debt to manage minor timing differences between sources and uses of cash.","Our non-GAAP, nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 15.7%. This was an improvement to our forecast as it included the benefit from several operational tax adjustments for the quarter. Free cash flow was $1.2 billion. We're deploying our capital strategically, consistently and with discipline with a balanced focus on reinvestment, debt reduction and return to our shareholders. We paid $599 million in dividends and repurchased in net $1.5 billion worth of ordinary shares in the first quarter. At quarter end we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 51 million shares.","First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.407 billion shares. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and deleveraging our balance sheet. As an S&P dividend aristocrat we expect to deliver dependable long term dividend growth. In June our board approved another double-digit increase to our dividend which brings our payout ratio to 40%. With regard to reinvestment, our investments, particularly M&A, must not only meet high financial return hurdles with minimal shareholder dilution but also provide a line of sight to improving outcomes and allow for Medtronic to add value. ","Before turning the call back to Omar, let me conclude by reiterating our outlook. Our revenue outlook and EPS guidance for FY '17 has not changed. We continue to expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency, constant weeks basis which excludes the estimated negative $450 million impact from the extra selling week we had in the first quarter of last fiscal year. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we predict, if current exchange rates which include EUR1.13 and JPY100 remain stable for the remainder of the fiscal year, our full-year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $275 million to $325 million. With respect to earnings, we expect FY '17 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 16% after adjusting for the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 impact from the extra week last fiscal year as well as a negative foreign currency impact of $0.20 to $0.25. This EPS growth implies non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.60 to $4.70. All of this is in line with prior guidance. ","Looking at the second quarter only, we expect our revenue growth to be within our full-year growth range of 5% to 6% and our EPS growth to be in the lower half of our full-year growth range of 12% to 16%, both on a constant currency basis. Again, while currency impact is not something we predict, if exchange rates remain stable, we estimate our second quarter revenue would be positively affected by $25 million to $75 million. Other than as noted, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings doing the fiscal year. We feel good about the performance of our operations, the overall state of our markets, the diversification of our portfolio and geographies and our ability to execute. All of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our annual and long term commitment. As you know, our focus is to consistently deliver revenue growth in the mid single-digits and EPS growth in the double-digits on a constant currency basis. Our guidance for this fiscal year remains consistent with that long term focus. Omar? ","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen. And we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of our Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. [Operator Instructions]. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan in our investor relations team after the call. Operator, first question please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan","Mike Weinstein","Just maybe Omar I want to do start with HeartWare could you just spend a minute on why now on HeartWare that was the biggest question people had is people understand the franchise but why did you do the transaction today and then second there was obviously some dilution that comes with buying HeartWare given the burn in the company how did you offset that? ","Omar Ishrak","Okay why now well you know when you deal with their opportunistic elements which can come through so that was clearly one, the other is we really felt that we were in a position where we were getting critical mass around our expertise in heart failure and where HeartWare was positioned as a company we felt that we could add immediate value and through that combination drive up significant revenue not only in the first year but in the next couple of years through real sort of milestones that the company can meet such as reaching approval for destination therapy and then other new products so that was we felt a good timing for us.","And besides you can't plan acquisitions to the month period, it depends on a variety of circumstances and things just fell into place. We felt we had the management bandwidth to do this the team was well-prepared, we had the right capabilities and we had additional synergies that we could add in many different ways. So we felt this was absolutely the right time. And in terms of the dilution that obviously comes along with an acquisition this size, there are offset to the cardiac and vascular group made that unless Mike is going to comment on the overall thing on that. ","Mike Coyle","Sure, Mike, obviously we had a number investments internally going on in R&D programs directed specifically at heart failure including diagnostic programs and services as well as enhancements to our CRT product lines and we basically are reallocating resources and people to support the activities within HeartWare and backing off on some of those because we actually think HeartWare return on investment will be even better. ","Mike Weinstein","If I could just ask two quick follow-ups. Mike this was a tougher quarter for the traditional ICD business for the high power business, could you just comment on that and I was wondering if Hooman could comment on 670G timing in light of the 630 approval. Thanks.","Mike Coyle","As a relates to ICD or think probably the thing that is impacting the overall market is U.S. replacements and that we saw pretty stable low single-digit growth in initial implants for ICDs but we\u2019re now getting to a point where year-over-year comparisons on frankly replacements are down and sort of the low double-digit kind of range which is obviously a function of what's patents to initial implants 5 to 8 years ago depending what you're talking about CRT to standardize CDs.","So that's obviously putting some strain on the overall market growth. We actually took share in the ICD market as we continue to get the benefit of the MRI safe technologies rolling into not just the standard ICD's but also into CRT-D. And that's something that we think we can continue, we think we are very much in the front end of basically the mix shift toward use of MRI in standard high-powered and into CRT-D and we also obviously have a very robust set of new products that are just hitting the market and will be added to over the course of the next several quarters including the Visia AF and a single chamber segment as well as the Clary's [ph] CRT-D device which adds the effective CRT algorithm to our overall set of offerings.","So we think -- obviously the market is going to provide a bit of a head wind because of the replacements but we think we\u2019re in a good position to continue to take share and mitigate some of that. I was particularly encouraging to me that we could get to that mid single-digit growth when we\u2019re seeing that kind of stress metrics in the ICD market but obviously we\u2019re in a little bit of an off segment on our DES market as well and yet are able to still get into mid-single-digit growth so we think it speaks to the importance and value of the breadth of the portfolio. ","Hooman Hakami","Yes with respective 670 Mike, the PMA is with the FDA, it's really hard to predict when they're going to improve it obviously it's in their hands now. We are working actively with them to answer the questions that they have regarding our submission but as you know and as Omar talked about in the commentary in the meantime we launched the 630G we received approval and have launched the 630G and we're excited about this. This is going to address some of the biggest requests we've seen from patients color screen waterproofs remote [indiscernible] capability and so it's a chance for us to really bring additional enhancements to our patients while the 670 process goes on. So we\u2019re excited about the new product that we have and in the meantime we\u2019re working actively with the FDA on the 670. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Just a couple of questions here. Omar the last four quarters as you know organic growth has been extremely stable within Medtronic, in this quarter there were a couple of areas Mike mentioned one of them but the stem [ph] franchise U.S. geography broadly at a little bit the emerging market geography what if you could sort of address those few areas and may be a couple different people but just more specifically after that four quarters of significant stability of organic growth can that organic growth number get better here over the next several quarters and I have a quick follow-up after that. ","Kevin Miller","Well you know look we've always said that one of our main strength is the diversity of not only our portfolio but our geographic presence as well as the nature of the sources of revenue that we have from emerging markets from services solutions and new therapies. And that by definition means that there will be areas which are strong one quarter and week in others but overall we're pretty confident, very confident that we can maintain even just organically the mid-single-digit range within the full range of mid single-digits. We expect acquisition to supplement that and give us more confidence in holding that range but our new product introduction and so on as well as our geographic extension should enable us to that.","Now specifically to your question, you know we would really bit of a down product cycle if you like in the U.S. where most of our new products have the biggest impact. We think we'll get up bonus of new products in the coming quarters and that will pick it up again but the slight drop in U.S. revenue from our typically we've been doing about 4 to 3 this quarter is primarily that. We think in many areas we continue to show strength particularly in surgical procedures and within the MITG portfolio and that really hasn't changed. And like Mike pointed out a little earlier we\u2019re in a down product cycle actually both in cardiac and in diabetes which we think will come back in the next few quarters. So that\u2019s the dynamics in the U.S. market and new therapies. ","And also you know the other thing that I would like to point out is RTG, our restorative therapies growth led by Spine which we're watching very carefully, we're encouraged to see good strength there or early strength, I mean it's -- we've got to demonstrate sustained capability of mid single-digit growth there but we're pleased to see the way that RTG is moving now and offsetting pressures even in that portfolio with strength in other areas.","And in an emerging markets actually again we\u2019re quite pleased, we\u2019re trying to -- went through all kinds of gyrations in the last two years if you like and through that we've maintained either double-digit growth plus and minus is a little bit in that geography and then the other geographies have balanced each other out. I mean Middle East and Africa has been a very strong contributor of emerging market growth over the last several orders. This quarter there were conditions there but then other geographies such as Latin America showed considerable strength and China for that matter to offset that.","So we\u2019re very confident that the projection that we made of sort of low to mid teens double-digit growth in the emerging markets is something that is quite sustainable despite macroeconomic challenges that may come about. I think I covered your points David. ","David Lewis","You did Omar, thank you. And just a quick follow-up on earnings and margins broadly for Karen and the broader team. So just to avoid any confusion we've had a last couple of quarters, your commentary Karen thinking about consensus in the second quarter earnings number we kind of come around kind of a 150 number plus or minus a penny I wonder if could just comment about your comfortability with the consensus or that number and then just broadly if you take a step back from the analyst day, margins were the real focus and I wonder you're giving us 12% to 16% for this year but your confidence that we continue to see the durability of that 12% to 16% or sort of mid-teens earnings growth and of all those plans and restructuring plans you referred to when does the investor really start to see the inflection in this plan where they could really get this sense of the sustainability of this long term double-digit teens profile. Thank you. ","Karen Parkhill","Thanks David. I don't comment specifically on consensus numbers but happy for any of you to follow up with Ryan to go through your models at any point in time. In terms of our confidence in delivering our long term bottom line EPS growth I think this company has a very strong ability and we're very confident in our ability to deliver our commitment. Not only do we have significant growth on the top line particularly from emerging markets as Omar noted, but we have been driving strong synergies from the Covidien acquisition and we're focused on delivering additional leverage of beyond the Covidien acquisition through significant focus on managing our cost efficiently and I feel we\u2019re very confident in our ability to do just that. ","Omar Ishrak","I think maybe if I could just add to that your question about when to watch for inflection points, well listen like we've said before the Covidien synergies if we hit our $850 million projection that alone takes us through the double-digit EPS sort of projection. I mean by definition in FY '17 and mostly in FY '18. Now as we transition beyond that, we're like I mentioned in the Investor Day working on other efficiency programs in operations and in functions and many other areas which will then sustain that level. So those programs that we worked on right now but clearly the real results will prove themselves beyond FY '17. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. ","Bob Hopkins","So just two quick questions one is just to clarify question on the revenue growth guidance for 2017 you know given that now you've closed HeartWare. I hear you specifically on the upper end of the mid-single-digit range but I'm just curious does M&A add about a point to growth for 2017 given all the deals that have happened? ","Omar Ishrak","Well yes I mean if you have the deals up its something like that probably a little less than that but you know the main point though here is that the range that we projected really balances out issues that may arise, market issues and other issues that arise in our business. We feel confident that even organically that we will be in the mid-single-digit range and the whole range. And we feel that acquisitions give us increased confidence that we will hit that and probably in the higher end of that range I mean certainly this year with HeartWare we've got increased confidence for that. But that's the way in which we're looking at this. You know it's probably if you want to direct answer to your question is probably slightly under a point that the acquisitions are adding but things roll off other things come in, it's pretty dynamic picture and believe it or not there are some divestitures as well like the drug business and other things that grow out of our portfolio. So net-net it's probably a little less than a full point. ","Karen Parkhill","And Bob we did say that this quarter net M&A added about 70 basis points this quarter. ","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you. No, I understand the philosophy around the guidance I just wanted to make sure I had a good understanding of all the moving parts. And then for second question just on the product side I was wondering if Mike could talk a little bit about the upcoming MRI safe competition, we\u2019ve started to see a little bit of that roll-in just Mike your confidence in mid-single-digit growth now that we're about to see a steady cadence of MRI safe competition and then quickly on the diabetes side I heard the timelines for 670G but I just want to make sure there's no change in timelines on 670G from your perspective?","Mike Coyle","So on MRI, we obviously think this should become standard of care and right now if you just look at the most mature products we have in that segment are in a dual chamber pacing area and there the mix is still in the U.S. which is the most developed market in the sense or still -- only 70% of our business is actually MRI safe and recognizing that we're just a little over half the pacing business that means that less than half of the patients we\u2019re getting pacemakers in the United States that are getting MRI safe devices and as you go into the other product lines ICD's it's more like a 50% penetration rate for us when you get to CRT-D it's more like a 30% penetration rate for us or mix for us. So these penetration rates are very low and so we still think there's plenty of upside to go in those spaces, but as competitors catch up to this which still we have got it's only happening on the [indiscernible] side right now and is expected to take still several quarters into next year next calendar year before we see ICD competition CRT-D competition in those areas. ","We're continuing to advance the bulk. I mean obviously on the pacing side it's Micra right where we basically have an opportunity to significantly shift to very much value-added product in a single chamber segment as we get our reimbursement in place for that which is going to happen before the end of the fiscal year. In the standard ICD segment for single chamber the addition of Visia AF is being very well received in the marketplace. It is the only single chamber device that could actually do monitoring of atrial fibrillation without having a lead. So it gives a very significant benefit beyond simply the MRI safe characteristics of the products. And then in the CRT-D side we're obviously adding significant therapeutic value with things like adaptive CRT and effective CRT which basically improve response rates in CRT and because our hardware platforms Amplia in particular are basically positioned to be able to do multi-point pacing. We're going to add multi-point pacing capability to that Amplia product with software downloads below the end of the fiscal year. So we continue to advance the offerings that we have beyond MRI as competitors catch up in MRI. ","Omar Ishrak","And in terms of diabetes the 670G is on track but Hooman do you want to say a couple of words on that?","Hooman Hakami","Sure. There's absolutely no change or any indication that things are going to push out on the 670G and may be Bob just an additional point of clarification we didn't launch the 630 because we thought there was a risk to the 670 timeline. So the 670 is as I said we're working very, very closely with the FDA, the relationship is outstanding and we\u2019re actively engaged with -- we launched the 630 not due to anything related to the 670 but because of two things. One it gives our patients the request that they've asked for and I touched on what some of those were from waterproof to color screen and at the same time what it does is it refreshes our product line in the U.S. the 530G was launched in September of 2013 that\u2019s three years ago. And we held our own with this product even at this long anniversary but if you take a look at how well the 640 has done outside the United States, we felt that by bringing these patient centric features and a new hardware platform into the U.S. now, we could really refresh our product line and really drive growth in the U.S. while we wait for the 670. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. ","Kristen Stewart","I was wondering if you could just I guess take a step back and I guess since this is your first call just refresh us on I guess your thoughts on joining Medtronic and I know as mentioned before on the call, the operating margins has been a real big goal for Medtronic. I was wondering if you could just refresh us on the overall thoughts there and just again Medtronic from a broader sense on your enthusiasm on joining the team. ","Karen Parkhill","I'm thrilled to be a part of this great team. Medtronic is an amazing company with a very strong mission that clearly spoke to me personally. I think we're a leader in the industry from a vision perspective and I'm excited to be at a company that is leading not just, not just the medical device industry but the healthcare industry in general and I'm thrilled to be at a team where we're focused on growth and efficiency. In terms specifically of the operating margin as you know our focus is to drive a stronger growth in our bottom line and we have in our top line and the only way you do that is through efficiency in our margins.","We're very focused on that we talked about driving the Covidien synergies through to completion and ultimately achieving the $850 million commitment that we have put out there. And then on top of that, as we said we're focused on driving efficiencies throughout the company looking at all of our processing, bringing in lean Six Sigma to make us better and more efficient, centralizing resources where we can and ultimately driving double-digit bottom-line growth which is much stronger than a very impressive mid-single-digit top line growth. ","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then just I guess from your perspective where do you think that you're going to add the most value from Medtronic and can you just give us your thoughts on capital deployment and how you look at the lens of with M&A. ","Karen Parkhill","Sure. I'm happy to talk about those. I'm excited to step into the very big shoes of Gary and I intend to steer the ship very much in the same direction that he has. I do come from a financial industry background most recently though I've had experience in many industries within financial services obviously one of the key things that we had been doing in an ultra-low rate environment was focused on efficiency and driving strong bottom-line. And so that's exactly what we'll be doing here.","In terms of capital deployment, I think the highest and best use of our capital is to grow the intrinsic value of the company through reinvestment first and foremost, but beyond that I think it's very important to have a dividend that is strong and that does steadily grow with earnings and then on top of that, where we can have meaningful pay back to our shareholders through share repurchase and that's exactly what we're doing with our commitment to deliver a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of share repurchase. In addition to the ability of us on trapping more cash we have an additional $5 billion commitment over a three-year period from FY '16 to FY '18. So obviously I firmly believe in all that we're doing with the company and hope that helps. ","Omar Ishrak","Let me also add, look it's a pleasure to welcome Karen onto the team. She's made a great start and really -- if nothing else we value the fresh thinking and a fresh angle that is very useful for us as we go forward. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Omar, I wanted to start with a big picture question for you. In calendar Q1 2016, it was generally a strong quarter for the largest med-tech companies, we actually found acceleration in the weighted average of organic growth for the large [indiscernible] 5% to 6% depending on whether it include Edwards and Intuitive. So the question I have for you is what you think is driving improvement in the industry growth, how sustainable is it -- could you actually see growth improve for the industry from here or do you think 5% to 6% is the new norm and then I had a follow-up. ","Omar Ishrak","Look you know the industry is very broad so to be specific about this stuff but just a few reflections on this. First of all, if you're in healthcare your entitlement is growth because the opportunities in healthcare are limitless. If you look at it both from a medical innovation perspectives, the number of problems that have to be solved that patients will value, that create a real difference in people's lives driving equity in healthcare around the world. The opportunities there are again limitless and we're just scratching the surface and then on top of that you know like we've talked about the challenge of addressing wastage in healthcare where we\u2019re literally wasting across the world hundreds of billions of dollars in total healthcare spend which -- of which there's inefficiency in deliveries primarily because of payment models and so on around the world.","So if you look at all that collectively, the fact that the healthcare industry is growing is really not a surprise in many ways. It's an entitlement that the healthcare industry should have. And I think the fact that there was momentum this last quarter and last couple of quarters I mean that's -- it's too tough to call on something with that short a timeline but I've every expectation that all stakeholders in healthcare if they get their heads around these opportunities will steady increase in the growth profile in healthcare I think that's our entitlement. I think that's the only real comment I can make. I think all the companies that you listed are good companies with innovation driving and creating new markets. We expect to be an equal player in many of those areas, but there are lots of people out there with great sense of purpose and inventiveness in driving the solution. So again I just put it in the perspective of overall healthcare this is not one that should ever be a down market if we as players and stakeholders in the healthcare market can get our heads around this. ","Larry Biegelsen","And Mike, the intermediate risk indication for CoreValve in the Ce Mark [ph] approval came earlier than people expected, what do you think the implications are for the market and for CoreValve for that intermediate risk indication and just Karen the net other expense or income for the remainder of the year it was a little bit lower this quarter than we expected and the catch rate as well, could you comment on that please. Thanks a lot. ","Mike Coyle","As it relates to intermediate risk we were certainly expecting these developments both in terms of [Technical Difficulty] Edwards approval in the United States. We reflected that in our estimates for the overall market which we showed at the analyst meeting. So I wouldn't necessarily change what we said at that time. Other than to say it's obviously good to see these developments tending to happen sooner rather than later in terms of regulatory organizations looking at these compelling data and basically making sure these technologies are available to patients in the intermediate risk group and so we look forward to obviously finishing the [indiscernible] study working with the FDA to get label indications for that in the United States and we think the growth profile will be overall [indiscernible] market which was very robust in Q1 is going to continue to be a very impressive driver of growth for us and for Medtec in general. ","Karen Parkhill","Yes on net other expense we did mention the fact that our medical device tax does flow through that line item and obviously that was down year-over-year about $55 million. We did have currency gains that run through that line item as well. Those were down year-over-year too. In terms of our tax rate we did have several discrete tax benefits in the quarter that did push our overall tax rate down to 15.7% for the year. We do still do expect our tax rate to be within the range that we talked about before of 16.5% to 17.5%. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ","Bruce Nudell","Omar, we recently revisited the surgical practice patterns in orthopedics and some things don't seem to change. There seems to be just some [Technical Difficulty] for the status quo and some of the intricacies of gaining share in terms of repacing of internal savings pose another impediment to change. Should we be thinking about Medtronic's orthopedic initiative principally on the basis of broad solutions including management of patients and post-acute care or is really the implant side of the business really seminal to your thinking?","Omar Ishrak","No, I think it's a former, it is a broad solution that is necessary and we feel that there is a lot of cost I mean the majority of cost in that overall episode is actually in the post-acute space and so we think we can make a considerable difference but let's not just put that in a single bucket because in overall process includes proper risk stratification of the patients and that risk stratification drives a very specific care pathway to which adherents must be made and then following that, a clear handoff to post-acute care in the most efficient manner possible and finally a clear measurement and accountability for the outcome of the patient. Those four things that I've just outlined are not things that today are look at holistically. And I think in each one of those areas there's considerable inefficiency and we believe that putting technology and using technology will not only create an inflection point, in the short term, but will actually create long term sustainability of savings in that process because as you improve outcomes, you improve your cohort selection and risk stratification.","Your care pathways improve and then through all of that implants will play a role in terms of providing the most effective implant at the appropriate cost and when there is innovation in those areas we use them to drive up outcomes. So that\u2019s the way we look at it but you have to start with the holistic view and implant is only a portion of that and that\u2019s our view. Geoff, do you want to add anything to that quick ","Geoffrey Martha","No I think you're right if we look at this holistic view we look at it in several areas like the segmentation of the patients and the risk analytics, the pre-procedure patient engagement and education. The inner operative technologies not just the implants but different surgical tools that can be used that can lower the procedure cost during the hospital stay or downstream. And then the post-acute remote patient monitoring and then finally the patient reported outcomes the data collection reporting on that and look, we're seeing examples for example I was just with our Advanced Energy business yesterday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire and they have the technology that almost adds almost $500 to the cost of the procedure and when they -- over the last year with the advent of knowing that CGR was coming they really had to -- they revamped their go to market strategy, did that patient segmentation that Omar was talking about was very clear to the surgeon partners and the health systems they are selling into, what patient cohorts the hemostasis technology, what patient cohorts that added value to downstream and what it did not. Okay? So they did that patient segmentation, they published some papers on the value of the technology downstream for those courts in patients both clinically and economically and they have seen a big boost in their business.","So we\u2019re seeing the impact when you look at it holistically you can document and I think it's a matter of time you'll see certain technologies separate themselves that way both good and bad, up and down and so I take your point on the I guess the -- what would you call the built-in forces that are keeping things stable but I think over time as hospitals and health systems and payers become more sophisticated in looking at this holistic approach and looking at the clinical and economic impact across the 90 day period in this case I think you're going to see separation. I just don't think people have fully grasped it yet. ","Bruce Nudell","And just a follow-up for Mike. Mike, you know there were reports of vascular injuries with CoreValve, I'm presuming that was mainly it's training issue not a class affect related to the longer size of the self-expanding kind of devices. And a second follow-up on I'm presuming you pull the trigger on HeartWare being pretty comfortable with HVAC, it's going to be competitive until the pipeline evolves and just any thoughts you might have on the pipeline. ","Mike Coyle","Sure. So on the field action we took obviously we monitor all the patients that are being treated with our products and in that particular case we saw some overlap between specific anatomic issues and an increase in vascular trauma. So it was in fact only about training that this field action was done, it was to improve sensitivity to those particular aspects when screening patients and making sure that care is taken in terms of the delivery of the device. I would point out that our instance of vascular injuries actually below what is in the TBT registry. So we have a low threshold for identifying these issues and what we think we can help improve outcomes we obviously take action to do it.","So there was no change to the product, there were no issues with manufacturing, it basically was a training issue. On HeartWare obviously we're very bullish on the HVAC system as it is we think that device it performed very well, we were obviously able to see details of the clinical evidence that they generated in support of their U.S. approval in advance of making the decision to acquire the company and I think you\u2019ve seen especially in their most recent quarterly earnings results that in Europe there is beginning to see after the initial trial a nice bounce back in terms of overall share which obviously is consistent with our view that this product with its smaller size and its performance characteristics should be able to compete very effectively in that space.","We continue to look at the MVAD device and decide how aggressively we want to pursue that and we're working closely with the leadership team there, very impressed with the people who are doing that work and we look forward to being a leader in this space for decades to come. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar, Evercore ISI. ","Vijay Kumar","So maybe one I had a guidance clarification question and one follow-up. I guess when you look at sequentially 1Q versus 2Q, 1Q we came at the high end on a constant currency constant week EPS growth. 2Q was sort of looking at the bottom end of the 12% to 14% range, so can you just talk to sort of what changed in 1Q and 2Q and when I look at the annual guidance rate 1Q revenues came in 200 basis points above internal plans, So if we\u2019re looking at low half of the annual sort of 5% to 6% but we came in north of 5% and so revenues came in better in 1Q but I'm just curious why how EPS we sort of re-created on the EPS guidance. ","Karen Parkhill","In terms of first quarter versus second quarter yes our first quarter we did come in at the high end of that 12% to 16% growth range and we did give guidance that we expect second quarter to be at the low end of that 12% to 16% range. The key reason is the tax rate. We expect our tax rate from the second quarter last year to second quarter this year to be about 50 basis points higher. In terms of revenue growth rate, obviously we do expect our second quarter to be in the same line as our overall annual growth rate of 5% to 6%. Clearly we've got the HeartWare acquisition closing that gives us confidence around that range. ","Vijay Kumar","And then maybe one follow-up, I guess a lot of questions have been asked but I'm just curious maybe if Mike can answer this have you had conversations with the FDA on whether they would accept a one-year data for CoreValve given we have notion, we have subgroup analysis of high risk and your peer [indiscernible] just got approval based on one year data and if you had those conversations what's been the response? Thank you. ","Omar Ishrak","Obviously it's always a very fluid discussion with FDA and I have been very impressed with the way they have adapted their views in the TAVR space to the quality of the clinical evidence and have been flexible in terms of timing on approvals in the space generally I think we saw that again with Edwards and we had approval and so this group I think is extremely effective at balancing the therapeutic benefit of products with their risk and trying to get good new therapies to the market as quickly as they can.","So we will as you point out continued to basically look at one year and two year cuts on the data. There was a large number of patients that we have, we've obviously completed enrollment. As we have said we expect around ACC to be reviewing those data publicly and obviously we'll continue to work with the FDA and they will ultimately be the one to decide when the product is approved. ","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thanks to all of you for your questions and in conclusion, let me just reiterate that we're focused and consistently delivering on our three commitments mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth, double-digit constant currency EPS growth and returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders. ","And as I noted earlier we feel that the appropriate application of medical technology that can help address inefficiencies and improve outcomes in healthcare delivery driving new forms of value creation. With our differentiated growth platforms and leadership in the strong end markets we believe that we're well positioned to capture this to ultimately create a long term dependable value for our shareholders.","With that and on behalf of our entire management team I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you in our progress on our Q2 call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, November 22nd. Thank you all and have a great day. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14036":["Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) Q4 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call June  2, 2015  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Warren - Vice President, Investor Relations","Omar Ishrak - Chairman and CEO","Gary Ellis - Chief Financial Officer","Mike Coyle - President, Cardiac and Vascular Group","Bryan Hanson - President, Minimally Invasive Therapies Group","Chris O'Connell - President, Restorative Therapies Group","Hooman Hakami - President, Diabetes Group","Analysts","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","David Roman - Goldman Sachs","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Matt Taylor - Barclays","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Matt Keeler - Credit Suisse","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to Medtronic\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir?","Jeff Warren","Thank you, Maria. Good morning. And welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2015, which ended April 24, 2015. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary, which finalizes the preliminary revenue we issued on May 19, 2015.","We also updated our combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement presentation to include FY15 comparable revenue, as well as combined P&L for the past eight quarters.","You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com.","Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full year 2014, respectively, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which includes Covidien Plc and the prior year comparison and aligns Covidien\u2019s prior year monthly revenue to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal quarters.","With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.3 billion, which represents growth of 7% and Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16.","Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I would like to recap the fiscal year. FY15 was a transformational year for our company, with the announcement of the Covidien acquisition in Q1 and the subsequent closing of this transaction in Q4.","We believe the combination of our two companies meaning accelerates our strategies, diversifies our growth profile and increases our long-term financial flexibility. I will cover the Covidien integration in more detail in a moment.","Our FY15 revenue grew 6%, which was at the upper end of our mid single-digit baseline goal and represented a 230 basis point improvement from FY14. FY15 was a strong year for therapy innovation at Medtronic, with our new therapies growth vector contributing 410 basis points for our full year growth, well above our stated goal of 150 to 350 basis points.","All four of our groups launched meaningful innovations in FY15, including those that make advances into disease areas, innovate in our existing market-leading technologies or enhance our diagnostic, therapy and monitoring products with key wraparound programs. Gary will discuss the technologies that drove our results, as well as our future pipeline in more detail shortly when he recaps our business results.","Revenue in emerging markets our second growth vector grew double digits again in FY15 and contributed 150 basis points to our full year growth.","Our third growth vector, services and solutions nearly doubled in revenue in FY15 and 30 basis points to our full year growth. While legacy Covidien businesses were no doubt contribute to this vector in the future, we feel for FY15 it is more appropriate to look at this vector using the legacy Medtronic revenue as the base given all of the revenue in Q4 came from legacy Medtronic businesses, under this methodology the services and solutions group vector contributed 50 basis points within our FY15 goal of 40 to 60 basis points.","We continue to add additional services and solutions offerings. In addition to our existing Cardiocom and Cath Lab Managed Services platforms, we were excited to add Diabeter in Q4, a unique diabetes integrated care solution.","We also initiated our first pilot of our Operating Room Managed Services, which combines the capabilities we have developed in the Cath Lab together with Covidien\u2019s breathe pf operating room technology and expertise to provide a full service or our offering to hospitals.","All of these efforts are focused in addressing the evolving needs of our customers regarding delivery system efficiency and more integrated connected care models for patients around the world.","We feel we are well-positioned to demonstrate the role medical technology and related services can play in improving system efficiency and care integration in key disease states and to serve with the key partner and collaborator with healthcare systems spares, governments and governments for working to deliver better patient outcomes at lower costs.","Looking at the FY15 P&L, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. While it is difficult to compare EPS to the prior year, given the acquisition of Covidien, we are looking at some key operating P&L line items in an approximate combined constant currency basis in order to better assess our operating performance. We also feel that these would be the appropriate P&L metrics to evaluate our operating performance as we move through FY16.","In FY15, our operating margin percentage improved by 60 basis points, including an 80 basis points improvement in SG&A, offset by 50 basis point decline in gross margins all on a combined constant currency basis, which corresponds to a 200 points of operating leverage and was in line with our baseline expectations.","While Gary will cover our earnings guidance in a moment, it is clear that FX is a major headwind in FY16. Despite that headwind, I want to emphasize that the management team is focused on driving significant operating leverage this year.","Looking now at free cash flow, we had a very strong year in FY15 and met our commitment to return 50% for our free cash flow in the form of dividends and share buybacks.","Our FY15 results ultimately reflect the dedication and passion of over 85,000 employees collaborating with our partners in healthcare to deliver therapies and services to millions of patients around the globe to fulfill our mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life.","Now moving to our Q4 performance, Q4 was another strong quarter, the first as a combined company with Covidien. Our 7% revenue growth was a result of solid performances across all of our groups and geographies. Geographically, we had double-digit growth in emerging markets, strong upper single-digit growth in the U.S. and mid single-digit growth in developed markets outside the U.S.","CVG had another quarter of impressive double-digit growth, diabetes delivered strong upper single-digit growth on both MITG and RTG had solid mid single-digit growth. In RTG, we recently reorganized the structure of our sales teams, aligning sales management to disease states.","We expect this to further optimize our focus on our neuroscience, integrated pain solutions and surgical synergy strategies. In particular we believe this should help our performance in spine, as we believe it will allow us to take better advantage of our overall breathe.","Q4 was a first quarter of integration with Covidien, while it has only been one quarter, I'm proud that our combined organization is staying focused and delivering on our commitments, avoiding any distractions during this transition period.","As I\u2019ve stated several times before, our first objective with the Covidien integration is to preserve the state of growth objectives of both companies. As we look ahead, we believe that our baseline goal of delivering mid single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a consistent basis is still appropriate and reasonable over the long-term. Although, similar to this quarter that could well be times when we exceed our baseline expectations.","We continue to focus in executing on our three growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. These strategies are designed to create a competitive advantage for Medtronic by capitalizing on the three long-term trends we see playing out in healthcare. Namely the desire to improve clinical outcomes using technology, the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare in developing countries and the optimization of cost efficiency in healthcare systems, including the move to value-based healthcare.","In therapy innovation, we continue to deliver above goal performance in Q4, as the new therapies growth vector contributed 560 basis points to our total company growth. This is a result of strong execution on product launches, as well as decisions we have made over the past few years to select the right products that solve not only our customers clinical needs but their economic needs as well, and as we look ahead, our pipeline remains full with the number of new therapies and services expected to come market over the next few years.","In globalization, emerging markets delivered 140 basis points to our Q4 total company growth, just below our stated expectations. We continue to implement changes aimed at improving our emerging market growth profile, including making progress in our public and private partnerships. On my most recent visit to China, I met with several private hospitals CEO\u2019s and discussed potential opportunities to work together.","In addition to partnerships, all of our emerging markets are focused on our channel optimization strategy, strengthening our customer relationships to better meet our customers\u2019 needs, while also recognizing the unique challenges of the local healthcare systems.","In countries like India and China, where we have a vast number of distributors, we are consolidating logistics to platform distributors in order to meet more stringent supply chain policies. In the Middle East, we are building strong joint venture partnerships with local distributors to accelerate therapy adoption in the local markets.","In economic value, our services and solutions growth vector contributed 50 basis points to our growth in Q4 on the legacy Medtronic basis, within the goal of 40 to 60 basis points. In Cardiocom, we signed an additional 14 commercial contracts in Q4 and continued to increase patient enrollment in our existing hospital and home care provider accounts.","In our CRHF Diagnostics business, we have begun penetrating the mobile cardiac, outpatient telemetry and NuVent report markets using our unique SEEQ based diagnostic service. We have now started adding the heart failure diagnostic data provided by CRHF implantable devices into Cardiocom creating a comprehensive heart failure management service.","We also started offering Cardiocom as part of a broader bundle offering to our CVG customers. In Cath Lab Managed Services we are generating rapid growth, as we are fast becoming the ideal partner for hospitals that seek to drive operational efficiency. While this business started in Europe we are now expanding our Cath Lab Managed Services business globally.","At the end of Q4, we had 50 long-term agreements with hospital systems, representing $1.1 billion in revenue over the life of these contracts, which have an average age -- average span of about five to six years. And we also have a full pipeline of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the world.","Turning to the P&L, Q4 non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.16. Despite the incremental moving parts due to the Covidien transaction and increased headwinds from foreign exchange, our operating results were in line with our expectations, with our organization controlling spending effectively as we ended the fiscal year.","Our gross margin continues to reflect ongoing elevated levels of spending to improve our quality systems in Neuromodulation. This quarter, we entered into a consent decree with the FDA, which provides a part to resolution of our issues in this division.","We take the responsibility that has been instructed to us to provide quality products very seriously and ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has and always will be a personal priority for me and a central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic.","We delivered $1.7 billion of free cash flow in Q4. We remained in allocating our capital with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value. As a result of the Covidien acquisition, we have increased ability to deploy our cash in the U.S., solidifying our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","With this increased financial flexibility, we are in the process of reevaluating the mix of share buybacks and dividends. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth.","In addition, we remained disciplined when evaluating potential M&A opportunities, any investment we make must be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, while at the same time offer high return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution.","As we look ahead to FY16, we remain focused on delivering on our baseline financial expectations as we continue to integrate Covidien into Medtronic. We have four clear priorities guiding this process, preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. I mentioned preserve earlier, our first and highest priority, and we expect to continue to meet the financial commitments of both companies.","Our second priority, optimize, is focused on achieving the detailed cost savings plans that are expected to result in a minimum of $850 million in cost synergies by the end of FY18.","Our third priority, accelerate, is related to assessing and prioritizing the numerous revenue synergy opportunities, which today include leveraging Covidien\u2019s peripheral vascular sales force to drive sales of drug-coated balloons, as well as leveraging Covidien's Neurovascular division to enhance our Neuroscience strategy in RTG.","We are creating the industry's first true comprehensive stroke management business, leveraging our transformative therapy innovations, the solitaire mechanical thrombectomy product in Neurovascular and CVG LINQ Insertable Cardiac Monitor, with its clinically proven role in the management of cryptogenic stroke patients.","Our fourth and final priority is transform, as we observe and interact with healthcare systems around the world, we continue to see a push for experimentation with new models of delivery system operations, new payment schemes and integrated patient care as a critical mechanism to balance their cost and access challenges.","Each of these efforts seek to drive higher levels of patients and system value, to move to this value-based healthcare models around the world presents a unique opportunity for Medtronic because we believe medical technology can play an increasing larger role in delivering higher levels of value in healthcare, the proper application of medical technology with and the adapt use of data and information associated with these technologies can be paired to help when the cost curve in healthcare and produce better clinical outcomes at the same time.","This is pushing our organization to develop technology offering, services and business models that bring new forms of value across a given patient care continuum and within the delivery system itself. This continues to drive our organization to move beyond medical devices to create integrated health solutions that complement and enhance our devices value, through traditional wraparound services and solutions.","By addressing these trends now, we believe we will also uniquely position Medtronic to participate in the emerging bundle payment and risk sharing models focused in very specific disease states.","We are actively partnering and collaborating with hospital systems, payers and governments who are working on these new models and we intend to continue to do so as leader intent and leveraging our industry-leading products, deep clinical and economic expertise, global footprint and financial strengths. Ultimately, we believe this is what will differentiate Medtronic and uniquely positions us to succeed in the ever-changing global healthcare marketplace.","Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary?","Gary Ellis","Thanks, Omar. Fourth quarter revenue of $7.34 billion increased 60%, as reported or 7% on a comparable, constant currency basis after adjusting for a $483 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Legacy acquisitions and divestitures from both Medtronic and Covidien contributed 80 basis points to growth.","Q4 revenue results on a geographic basis were as follows. Growth in the U.S. was 8% and represented 55% of our overall sales. The non-U.S. developed markets grew 5% and represented 32% of our overall sales and growth in the emerging markets was 11% and represented 13% of our overall sales.","Q4 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.16, a decrease of 2%. We will breakeven on a Q4 GAAP earnings basis after several significant charges primarily related to the Covidien acquisition. In addition to the $362 million adjustment for amortization expense, the Covidien related non-GAAP adjustments on an after-tax basis included a $455 million charge related to the inventory purchase price step-up, a $286 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $157 million net restructuring charge.","We also had a $349 million charge related to certain tax adjustments, the majority of which related to the proposed agreement reached with the IRS, resolving all proposed adjustments associated with the Kyphon acquisition, a $61 million CVG product technology upgrade commitment charge and a $27 million net litigation charge, primarily related to provision for additional INFUSE clients.","In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2,596 billion grew 10%. This was a result of strong performance in all three divisions -- Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, Coronary & Structural Heart, and Aortic & Peripheral Vascular. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure or CRHF, revenue of $1,398 billion grew 11%. This performance was driven by low-teens growth in Low Power, mid-single digit growth in High Power, strong growth of over a 30% in AF Solutions, as well as nearly doubling our revenue in services and solutions, which includes Cardiocom and Cath Lab Managed Service revenue.","We estimate the global CRHF market is growing in the low to mid-single digits and the strength of our new product introductions is resulting in share gains and generally improved pricing dynamics. Low Power growth continues to be driven by the global adoption of Reveal LINQ, which resulted in diagnostics revenue growth of over 40% sequentially as well as solid pacemaker implant growth in U.S. LINQ is resulting in not only increased diagnostic sales but also pacemaker pull-through, as LINQ is resulting in more re-cardiac diagnosis in syncope patients.","Looking forward -- looking ahead, we look forward to the launch of the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System in international markets this summer, followed by a U.S. launch in FY\u201917. In High Power, we continue to see strong market adoption of our Attain Performa, CRT-D system with its differentiated next-generation Quadripolar technology, AdaptivCRT algorithm and time-saving Vector Express programming.","High Power also had a strong quarter in Japan, where we have now gained over 20 points of ICD share since the launch of our Evera MRI SureScan ICD in Q3. We expect to launch the Evera MRI ICD in the U.S. in this fiscal year. Our AF Solutions business continues to take share in the AF market and the continued strong growth of our Arctic Front Advance Cryoablation System, which is growing at more than double of the overall market growth rate.","Turning to Coronary & Structural Heart or CSH, revenue of $792 million grew 9%. Our coronary business grew in the low single-digits driven by solid mid-single growth in drug-eluting stents. In Europe, our launch of the Resolute Onyx resulted in a 400 basis points of DES share gains sequentially and a sequential slowing of pricing declines. Resolute Onyx feature enhanced visibility and thinner struts to improve deliverability. We began the U.S. pivotal trial for Resolute Onyx in March and are currently forecasting an FY\u201918 FDA approval.","In our broader coronary product offering, we are also seeing increased strengths, particularly in balloons where we gained 400 basis points of share on the successful rollout of our differentiated Euphora PTCA balloon family. In renal denervation, we announced in April, the initiation of the SPYRAL HTN global clinical trial program, which includes two global, prospective, randomized, sham-controlled trials studying uncontrolled hypertension patients both on and off medication. Based on the outcome of these two initial studies, we will then evaluate next steps for our pivotal study.","Our Structural Heart business grew in the upper teens, driven by another strong quarter in transcatheter valves, which grew nearly 50%. In the U.S., our continued rollout of CoreValve is driving growth and resulting in both sequential and year-over-year share gains. We added approximately 40 additional new centers in the quarter and now have more than 275 U.S. centers trained since launch.","In late March, we received the FDA approval for the use of CoreValve in a failed bioprosthetic also known as valve-in-valve implantation and these further contributed to our U.S. growth. As CoreValve is the only TAVI product approved for this indication, it makes CoreValve an indispensable offering for every practicing TAVI center.","In international markets, our business took share sequentially due to the strong adoption of our CoreValve Evolut R. We are seeing strong customer enthusiasm for this next-generation self-expanding platform with its options to recapture and reposition the valve during the procedure. It\u2019s differentiated 14 French equivalent delivery catheter, allowing access to smaller amenities and as we design inflow and skirt to help promote annular sealing.","Evolut R is receiving tremendous feedback on its clinical outcomes, overall ease-of-use and procedural efficiencies. The FDA submission of Evolut R is complete and we are targeting the first half FY\u201916 approval in U.S. launch. The FDA also recently allowed us to begin implanting Evolut R in a SURTAVI Trial and to reduce the enrollment of requirement for the trial to 1,400 patients, which we believe brings in the timeline for the U.S. Intermediate Risk approval by at least a year.","We have already enrolled approximately 1,250 patients from SURTAVI and we expect to complete enrollment over the next several months. In Japan, we received PMDA approval for CoreValve in March and plans are underway for a full launch this fall, following anticipated reimbursement approval in October.","In our Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division or APV, revenue of $406 million grew 9%. The Aortic business grew in low-single digits and the peripheral vascular business grew the mid-teens, driven by the successful U.S. launch of our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon.","We estimate that the IN.PACT Admiral is the leading DCB in the U.S. market in just its first quarter of launch. This leadership position was attained without the benefit of having a full quarter of a combined Medtronic and legacy Covidien peripheral sales force. We expect this DCB to drive growth in our APV division over the coming quarters through both its individual revenue contribution, as well as its ability to drive share across our broader peripheral vascular product line through the use of multi-line contracting.","Looking on our DCB pipeline, we expect to obtain FDA approval for our 150 millimeter IN.PACT Admiral balloon in Q4 FY\u201916, or early Q1 FY\u201917. In addition, we expect to file for expanded indications for IN.PACT Admiral with a PMAs U.S. filing in the second half of FY\u201916 for in-stent restenosis indication, as well as the CE Mark filing by the end of FY16 for AV [indiscernible] indication. We are also finalizing bench testing now on our redesigned DCB for use below the knee, which we expect to submit for CE Mark in FY\u201916.","Now turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which consist of the majority of legacy Covidien businesses, revenue of $2.387 billion grew 6%, which included a net 140 basis point contribution from acquisitions and divestitures. MITG\u2019s revenue performance was driven by double-digit growth in Surgical Solutions and lower single-digit growth in Patient Monitoring & Recovery.","Surgical Solutions revenue of $1.293 billion grew 10%, with high single-digit growth in Advanced Surgical, low single-digit growth in General Surgical and growth of over 40% in Early Technologies. Advanced Surgical had a strong quarter with balanced low double-digit growth in both Stapling and Energy.","Stapling results benefited from the continued rollout of new products, including the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload. In Energy, we are seeing strong procedural growth, particularly in Vessel Sealing. Our Early Technologies business also had solid growth across all three product lines: GI Solutions, Advanced Ablation, and Interventional Lung Solutions. Geographically, in Surgical Solutions, both the U.S. and China had strong quarters, delivering double-digit growth. Surgical solutions continues to focus on driving minimally invasive surgery adoption globally.","Patient Monitoring & Recovery revenue of $1,094 billion grew 2%. The division was led by strength in the patient monitoring business, which grew in the mid-single digits as well as both Nursing Care and Airway & Ventilation, which grew in the low-single digits. This offset low single-digit declines in patient care. Growth in the patient monitoring business resulted from our strong U.S. flu season, which drove pulse oximetry sales.","Now moving to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1,854 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by growth in Surgical Technologies, Neuromodulation and Neurovascular, partially offset by modest declines in Spine. Spine revenue of $743 million declined 2%. Low single-digit growth in BMP was offset by low single-digit earnings in Core Spine and interventional.","Both the global and the U.S. Core Spine markets grew in the low single-digits, consistent with last quarter. In our Core Spine business, both TL and cervical declined. But both of these businesses are expected to improve as we continue to launch innovative technologies into the market and these new products become a larger part of our sales mix.","In PL, we are expecting FY\u201916 rollouts of new technologies for our OLIF25 and the 51 procedures, our new alleviate expendable cage and Solera Voyager, our new minimally invasive lumbar pedicle screw system. In cervical, we continued to see adoption of our PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and innovative ANATOMIC PTC interbody spacer. We are also now beginning the launch of our Divergence Stand-Alone Interbody Cage and ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System.","Our spine division also continues to develop and deploy our differentiated surgical synergy program, which integrates our enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants and expertise to improve surgical outcomes and efficiencies. This includes utilizing O-arm imaging and StealthStation navigation in spine procedures. And a strong growth from these two enabling technologies is recognized in our Surgical Technologies division.","In Neuromodulation, revenue of $518 million increased 6%, driven by double-digit growth in DBS and mid-teens growth in Gastro\/Uro. In DBS, our global growth focused on neurologist referral programs and the strength of the EARLYSTIM data in international markets continues to drive solid growth.","In Gastro\/Uro, we continue to see strong growth in sales of the InterStim system. Our Pain stim business was flat this quarter, reflecting a continued decline in the U.S. market, resulting from a negative reimbursement change that affected trialing activity and new implant growth.","However, we grew our global pain stim share sequentially on the strength of our RestoreSensor SureScan MRI, spinal cord stimulation system, with its proprietary AdaptiveStim automatic simulation adjustment feature and access to MRI scans anywhere in the body.","Turning to our Surgical Technologies division, revenue of $461 million grew 9%, driven by solid, balanced growth across all three businesses. Neurosurgery grew in the mid-single-digits, reflecting record worldwide O-arm surgical imaging unit sales, continued strength in StealthStation navigation service revenue, and the contribution of Visualase MRI-guided laser ablation.","ENT low-double digit growth was a result of continued strong customer adoption of our StraightShot M5 Microdebrider and NuVent sinus balloon, partially offset by the MicroFrance divestiture, which occurred in Q3. In Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies drove upper-teens growth.","In Neurovascular, revenue of $132 million grew 23%. The division, formerly part of legacy Covidien, had strong double-digit growth across coils, stents, flow diversion and access. In stents, we saw strong adoptions of our SOLITAIRE FR revascularization device following the presentation of four meaningful clinical trials at the International Stroke Conference in February and subsequent publication of three of these studies in the New England Journal of Medicine.","These studies provided evidence that the standard of care for the treatment of stroke should be changed to include stent thrombectomy as primary treatment in addition to IV-tPA. In our flow diversion portfolio, we also saw a strong growth as a result of continued U.S. launch of the Pipeline Flex embolization device.","In our Diabetes Group, revenue of $467 million grew 8%, with solid upper single-digit growth from the continued adoption of our CGM sensor augmented insulin pump systems in both the U.S. and non-US developed markets. In U.S., we continued to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 530G with the Enlite CGM sensor. In non-U.S. developed markets, growth was driven by the launch of our next-generation MiniMed 640G system with the enhanced Enlite CGM sensor in Australia and Europe.","In addition to incorporating a brand new insulin pump design and user interface, the MiniMed 640G System features SmartGuard technology, which can automatically suspend insulin delivery when sensor glucose levels are predicted to approach a low limit and then resume insulin delivery once levels recover. We continue to make progress in bringing this technology to the U.S. and plan to submit the PMA for this system later this calendar year.","In Q4, we continue to advance the development of artificial pancreas technology through a minority investment in DreaMed Diabetes, which included licensing their MD-Logic artificial pancreas algorithm. We also continue to make progress in our Diabetes Services and Solutions division with three business development announcements in Q4. First, we made a minority investment in Glooko, a developer of unified platform for diabetes management. Second, we announced a partnership with IBM Watson Health to develop a new generation of personalized diabetes management solutions. And third, we acquired Diabeter, the Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center, which has developed a truly unique, integrated care model for people with diabetes that we intend to expand globally over time.","Taken together, these announcements signify that we're focused on transforming our diabetes group from a market-leading pump and sensor company into a holistic diabetes management company focused on making a real difference in outcomes and costs.","Turning to the rest of the income statement. After adjusting for certain non-GAAP items mentioned earlier as well as the 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, our Q4 operating margin was 29.6%, which included non-GAAP operational gross margin, SG&A and R&D of 70.8%, 32.6%, and 6.9%, respectively demonstrating the leverage we normally see in the fourth quarter in SG&A and R&D. Also included in the operating margin was net other income of $20 million, including net gains from our hedging program of $139 million.","We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. In addition, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY16 net other expense to be in the range of $215 million to $275 million, which includes an expected impact from the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $205 million. For Q1 FY16, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $65 million to $75 million based on current exchange rates.","It is worth noting that in Q4 we hedged the majority of the expected FY16 legacy Covidien operating results in developed market currencies, consistent with Medtronic\u2019s practice at recent market rates. Overall, we expect FY16 operating margins to be in the range of 28% to 29% on an as reported basis, which includes over 100 basis points of improvement or approximately 400 basis points of operating leverage related to cost synergies offset by an expected FX impact of approximately 70 basis points.","The majority of the operating margin improvement will come in SG&A as a result of the realization of cost synergies from our Covidien acquisition as well as continued execution on legacy leverage initiatives of both Covidien and Medtronic. We would expect operating margins in the first half of the year to be below this range improving in the back half of the year as the foreign exchange headwinds lessen and cost synergies accelerate.","Below the operating profit line, Q4 net interest expense was $186 million, a significant increase from prior quarters as we are now including the incremental interest expense from our December 2014 $17 billion bond offering used in Covidien acquisition. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $19.5 billion in cash and investments and $36.2 billion in debt. In Q1, we expect to retire $1 billion of maturing debt using existing cash. Based on current rates, we would expect FY16 net interest expense to be approximately $750 million, including approximately $210 million in Q1.","Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 15.4%. This was lower than expected due primarily to the finalization of profit mix by jurisdiction, which resulted in a favorable catch up as we reduced our annual tax rate. We would expect our FY16 non-GAAP nominal tax rate on the cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 18% as we expect to be at the higher end of the range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated.","In Q4, we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow, excluding one-time items, to shareholders. In Q4, we repurchased $300 million of our common stock and paid $435 million in dividends. While a portion of our dividend paid in April was treated for U.S. tax purposes as a return of capital, our expectation is that we will increasingly accumulate profits at the Medtronic plc level and move over time toward a dividend that is treated completely as a return of their earnings.","As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 30 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.441 billion shares. It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemptions, which was $172 million in Q4, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","For FY16, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of approximately 1.433 billion to 1.437 billion shares, including approximately 1.439 million shares in Q1.","Let me conclude by commenting on our initial fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We believe that underlying operational revenue growth in the range 4% to 6%, plus incremental expected revenue from our Q1 extra selling week of a 100 to 150 basis points all on a comparable constant currency basis is reasonable for FY16. This operational revenue growth expectation is consistent with our stated baseline financial goal of consistently delivering mid-single-digit revenue growth.","Our revenue outlook assumes that CVG, MITG, and RTG grow in the mid-single digits and diabetes grows in the upper-single to low-double digit range all on a comparable constant currency basis and including the expected benefit of the extra week. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you sense of the FX impact of the exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY16 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, including the negative $540 million to $600 million impact in Q1.","Turning to guidance on the bottomline, we believe it is reasonable to model cash earnings per share in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.40 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition.","As you think about your FY16 models and quarterly gating, it is worth noting that this FX impact to earnings per share is $0.10 more negative than we estimate given on our Q3 earnings call as well as the fact that a higher percentage of the negative FX impact is in the first half of the year while more of the value capture synergies occurred later in the fiscal year.","As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that Q4 was another strong quarter, a good finish to a successful and transformative year. As we look ahead, while we are facing increased headwinds from foreign exchange, we must remain focused in the operations of the company striving to reliably deliver on baseline financial model, mid-single digit constant currency revenue growth, EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue on an operational basis, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","To achieve these goals we continue to execute in our three primary strategies, therapy innovation, globalization, and the economic value. We expect our efforts to deliver consistent and reliable performance, combined with the disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long-term, dependable value in healthcare.","With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We are really able to get to everyone's questions so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning. And thanks everybody for taking the question. So Omar as a starting point, if I look at your U.S. business, this is certainly one of your better quarters in quite sometime at the company. And I was hoping you could touch on your view of the health of U.S. med device end markets. You obviously have at Medtronic a number of products to drive in specific Medtronic growth and linked to CoreValve across the portfolio. How do you feel about the health of the overall U.S. med device market? Do you think that it\u2019s picked up over the last few quarters?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. Of course it has, because if you just look overall the number of procedures, look at what hospital systems are reporting in terms of their procedures and our own experience, certainly the market has picked up. But I would add, like three factors, some of which you mentioned already, which is some contributed to our performance. First is that there is an overall pick up and stabilization in fact of the market and now I think so correlating directly with the increased expectation from demographics. So that\u2019s certainly there.","I think in addition, like you pointed out a convergence for our new products coming altogether at roughly the same time has given us a boost and there is no question about it. And finally, we haven't fully quantified it yet, but there is a pull-through effect of some of our implantable devices from very strong diagnostic monitoring sales, our LINQ device sales. We don\u2019t know how much that is, but I think the three of these put together, probably the main factors driving this increased growth in the U.S.","Mike Weinstein","Gary, let me get to the FY16 guidance. So the incremental impact on EPS from FX, the $0.10, is that in part because you hedged into quarter the Covidien exposure, at some point were less favorable rates? And then I assume from your commentary just about the timing of the impact of FX, the timing of the benefit of synergies, as well as your tax rate still and one more item that as we think about the earnings cadence over the course of 2016 that we probably should expect it to be more back half loaded? Thanks.","Gary Ellis","Yes, Mike, back to the -- on the foreign exchange, yes the majority of the $0.10 change from what we have previously estimated on the FX is primarily related to the fact that as we hedged Covidien in the fourth quarter, the rates were even lower than where we provide guidance originally on the $0.30 to $0.40. So yes, I mean, the fact is we did -- as get hit Covidien with our hedging program, but unfortunately by the time we got them in our hedging program, we were at probably -- the rates were similar to where we are at currently and that generated an additional loss from the standpoint of foreign exchange overall.","So that\u2019s the majority of the $0.10. So the rest of it is, there is some slight impact just from the standpoint that we don't hedge up to 100% of our even the Medtronic earnings, it\u2019s more like 80%. And so there were still some impact on the foreign exchange getting bit worse since their earnings call previously even on the Medtronic and their hedge component, but the majority of it was locking in Covidien under contracts that basically increased the potential negative hit going forward. Now the good news is they are locked in. So we need further change as we go forward obviously which should be minimized as a result of that.","As you indicated, as we look forward I think right now from what I have seen out there for some of the models, I think people have it probably little bit too much front-end loaded. There is going to be more based on the results as we go forward here. Foreign exchange is pretty much heavier hit in the first half of the year and assuming the rates stay the same will be less in the back half year. As you said the tax rate, they will be a little higher in the first until we get the R&D credit approved. And the value capture is going to occur as we go through the year. So that\u2019s clearly going to be escalating and we will have more benefit on value capture in the back half of the year. So I think some of the models are need to be shifting probably a little bit more from the first half to the second half on earnings per share guidance.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Perfect. I will let some others jump in. Thanks, guys.","Gary Ellis","Thanks, Mike.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with some of your comments that towards the end of the call regarding capital deployment. I know in the February call you had started to talk about a potential shift as it related to the mix of dividends and buybacks, the anticipation of the dividend update in June. I guess, A, is that so the case? And, B, any additional color you could provide around the major that shift at this point in time?","Omar Ishrak","Well, first, yes, we clearly are more flexibility as we have talked about several times with the increased access to overseas cash. And I think also our increased operating productivity that we will get from synergies is the factor that we have to consider. And so based on that, we are examining our overall capital allocation strategy and we are going to update you shortly on this in a pretty short timeframe. That\u2019s I think all I can share at this point.","David Roman","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on spine. I mean, this is a business that has ebbed and flowed over the past several quarters, but it does look like the overall end market has shown some signs of improvement at least over the past call it 12 months, so that\u2019s not something in which Medtronic has necessarily participated. Can you maybe go into a little bit more detail on exactly what the turnaround plan is for spine? And at what point you start to think about more significant changes in that business either the senior management or sales level?","Omar Ishrak","Well, number of points, first of all, from an overall perspective you are right the business itself, spine taking in isolation, hasn\u2019t quite kept up with the way the markets have trended at least in the last 12 months I would say.","But there is a short-term strategy to this, which is probably related to the timing of some of the new products which we will see it play through in the coming quarters here in the short-term.","Then the longer-term aspect of this and that we have always said that our strategy in that space is really an integrated strategy that uses our overall capabilities in capital equipment and in surgical tools together with spine to give us the competitive advantage.","And to that effect, we\u2019ve reorganized our commercial teams at the regional management level, that\u2019s already in placed. We\u2019ve done that both in the U.S. and in Europe, and we are going to -- we have to see how that plays out. I think that\u2019s really our strategy and we\u2019re going to monitor how we deliver on these two aspects in the coming quarters very closely.","Gary Ellis","Okay. Thank you, David.","David Roman","Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Gary, as maybe if you could just go into a little bit more on the tax rate, you\u2019d mentioned that during the quarter you had settled some related to Kyphon, I am not sure if that\u2019s all of the IRS settlement that you were referring to at the Investor Day last year?","And then also just on the guidance for the full year of 16% to 18%. Maybe just walk us through how you get there just given the fact that at least I was expecting the tax rate to be a little bit lower given some of the commentary that you had with Covidien post close with the rate dropping by about 200 basis points, not sure if it\u2019s related to those settlement there with the IRS.","Gary Ellis","Yeah. Okay. With respect to, first of all, the Kyphon aspect and the charge we took in the quarter related to Kyphon. This relates to an issue we\u2019ve had that was raised by the IRS related to our acquisition of Kyphon several years ago and which we used a combination of basically OUS cash and U.S. cash, the comparison there. There was a dispute on how much of that was taxable, et cetera.","So as you recall, we used about $3.3 billion of OUS cash to do that transaction. What we\u2019ve ended up agreeing with preliminary decision, the Board still has to approve this, but we agreed basically the settlement with the IRS where we ended up paying about $275 million to settle that and then interest on top of that gets you to the charge we took for the quarter overall.","This is not the transfer pricing, put it for transfer pricing issue that we\u2019ve talked about in some of the other previous meetings where which we\u2019ll have a significant impact on the cash flow going forward, this is kind of more of a one-off item related to the acquisition. But it was a major outstanding issue we had with the IRS and we\u2019re happy to get this when settled and move beyond it.","As far as the tax rate going forward, 16% to 18%, that is basically in-line with what we\u2019ve expected. If you went back and looked at Medtronic previously and remember this is all now on cash earning and so it\u2019s actually a lower rate that you put in the amortization impact. So it -- you got to make sure you're looking at apples-to-apples when you look at this, Kristen.","But, overall, I mean, Medtronic previously was kind of in -- we\u2019ve been in that kind of 18% to 20% range, Covidien had been kind of in that 16% to 17% range. And then as we basically pull this all together, you leverage those and as we indicated is we\u2019re going to get about 200 basis point drop as we come forward related to that. So as a result, we end up on that 16% to 18% range, I mean, is it 15.5% to 17.5%, I mean, that\u2019s kind of how we get to the overall number.","So it\u2019s in line with what we've expected and been guiding towards overall. Obviously, there is still lot of moving parts with respect to the tax planning and strategies as we go forward, but we think that range is right in line with kind of what we saw here in Q4 as we went forward. It\u2019s all depends on R&D tax credit, getting renewed, all those types of things.","So as we go forward, we feel confident that that\u2019s we are kind of in that range than we\u2019ll have to see where that ultimately ends up, but that\u2019s kind of our current expectation. It is in line with what we\u2019ve been saying previously.","Kristen Stewart","What\u2019s the impact on the R&D tax renewal for that number and what is the updated timeline or resolution on the transfer pricing issue?","Gary Ellis","Well, the R&D tax credit, probably, has an impact of 50 basis points or so to the overall rate as far as where that is. So it\u2019s not huge but it does have an impact on it. And it all depends obviously when they comes in and how much -- how it plays out as far as how much catch up you have when it occurs.","On the transfer pricing issue at Puerto Rico, the cohort is the case. We\u2019re waiting for the judge\u2019s decision on that and that will be whenever the judge decides. I mean, it\u2019s probably going to be towards -- closer towards end of FY or a fiscal year before we hear anything on that, but it\u2019s all based on their timing.","Omar Ishrak","As the judges said they want at least the year to review it.","Gary Ellis","So it\u2019s all based on the timing.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Thanks very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Kristen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just two quick questions. First for Bryan, surgical solutions business continues to remain above market growth, even though you\u2019re getting a much more concerted effort from your chief competitor? So you keep might getting these questions of sustainability in that business despite in a very consistent performance. So, I guess, you could focus on what's driving that success and what gives you the confidence and above market growth going forward and then I have a quick follow-up.","Bryan Hanson","Yeah. I appreciate the question. Yeah. I feel pretty confident, you have got a first kind of reconcile though the fourth quarter, it was very strong for surgical solutions, but we did have some portfolio moves in that. If you pull that out, we\u2019re more in the 7% growth range organically, which is still very strong versus market? And we have noticed a little extra effort by our chief competitor, but we have a lot of confidence in our plan as well.","So I feel that we can continue with that above market growth. We\u2019ve got strong momentum as you\u2019ve already referenced. We have what I believe to be very differentiated technologies both in advance stapling, as well as advanced energy and we continue to launch products in both of those areas.","Matter of fact if I look across the surgical business, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 products that we\u2019re going to launch in FY16 and that will drive somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 million to $70 million of revenue, just in those products launched in FY16.","So the momentum is there. We\u2019re not getting extra days on our approach there, just because we've been winning we\u2019re very intense in launching products that matter and executing policy when we do.","David Lewis","Okay. And then, Omar, I guess, for you. You\u2019ve been very focused on in this three-prong strategy. And I guess, as I think about certain business lines within patient monitoring and recovery, they seem little less strategic or perhaps not fitting with every piece of your strategy? Do you see these businesses as it kind of important to Medtronic strategy and can you comment on sort of the likelihood of targeted divestitures now that you\u2019ve got the deal at least to close?","Omar Ishrak","Look, the way we look at these businesses is, first, are they in line with our mission or not. And second, if they are and in this situation the way we define that is that these businesses collectively impact patient outcomes through elevating pain restoring health to extending life.","Second thing we look at is there room to improve that further, is there technology capability there that can help us drive the outcomes and better outcomes in a more meaningful way, then we look at, is the market space is attractive, can we grow it and is our key capable of delivering. And then finally, we look at that in combination with everything else that we have from a broad value-based healthcare perspective.","So within that we led this thing play out, I mean, this is we just beginning to put this new structure together with that kind of thinking in the business groups and then overtime we\u2019ll evaluate what fits and we are constantly looking at our overall portfolio and we do divestitures of certain items that we feel does not fit into that overall strategy.","So we\u2019ll look at these businesses just like any other business in that context. But certainly, the main question are they in line with our mission or not, can they make a difference for technology, we think, yes.","Gary Ellis","Thanks, David.","David Lewis","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks. Can you hear me, okay? Good morning.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, Bob.","Gary Ellis","Good morning.","Bob Hopkins","So, first question for, Gary, just on 2016 guidance as it relates to free cash flow? Can you give us a sense as to what you expect for 2016 global free cash flow? And then maybe also an update on the percentage of that free cash flow that you think you\u2019ll have access to? I think from some of your slides recently suggested between $7 billion and $7.5 billion of free cash flow in \u201916, but just wanted to confirm that?","Gary Ellis","No, I mean, I think the free cash flow, if you just take and even use our fourth quarter free cash flow here of a $1.7 billion and kind of talk, is that is going to annualize that. Your time more in that $6.8 billion to $7 billion range is kind of what we\u2019ve been talking about overall. Now the reality is however foreign exchange has a big impact in that free cash flow also.","And so just like the kind of our annual rate overall that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019d be at and you\u2019d have as back to Omar\u2019s point earlier, you have some synergies coming into play, the cost of value capture synergies are benefited. But FX is going to be a headwind on cash flow also. So my guess is right now our numbers are probably clearly was based on FX rates, are clearly below $7 billion, probably closer to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion with all the moving parts are going on just because the foreign exchange.","And as we indicated, we do think right now that based on those rates, we\u2019re probably going to be closer to somewhere around 60% of that cash is accessible in the FY16 timeframe would be our current assumption based on the numbers that we see rolling in. And that\u2019s why our 50% commitment to return cash to shareholders, obviously we have much more flexibility around that with that 60% kind of mix that we\u2019re expecting at this point.","The other thing that\u2019s one on Bob, that\u2019s all based in kind of what I\u2019d call on operating basis, including the FX piece. There obviously are still some one-time items that do affect cash flow and that free cash flow I just talked about is really coming from our operating results and that\u2019s where we based all of our assumptions on. But I do have to think about the fact that there are going to be -- so there will be some additional restructuring and things like that and capital investments we\u2019re going to have to make as we go forward with Covidien acquisition.","So that\u2019s all taken into account as we kind of think through our overall free cash flow here for the current year. But in general, I would use right now -- I think it\u2019s less than $7 billion that we\u2019ve previously kind of been talking about. You\u2019re probably down more in the $6.5 billion to $7 billion just based on what\u2019s going on with foreign exchange.","Bob Hopkins","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then one also for Omar, now that you\u2019ve had Covidien for obviously just a few months, but we\u2019d love to hear your updated thoughts on where that you think you can leverage that acquisition beyond just the cost synergies. And I'm thinking specifically about M&A and leveraging your access to your global cash flow and leveraging your low tax rate. And so just wanted to kind of get an update on where that you think you can really leverages as Covidien transaction and the degree to which that helps you with an M&A strategy going forward?","Omar Ishrak","Well, the first thing is that beyond the cost synergies, I just want to remind you that there are two very specific areas that we\u2019ve called out, in drug coated balloon and in neurovascular where we\u2019re getting immediate benefit and we expect some growth acceleration as a result of that. Beyond that, we've begun to explore at a pretty much grassroots levels of engineers, sort of other opportunities where we can leverage each other's technologies.","Now from an M&A perspective, which is using that access to that extra -- using extra access we have to that cash, we stated that we\u2019re going to look at early technologies in the U.S. primarily where there maybe opportunities which we haven't been able to participate into the degree that we\u2019d like to, to create a long-term technology pipeline of early stage technologies that we think can make a difference.","We\u2019ve begun to look at it. We\u2019ve actually already -- in the interior for example, we\u2019re already kind of executed on some of these and we\u2019ve got a good pipeline of other activities that we\u2019re looking at closely. But beyond that, the Covidien or the MITG business has had a history of doing acquisitions to supplement their business with regularity and we\u2019ll certainly continue to encourage that process and in fact focus it even more according to the way in which we\u2019ve organized overall business.","So the M&A activity from us, certainly from a technology perspective is very sort of close to what we\u2019re focusing on. Bigger deals, obviously opportunistically, we\u2019ll look at it, but that\u2019s a matter of our overall financial bandwidth and our management bandwidth. So that\u2019s the way in which we\u2019re approaching this.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor of Barclays.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask one about your emerging markets strategy. You talked a little bit about some partnerships there that you\u2019re pursuing and some things you\u2019re doing to try to get the current rate higher. I guess so I was just curious to see whether you changed your views on what that growth could be sustainably and whether or not Covidien integrated into Medtronic structure could help you to grow faster in EM?","Omar Ishrak","Well, number of points. First of all, our confidence and our belief and really share it if you like, in the long-term opportunity in emerging markets is completely unchanged and we\u2019re not tolerating on that. That\u2019s just matter of fact. The way in which we approach that market to tap into that opportunity, particularly in the short-term, actually it\u2019s been more complex and more difficult than we first envisaged. And so the growth rate has been slower than what certainly we had originally thought.","I think having said that there is certainly, fairly respectable double-digit growth that we can expect reliably, but we want that to be higher. And we\u2019re looking at methods which we continually actually looking at methods which we can do that sooner rather than later. And as we\u2019re learning, channel optimization is a key factor, partnerships with government is a key factor. And finally, referral chain development is something that we need to approach with far greater scale than we\u2019re had before. These are all important factors.","As far as Covidien goes, there are number of things that make us optimistic that this combination will help us. One, there is a complementary strength in certain markets. In the Middle East and Latin America, where between Covidien and Medtronic, we were complementary strength. As a result, we now have our emerging market profile diversify between China, Middle East, and Africa, and Latin America as a big three kind of centers within the emerging markets while previously on a standalone Medtronic basis it was dramatic China. So that gives us a little bit diversity in this markets that we didn\u2019t have.","And finally as we\u2019ve talked about before, simply the scale that we now will allow us to penetrate more geographies much more efficiently than we could before and just adding more sales team around the world either in underpenetrated regions within countries or in brand new countries will have to contribute. So we haven\u2019t pieced all of that stuff together yet, then we are in the process of prioritizing some of those investments. And again, we are trying to accelerate the growth profile in emerging markets with actually pretty great sense of urgency.","Matt Taylor","Thanks for that. And I guess on your synergies you talked about at least 850 million, again in the past you referenced some opportunities to further that number through some network consolidation in your plans. When you think you will be in a position to give us quantifiable update on what you think the synergies could be between the two companies in combination?","Omar Ishrak","I think number of things. First of all, as we go forward, this is going to reflect in our overall productivity. I think that\u2019s the best way to do it, although we will keep track of our value capture efforts with very detailed and granular programs. I think at some point new efforts that are results of the combination versus efforts that were already in place that get accelerated gets very kind of mixed up. And since we\u2019re trying to divide those things up, we\u2019re going to sort of commit to certain levels of productivity that we get out of different line items in our P&L. And that\u2019s the way to do it.","We feel good about a long-term productivity that we can get out of this that the value capture, the synergy sort of effort is going to eventually morph into a long-term productivity benefit, extending way beyond the three years that we projected. I think that\u2019s the correct way to look at it, that this becomes a productivity engine of significant magnitude that we didn\u2019t have before and to some extent, we are pretty excited about.","Jeff Warren","Thanks. We\u2019ve got past the top of hour but we will take two last questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter. Hey Gary, one clarification. It\u2019s still not clear to me, is the R&D tax credit assumed in the guidance or not assumed?","Gary Ellis","On the tax rate, it\u2019s assumed in the guidance, Larry. But what we are saying is that it\u2019s probably towards the higher end of the range until the credit has approved but assuming it gets approved and that we could be in that range.","Larry Biegelsen","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Gary Ellis","It\u2019s basically assumed in there, yes.","Larry Biegelsen","All right. And then for my real questions. First to Gary, the guidance, just bear with me on some numbers here. The guidance implies constant currency EPS growth of about 5.6% to 10% and your sales guidance is about 5% to 7.5%, if you include the extra week. So therefore, the EPS guidance at the low end of the range doesn\u2019t imply any leverage.","Another way of looking at is the EPS guidance is implying the 4% to 6% underlying sales growth, adding the benefit of the extra week and then adding the 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage, that gets you to 7% and 11.5% constant currency EPS growth. And as I said you are guiding constant currency EPS growth of 5.6% to 10%. So, sorry for the long-winded questions, but just curious to know why the EPS guidance appears conservative and I just have one product question? Thanks.","Gary Ellis","Well. I can\u2019t go through all the number you just laid out, Larry, because I don\u2019t have those in my mind. Let me look at it from the way. You are right. Our revenue growth overall as we indicated is expected to grow, plus the 1% to 1.5% related to the extra week. So just taking the midpoint of the range of 5%, you are seeing somewhere around 6%, 6.5% revenue growth.","What do we indicated on the comments overall? From the operating margin perspective as we looked at it, we know from the standpoint of what we are driving there as far as the 100 basis point of improvement on the operating margin as we go forward, we are driving about 400 basis points of leverage and the operating income line on a operational basis before foreign exchange.","And so the point is yes. We are getting that 400 basis points of leverage that we talked about in the calculation. That\u2019s offset, that\u2019s measurably impacted by foreign exchange and so it\u2019s all going to get back. The foreign exchange is offsetting the majority of the overall operating leverage that we\u2019ve talked about and that we are trying to drive towards. So the rest of numbers get a little bit more difficult as we think about the number of shares that had been issued and in the various tax rates are going on between various years as we go forward.","But the guidance is kind of in line with what we were expecting from the overall standpoint of earnings per share growing. Again, as we talked about that 200 to 400 basis points faster than the revenue but unfortunately with $0.40 to $0.50 of FX hit, you take the 430 to 440 and add $0.40 to $0.50 to that, I think you are going to get to the point that it is on a constant currency basis is significant leverage over and above the revenue growth.","Larry Biegelsen","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the Reveal LINQ for Mike, it\u2019s annualizing now at about $500 million. It seems like Q4 was very strong with over 20% sequential growth on. So where are you in the adoption of that product and how should we think about the growth maybe in the near-term and perhaps the next three to five years? And do you see any headwinds from either new competition or reimbursement pressure? Thanks for taking the questions.","Mike Coyle","So on LINQ overall, you have to think about it in terms of its three indications for use of syncope, cryptogenic stroke and atrial fibrillation. On the syncope side, we are probably in the low to mid 20s, penetrated 0.22%. Again, I\u2019m just talking about the U.S. and Europe because that really is the place, currently where it is generating the very significant revenues and we\u2019re still building up reimbursement in other places around the world.","In cryptogenic stroke, it's more like 5% penetrated. And then when you look at atrial fibrillation, it\u2019s more like 1% to 2% penetrated. So there's still plenty of growth opportunity left obviously in the product. Now, we don\u2019t expect competitors who are looking, who have basic capabilities in electronics, are going to looking at this and ignore it. So, we expect that at some point, we are going to see competitors but frankly, we haven't seen anything yet.","I think we're now at a point, as we look at our five-year plans where we think this will be a billion dollar contributor to the overall product company in terms of just its diagnostic sales. And as Omar pointed out, when you look at the syncope patients, you put one of these devices and roughly 8% to 9% of those patients will end up with the pacemaker within a year and by the time you get out to year three, it's more like 20%.","So it is really the source of the Low Power growth that we have seen in the United States in terms of growth in units. So, we think it is an important product line in terms of what it does for us on product sales but it also provide us now with service revenue opportunity longer term to monitor patients. And so we will be updating that as our plans develop.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you.","Jeff Warren","Thanks, Larry. And now time for one last question.","Operator","Our final question will comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse.","Matt Keeler","Hey, guys. This is Matt in for Bruce. Thanks for taking the questions. First for Mike, just in your press release you highlighted to have a growth of 50% worldwide, 30% in the U.S., which implies pretty significant growth, ex-U.S. 60% year-over-year, I think a $30 million step-up according to our math. So are numbers reasonably correct and can you give us any color, kind of on what drove the gains there. Was there any stock, destocking ahead of, or with the launch of the new sizes or anything else there?","Mike Coyle","Just to be clear, the 30% number is the heart valve therapies numbers. So it\u2019s a combination of our transcatheter valves and surgical valves. So actually the TAVI growth in the United States is faster than the international growth.","Matt Keeler","Okay. That makes sense. Can you give us any color on kind of how those split out?","Mike Coyle","So, our growth in overall was about 50% in the U.S. We almost doubled our revenues in TAVI during the quarter on a year-over-year basis. So, U.S. is considerably faster in terms of its overall growth.","Matt Keeler","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow-up on the [indiscernible] spacer launch you talked about this summer. Can you talk about when you will have reimbursement in place? It\u2019s sort of when you expect that product to be fully launched and do you see that more of a source of unit share gains, or is the opportunity therefore a more premium pricing?","Mike Coyle","So, I just didn\u2019t want to finish up with the -- we don't do any meaningful stocking of transcatheter out in the U.S. just to finish your first question. On the trans continuous pacing product line, obviously, we are talking about O-U.S. now and Europe with the CE Mark that we now have. And there is no separate reimbursement in the sense of this product line obtaining different reimbursement in Europe.","So it basically is being targeted at a specific set of patients who might be at risk for infection and single chamber of patient population. Although, you do see opportunities this year, a makeshift towards more single chamber pacing because of the benefit this product line offers in terms of a lower expected complication rates.","So, we think it\u2019s an important breakthrough but you will see us to be deliberate in the rollout of this product. It requires very different implant technique than what the standard pacemaker has and so you will see us doing very significant training and education as we roll this out and that will gage some of the speed with which its grows.","Matt Keeler","Okay. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thanks everyone and thanks to all of you for those great questions. And with that on behalf of our entire management team, thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q1 call, which we anticipate, holding on September 3rd. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Warren, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.Jeff Warren","Thank you, Brandy. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2013 third quarter which ended January 25, 2013. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2012 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported third quarter revenue of $4.27 billion, which represented growth of 4%. Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $946 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.93 increased 7% and 11% respectively.Despite facing many challenges, Q3 represented another step in building toward our goal of delivering consistent growth on both revenue and earnings per share in line with our baseline expectations. With the number of businesses and geographies that delivered strong performances, but at the same time, we faced some unexpected pressures in certain areas. We are still in the process of strengthening and geographically diversifying our business, so that we can continue to deliver a balanced and consistent performance reliably.In the quarter, we continued to see sequential stabilization in two of our key markets U.S. ICD and U.S. Core Spine. When these businesses decline the combined 2% versus the prior year average daily sales grew 4% sequentially as we have fewer selling days in Q3.In addition our daily revenue share increased sequentially in both of these markets despite facing competitive year ends. Gary will walk you through the details later but the trends confirm that these markets are indeed stabilizing. At the same time we continue to manage challenges in other businesses. First U.S. pacing declined 8% versus the prior year and daily sales declined 2% sequentially. Our procedural volumes were ultimately stable through December but decelerated in January. However, our Q3 performance was in line with the market and we do expect further improvements with the launch of advisor MRI which recently received FDA approval. Also our international pacing business covered for the weakness in the U.S. growing 5% in taking over 300 basis points of share year-over-year.Next our B&C business continues to face pressure and decline 21% year-over-year and 14% sequentially. Diabetes historically a high growth business also faced similar pressure in the U.S. as we wait through to achieve FDA approval for our MiniMed 530G. We expect diabetes to quickly return to faster growth once our new products are approved. Our other high growth platforms continued to perform well in Q3. In the cardiac and vascular group our AF and Endovascular businesses delivered double digit growth while our transcatheter valve business for the upper single digit growth and the rest of the therapies group or GBS, Gastro\/Uro, CGM, neurosurgery and advance energy businesses all delivered double digit growth while ENT (inaudible) grew in the high and mid-single digits respectively.Combined this broad base of growth platforms including insulin implants represented over 35% of our revenue and delivered 9% growth in Q3. Recent product approvals and upcoming launches will also contribute to sustained future growth. In TVG we recently received CE Mark for our family of ICD and as the approval of our advisory MRI pacemaker.Looking ahead we\u2019re expecting to see mark approval for our endangered CoreValve Evolut Valve this spring and are targeting the U.S. launch of our Viva CRT-D and Evera ICD product this summer. We\u2019re also expecting approval for Endurant AAA Stent Graft in Japan this summer and the Restorative Therapies Group we recently received CE MARK approval for the first spinal cord stimulation systems that have an indication for full body MRI scans.As I mentioned we\u2019re waiting for approval of our MiniMed 530G which includes a new insulin pump, CGM sensor and (inaudible) algorithm. Looking beyond that 540 rig, our U.S. trials for the CoreValve transcatheter valve and the simplicity renal denervation system and is targeting 550 approvals for these two important growth drivers. Turning to international, our revenue grew 7% with strong growth in Japan in emerging markets offsetting declines in Western Europe. While we have been monitoring Western Europe closely over the past year Q3 was the first quarter where we experienced a meaningful slowdown, declining 1%. Western Europe sales were tracking to the first two months of the quarter but our daily sales slowed in January. Like we have mentioned the softness that we have been experiencing in prior quarters was in Southern Europe especially in Italy.Towards the end of Q3 we saw more generalized softness in several markets including Germany, we\u2019re engaged with our Western Europe team to capitalize the market and our growth but we do believe that it's prudent to be cautious in our expectations as we manage these challenges going forward. Japan has another strong quarter with growth of 18%, more than the covering the unfavorable impact of our zone pricing that went into effect last April.Several of our new innovative products are generating significant position interest. In CRDM we gained over 8 points of pacemaker shares sequentially on the successfully launch of advisor MRI. In coronary the Resolute Drug-Eluting Stent gained four points of the U.S. share sequentially.We also are seeing great customer acceptance for our Endurant AAA Stent Graft and RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator in Japan. In emerging markets our Q3 growth was 21%, Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China, the Middle-East and Africa and India all grew at or above 20%. Latin America\u2019s growth was somewhat slower in Q3 as we continued to work through product registration issues in certain businesses.Revenue growth improved in China this quarter although it was somewhat aided by the easier comparisons due to the timing of the Chinese New Year. In addition to our focus in expanding our existing businesses in the Chinese multinational segment, we have made two strategic moves this year to expand our presence in the Chinese local segment. We closed on our acquisition of China Kanghui Holdings, our entry into the global trauma, spine, and ortho value segment and Kanghui\u2019s performance is meeting our expectations. We also recently completed our investment in LifeTech Scientific and our teams are already working together to enter the structure of our value segment.Emerging market growth, meaningful product launches are high growth platforms and market stabilization are all key factors to building a dependable business that can deliver consistent mid single-digit revenue growth. To achieve this, growth from these areas have to successfully offset different areas of pressure, which for this quarter where Europe, BMP, insulin pumps in US basin. As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to strengthen our business in order to consistently deliver on our mid single-digit revenue growth expectations.In addition to our focus in the top line, we are also executing on both our product and SG&A cost reduction initiatives, which together with financial leverage from our share buybacks will help us grow earnings per share 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue. We are working on reducing product cost by $1.2 billion over the next five years, which is important not only to maintain our gross margins, but also fuels the development of tiered products, which are essential to creating a new value segment opportunities.We are also making progress in our plans to increase our U.S. cash flow through working capital improvements and has set an early goal of improving our inventory turns by 50% over the next five years. Not only this is still good fiscal discipline, but it will strengthen our already robust levels of free cash flow generation. Over the next five years, we expect to generate $25 billion of free cash flow and remain committed to returning 50% of this to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.We believe this level of commitment is appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. The remaining 50% gives us ample flexibility to make investments for sustainable growth and we are and will continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy this capital with a particular focus on returns. We are expecting the M&A transaction to surpass our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate, and we do not intend to pass along EPS dilution to our shareholders. In addition to building credibility and a track record of delivering on our baseline expectations, we are also executing on transformational opportunities that we believe will establish durability in our long-term performance and create potential upside for our baseline. Our first long-term transformational opportunity is accelerating globalization.As I have mentioned before, we believe there is significant opportunity to deepen the penetration of our existing therapies in emerging markets. It is striking to recognize that only 8% of the population in emerging markets that can benefit from and have the financial needs to afford our therapies are indeed receiving them, increasing this penetration level to that of developed markets represents a $5 billion annual opportunity with margins comparable to developed markets. To realize this opportunity, we are focusing on breaking on barriers such as major deficiencies in the areas of awareness, infrastructure, and trading. The Middle East is one example of an emerging market that has a strong desire to improve its healthcare system. I was in Dubai last month attending the largest healthcare congress in the region and (indiscernible) very impressed and encouraged by our plans to realize the potential and generate significant growth in this region over the coming years.As we develop the premium segment in emerging markets, we are also creating the necessary infrastructure to participate in the next wave of growth, the emerging market value segment. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking early steps to be a global leader in this segment with our acquisition of Kanghui and partnership with LifeTech. We believe that building a platform of multi-tiered products will allow our businesses to sustain 20% growth in emerging markets over the long-term.Our other transformational opportunity beyond globalization is our ability to deliver economic value to our customers supported by our market leading technologies. Healthcare payment models are becoming more complex with new paper value models becoming more important. In addition our customers are evolving and now include hospital system, suite executives, payers and governments. Within this changing environment we\u2019re transforming our business to not only deliver clinical value but also deliver economic value. This transformation will include not only our existing products but also developing and piloting new economy value programs. We\u2019re in the early stages of this transformation, Medtronic has specific competitive advantages to win in the new value oriented environment. First our market leading products has remained a critical factor to maintaining strong position at advocacy in the hospital. Second, Medtronic is some of the world\u2019s leading experts in the area of healthcare economics and reimbursement. With the poor skillset economic value and third Medtronic breadth and scale gives us the presence to be a desired partner to larger payers and providers.It is important to note that Medtronic is the only medical technology company positioned with all three of these advantages in our markets which will significantly differentiate us in the new healthcare environment. Let me now ask Gary to take you into a more detail look at our results before we take your questions. Gary?Gary Ellis","Thanks Omar. Third quarter revenue of $4.27 billion increased 3% as recorded and 4% no a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $41 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q3 revenue results by region were as follows, relative Central and Eastern Europe was 24%, the Middle Eastern Africa grew 23%, growth in Greater China was 22%, South Asia 20%, growth in Asia Pacific was 15% including 18% growth in Japan, Latin America grew 14%.Growth in the U.S. was 1% while Western Europe and Canada declined 1%. Emerging markets grew a combined 21% in Q3 and represented 12% of our total sales mix, while this is an improvement it was aided by easier comparison through the timing of the Chinese New Year which conversely will turn into a difficult comparison in Q4.Accordingly we would expect emerging market growth to be in the mid-teens. Q3 earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $946.93 million and an increase of 7% and 11% respectively. Q3 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were 988.97 million an increase of 6% and 10% respectively.Included in our Q3 GAAP earnings was a $70 million gain primarily related to the change in fair value of our RDM contingent commercial milestone payments which are based on annual revenue growth through FY \u201915.Given the current slower commercial ramp in Europe and contracted U.S. regulatory process we now expect our milestone payments to be reduced that some of our value our RDM business has now shifted beyond the final milestone date. In our cardiac and vascular group revenue of 2.100 billion grew 5%. Results were driven by solid growth in the coronary, endovascular, structural heart and AF Solutions, partially offset by declines in ICDs. CRDM revenue of 1.171 billion declined to 1%, worldwide ICD revenue of $654 million declined 2% which was slightly better than the overall market as our shock reduction and lead integrity alert technologies combined with our proven long term lead performance continued to receive strong market acceptance. In the U.S. our ICD revenue was stable sequentially after adjusting for fewer selling days.Our lead default ratio remained strong and it is at its highest point in several years. In addition our ICD implant volumes grew 5% the fourth quarter in a row of implant growth. At the same time our U.S. ICD pricing declined 5%, while hospitals continued to reduced their bulk purchases on a year-over-year basis they were sequentially stable during this quarter.Taken together these trends suggest that our U.S. ICD business is stabilizing, at the same time we\u2019re monitoring the European ICD market very closely as it is declining mid-single digits driven by deteriorating pricing in some key markets. Despite the declines we\u2019re gaining share and have a number of new high powered products coming to market. Including the Evera ICD with increased longevity and the most advance shock reduction technology available. The Viva CRT-D with adaptive CRT for significantly better response rate, we are paying for former second generation quadripolar lead and our unique CardioGuide Real-Time Navigation Systems to improve CRT implant procedures.Pacing revenue of $459 million was flat, outperforming the global market by over 200 basis points as we gained global pacing share on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. Our U.S. Pacing revenue declined 8% in line with the market. These declines were driven primarily by pricing, which was down in the mid-single digits, and to a lesser extent, declines in implant volumes. In Japan, our low power business grew over 20% as our Advisa MRI pacemaker being 8 points of share sequentially, including the double-digit increase in new implants.Coronary revenue of $445 million grew 19%. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $274 million, including $97 million in the U.S. and $30 million in Japan. Resolute Integrity\u2019s deliverability, unique FDA labeling for diabetes, and long-term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally. This is reflected in our DES share, where we gained another point of share sequentially in the U.S. and nearly 4 points per share sequentially in Japan. This quarter\u2019s performance has now propelled us to the number one global market position in combined DES bare-metal stent share.In renal denervation, while Q3 commercial results continued to be soft, the long-term outlook for this opportunity in hypertension remains robust, and we are investing in evidence generation and technology development to further strengthen our leadership position. Revenue was still lagging behind our original expectations due primarily to the lack of broad reimbursement and limited funding for new technology in nearly every European market. Many referring physicians and payers are waiting for larger datasets and longer term follow-up, including data from our HT and free U.S. civil study, which we expect to have fully enrolled by summer.We are still tracking for an FY \u201815 U.S. approval albeit later in the fiscal year. At the same time, we continue to advance our leading renal denervation technology pipeline and expect to receive CE Mark for our (simplicity spiral) multi-electrode catheter this summer. This product will take ablation time down from 16 to 24 minutes today to only 2 minutes and (offer you) a very small 6-French catheter. We believe our technology, strong clinical data, and significant intellectual property represents a large multi-billion dollar opportunity in renal denervation.In Structural Heart, revenue of $272 million increased 4%, including 6% growth in transcatheter valves. We estimate the international transcatheter valve market grew 6% to 8% in Q3. Our CoreValve device continues to have leading share in our addressable market, where we expected CE market approval of our Engager value this spring, we expect to expand into the transapical segment, which represents approximately 20% of the international TAVI in market. Positive data from our Engager at CE\u2019s pivotal trials demonstrating high procedural success and exceptional rates of PBL at six months were presented at FCS in January. Also on the clinical front, we are actively enrolling patients in our global SYNTAVI trial, which is designed to expand the market for CoreValve into more moderate risk patients. In our CoreValve U.S. pivotal study, enrollment in our extreme and high-risk arms is complete, and we remain on track to commercialize in the U.S. in FY \u201815.In the endovascular, revenue of $212 grew 14% with strong balanced growth across our aortic and peripheral businesses. In aortic, our AAA business grew in the double-digits driven by strong growth from Endurant in Japan and a continued acceptance of Endurant II in other global markets. Our thoracic business grew over 25% on the strength of Valiant Captivia in U.S. and China. In peripheral, we had double-digit growth in our peripheral stent business. Our drug-eluting balloon business also had double-digit growth in Q3 and we recently completed enrollment in our U.S. pivotal study trial for our impact drug-eluting balloon with an SFA indication.Now, turning to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue of $1.927 billion grew 3%. Results are driven by growth in surgical technologies, neuromodulation and diabetes partially offset by clients in BMP and (inaudible). Spine revenue of $753 million declined 3% globally and 6% in the U.S. primarily driven by declines in BMP and BKP. We completed our family acquisition in Q3 and as expected there was no overall impact in spine organic growth in Q3 as we started to wind down our Weigao joint venture while only recognizing two months of overall revenue. Core spine revenue of $639 million was quite globally and declined 1% in the U.S. Excluding BKP our Core spine business grew 2% globally and grew 1% in the U.S which was a point higher than the U.S. market as we gained share on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Our U.S. core business continues to stabilize as new products and procedures are rolling out and performing well. And Thoracic Lumbar our Solera system is generating strong surgeon interest.In cervical we\u2019re beginning to seeing growth in U.S. disc a we ramp up surgeon training of our recently launched BRYAN ACD. And Interbody our new AMT portfolio and caps down control our product use and our (inaudible) procedure are driving growth. Another biologics, Grafton and MagniFuse DVMs continue to perform well. We\u2019re also differencing our aspiring business from the competition to enabling technologies such as O-arm Imaging, StealthStation Navigation and powered surgical instruments. Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine surgery. As they see clear value from better outcomes and more efficient procedures. This is also resulting in significant pull through for navigation in powered and enabled spinal implants. In fact in accounts have o-arm we\u2019re seeing core spine revenues grow 10 points higher than non o-arm accounts this fiscal year.We believe we\u2019re still only on the leading edge of this large differentiated community in spine. In BMP revenue of over $114 million declined 21% as this business continues to face market uncertainty. The Yale University is overseeing the finalization of publication of the findings from independent reviews of the BMP data. They control the timing and we now understand from them that the systematic reviews are not likely to be published until early FY \u201914.To a lesser extent our Q3 results were also affected by our inability to fulfill hospital quarter in sales orders due to a supply constraint of sterile water which is a component of an infused kit. We received FDA approval for an alternative sterile water supply last week which will allow us to work through our back order kits in Q4. Surgical technologies revenue of 350 million grew 10% driven by double digit growth in neurosurgery and advance energy.Neurosurgery performance was driven by Medtronic powered surgical solutions and core navigation including sales of StealthStation S7 Surgical Navigation systems. In advanced energy, strong double digit growth of our both of our Aquamantys bipolar sealers and PEAK PlasmaBlade electrical surgical products driven results. Turning neuromodulation, revenue of $447 million increased 7%, these results were driven by strong global growth in DVS and Gastro\/URO as well as paced in U.S.In DVS we had another strong quarter of double digit growth as our referral challenge development efforts are generating new implants. Our Gastro\/URO business also grew double digits in Q3 driven by strong adoption of our Intrathecal therapy in Western Europe and the U.S. In stent we\u2019re now launching in Europe, the markets first spinal cord stimulator system that are approved for full body MRI scans including our RestoreSensor of SureScan MRI stimulator and Vectris SureScan MRI lead. Diabetes revenue of $377 million grew 3% driven by double digit growth in CGM. In the U.S. diabetes declined 1% as U.S. consumers continue to wait for FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump and the Enlite sensor which we now hope to occur later this spring or summer. In addition to the impact of the delay we also deferred $9 million in revenue if you plan to convert some of the recently full pumps to the new technology once it is approved. Outside of United States our business grew 11% although insulin pump growth slowed somewhat in Western Europe as we await the launch of our next generation insulin pump the MiniMed 640G this summer.Now, turning to the rest of the income statement, the gross profit margin was 75.2%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, our gross margin was 75.8%. Foreign currency\u2019s negative impact on our gross margin offset the overall efficiencies in product manufacturing, which are results of our ongoing $1.2 billion initiative to reduce product cost over five years. In Q4, we expect gross margins to be approximately 75.5%.Third quarter R&D spending of $376 million was 9.3% of revenue. We remain committed to investing in new technologies to drive future growth, and for Q4, we expect R&D spending to be around 9%. Third quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.401 billion represented 34.8% of sales. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, Q3 SG&A on an operational basis was 34.7%, a 30 basis point improvement from the third quarter last year. We continued to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses, while at the same time, investing in new product launches and adding to our sales force in faster growing businesses and geographies. In FY \u201813, we continued to expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement.Amortization expense for the quarter was $88 million and we expected increase from prior quarters due to the Kanghui acquisition. For Q4, we continue to expect amortization expense to be approximately $90 million. Net other expense for the quarter was $17 million, which was lower than our original forecast due to less than planned U.S. medical device tax, royalty expense, and minority interest in elimination as we wind down our Weigao joint venture. Net gains from our hedging program were $13 million during the quarter. As you know, we had our reporting results to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Based on current exchange rates, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million.Net interest expense for the quarter was $46 million. Excluding the $23 million non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $23 million. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $11.8 billion in cash and cash investments and $11.4 billion in debt. In Q4, we have $2.2 billion of convertible debt that we intend to refinance as Street debt, which will result in higher cash interest rates on this portion of our debt. As a result, based on current interest rates we anticipate non-GAAP net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in Q4 due to the debt overlap and it\u2019s also worth noting that we will no longer have convertible debt outstanding in FY \u201814 and the non-GAAP adjustment will not be accessible. Based on current rates, we would expect net interest expense to be $40 million to $45 million per quarter throughout FY \u201814 a level that is more comparable to our current GAAP net interest expense level.Let\u2019s now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 14.5%. Excluding the impact of certain acquisition-related items and the impact in the non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense, our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q3 was 15.8%. Included in this rate are tax benefits associated with the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. In addition, the finalization of certain income tax returns and audits resulted in a $0.01 benefit from our original tax expectations. For FY \u201813, we expect an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 19.5%.Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated approximately $3.4 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Fiscal year-to-date, we have paid approximately $800 million in dividends and repurchased more than $1.2 billion of our common stock. As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 27 million shares. Third quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.21 billion shares.Let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal year 2013 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We believe at constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for the full fiscal year 2013, although we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchanges rates would remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year that our FY \u201913 revenue will be really affected by approximately $300 million to $320 million including an unfavorable $20 million to $40 million impact in Q4. With respect to earnings per share guidance, we continue to expect the FY \u201913 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.56 to $3.70 which implied annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 7%. While we do not provide quarterly guidance based on our performance through three quarters we would expect to get the upper end of our ranges on both revenue and earnings per share.As in the past my comments and guidance do not including any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year nor do they include the impact of a non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense. I will now turn it back over to Omar who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?Omar Ishrak","Thanks Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A let me conclude by reiterating the Q3 represented another quarter in building towards our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth. While we continue to execute in areas we can control, including growing our markets, we have seen early in the process of building a business that is strong enough to offset the variables that are beyond our control so that we can reliably deliver our client expectations which are consistent mid-single digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue and returning 50% of free cash flow through shareholders. At the same time we\u2019re also playing a leading role in transforming global healthcare by implementing our long term strategies of economic value and globalization.We\u2019re only at the beginning of establishing our track record but we believe that crisp execution on both our baseline and long term growth strategies combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long term dependable value in health care. With that we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A, in addition to Gary I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac Investor Group and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group to join us again for the Q&A session. We\u2019re rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions so we respectfully request to limit yourself to only one question and if necessary one follow-up so that we can get to as many people as possible. If you have any additional questions please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please.Question-and-Answer Session","OperatorOur first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorganJanuary was a little bit soft and just curious how the January performance impacts you\u2019re thinking relative to the goal of getting back to mid-single digit revenue growth in the near term and I know it's premature to think about FY \u201914 but if you have to think about it today how that would influence that goal of getting back to mid-single digits for FY \u201914?Omar IshrakThe goal is still there, obviously the slowdown in January especially in Europe put some challenges in our way but we feel that they are streaming our businesses enough is to get there. YOU know like we mentioned at JPMorgan there are basically a roadmap included you know strengthening of the U.S. ICD and its spine markets kind of offsetting the year-over-year sort of bad comparison if you like with resolute integrity. However on top of that rest of the businesses were supposed to grow, you can call it about 4.5% or 5% and that\u2019s we were sort of road mapping our mid-single digit. Now Europe\u2019s got pressure but it's 10 times Japan has got some upside and we\u2019re like pushing emerging markets quite hard and you know that\u2019s basically the influx to offset these different variables and address the challenges and then reach our goals. We think is fairly achievable.Gary EllisI will add to what Omar said I mean overall we obviously January especially and Europe was softer than we expected and as we look into our comments that gives us a little bit of pause but as Omar said there is a lot of parts of Medtronic and we\u2019re going to have to push harder in some other areas and we don\u2019t know what the impact of Europe is long term either we have to make sure see how that plays out but as Omar said Japan is continue to be very, very strong, the U.S. was trying to see some growth back in some of our core businesses, spine and CRDM. So in that we\u2019re still, our goal is to put the other plants that can deliver on that mid-single digit growth. Now, as you indicated, we are not giving FY \u201814 guidance yet, but that is still our plan to deliver on the mid-single digit revenue growth.Mike Weinstein - JPMorganThanks. And then just one quick follow-up on the diabetes business, it sounded like you got a round of questions on the 530G approval, any sense of the likelihood of that pushes out beyond just a three-month turnaround?Omar IshrakWell, I can\u2019t really say. I mean we are working with the FDA closely and we are pretty optimistic that we will get it in the next few months, but our regulatory process has norms, which we cannot control, but at this stage, we are working closely with them and you achieve and expect to achieve a positive outcome.Mike Weinstein - JPMorganThank you, Omar.Omar Ishrak","Thanks Mike.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.Matthew Dodds - CitigroupHi, good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Mike\u2019s question on diabetes, at the U.S. it was down 1%, I know the pump business are being held up by the new approval, but how is the disposable business tracking and is the diabetes market year-over-year for pumps slowing overall?Omar IshrakWe are such a big piece of the market. I think we obviously have an impact on that. There are some pressures that the other competitors have also faced, but I think the new pump is a strong enough catalyst that it will have further growth in the market and we are big enough there in that space. And as far as the disposable market is concerned, I think that\u2019s fine.Gary EllisYeah, Matt, the disposables overall are growing fine, we are not seeing any CGMR disposables. We are not seeing growth slowdown there as primarily in the pump side of the equation, and we do believe it\u2019s related to the fact that people are waiting for the new pump voice approval. And so that\u2019s clearly having impact. I mean, I think the overall pump market in the U.S., it had been somewhat slower even if you went back over the last year, it had been somewhat slower, but what you have seen outside the United States when you get this new pump approved the 530G with its global (indiscernible) system feature, we have seen that we actually we accelerated the markets and we saw that outside the United States and Europe, where we saw double-digit growth really two years since the pump has been launched. And so we are expecting that, that will accelerate pump growth in the U.S. And as Omar has said, we are such a large part of the market that, that clearly will drive market growth.Matthew Dodds - CitigroupOkay. And a quick one for Mike Coyle, we see Advisa now out can you compare and contrast how much more of the market, what\u2019s the potential share benefit is of Advisa versus Revo?Mike CoyleSo, obviously you have seen Advisa has had a real impact on our growth in Japan, but it is also the first MRI product to be approved in Japan since Revo has been in the marketplace here for a year in the U.S. We don\u2019t expect quite as much benefit as we are seeing in Japan, but on the other hand, adding all of the top end feature sets of our Advisa Pacemaker II and now an MRI capable product gives us an opportunity we think both on price as well as on the market share. And importantly, it also gives us now a Revo as a product tier to deal with some of the pricing pressures we have seen at the mid-tiers. So, we think it\u2019s going to be an important addition to our product line. And now we think it will continue the momentum that we are seeing in pacing. We are up as we pointed out on a global basis two market share points year-over-year and obviously having this to reload our U.S. offering is very encouraging.Matthew Dodds - CitigroupThanks Mike. Thanks Omar. Thanks Gary.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.Bob Hopkins - Bank of AmericaGood morning. Can you hear me okay?Omar IshrakYes, okay Bob.Bob Hopkins - Bank of AmericaGreat, good morning. So, I was just wondering if you could provide some more details on two things which you mentioned on the call. First, you talked about selling day comparisons and I was wondering if you could just be more specific about exactly where the mismatch is, where this particular quarter? And then secondly on Western Europe, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more detail about specifically which areas of the business are seeing the greatest weakness, is it cardiovascular, is it spine, is it pricing, is it even, just a little bit more detail on Western Europe and on the selling day mismatches that you mentioned?Omar IshrakYeah, let me cover Western Europe and I will let Gary cover the selling day thing, and Gary could answer Western Europe. Western Europe, I would answer by saying all of the above, because in general we have had general softness like everywhere it\u2019s I think more in the cardiovascular area, because the products, there is more competition in there, more in the radar screen if you like of the regular, of the policy makers, but you know every business face certain degree of pressure and you know it's both pricing and volume and varies by country, you know Italy for example if it's grow both of them. In Germany it was more pricing. So it varied according to the different countries, but we see this quarter which was different from previous quarters was that in previous quarter\u2019s the softness you like was limited to Southern Europe. This quarter we saw more generalized softening and to some degree you know the general economy (inaudible) is going to consistent with that but again we don\u2019t know all the answer yet, we\u2019re watching this thing very carefully. On this we were doing everything we can to our specialist to make it clear because the market valued our product spring and the value to the healthcare system will in terms of cost and clinical efficacy there are product spring and through that approach we hope to at least stabilize the markets.Gary EllisJust quickly on the selling base, Bob what we\u2019re trying to highlight is really wasn\u2019t a significant difference in selling days this year versus last year there is a difference, our Q3 versus Q2 which we have always have. Q3 is the lowest selling days for us in either quarters just to from a standpoint of obviously the holiday seasons that are in there and so as a result of that Q4 versus Q3 there is five, six extra selling days in our Q4 and with the same thing versus Q2. So last time we were trying to highlight in the comments when we are comparing against that sequential our Q2 results that there was fewer selling days this quarter versus the prior quarter versus the prior year it's basically comparable. It does have some impact you know we probably saw a little bit more impact we believe this year than last you tend to obviously where the holidays fall in the week and what\u2019s that kind of an impact, so there was some of that softness, in fact that was in some way\u2019s what we thought might have been some of the issue even in Europe though that the first two weeks of January clearly were much, much softer than we have historical seen. So we couldn\u2019t tell whether that was really a holiday effect or not so we\u2019re watching it closely but clearly that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to get in the selling days comment. There is no difference really on year-over-year.Matthew Dodds - CitigroupThanks and just one quick follow-up on the BMP, supply constraint, how much did that impact the revenues in the quarter and when do you expect that to be resolved?Omar IshrakWell right now it is resolved, so we\u2019re shipping with the supply constraint, we got approval on the sterile water supply right from the FDA. So that thing is resolved, how much of an impact there it had, it had some impact I mean Chris you want to make a comment on that if you want?Chris O'Connell,Sure yeah Bob, it wasn\u2019t major impact, we were on allocation on certain tip sizes because of the sterile water supply issue and we didn\u2019t take typical end of the quarter orders and so now that we have FDA approval on our new supplier for sterile water we\u2019re in the process of releasing inventory and getting back into, getting off an allocation basis on that product and so I would characterize it as a minor.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.David Lewis - Morgan StanleyYou gave us a more detail on acquisition strategy that they have end in entire quarter, so I\u2019m going to start there and maybe one follow-up, if you give us some more color in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the size of transaction sort of become comfortable with Medtronic as several years doing deals that were less than a $1 billion, maybe you can talk us how the size of transaction maybe the stage development. It sounds like your preference is still emerging market or developed markets but then emerging markets you did talk about the nice return goals, help us understand sort of how you think about this return goals as it relates to transactions like (inaudible) which are very much infrastructure type of deals but any additional color you can give us on some of those components it will be very helpful.Omar IshrakI think David the goals and the hurdles is going to change, you know based on whether it's geographic broadening acquisition or new technology acquisition I mean those goals are going to change. You know we really look at two things or three things if you like, we look for a strategic fit, strategic fit you know we have already described our businesses in three groups, the cardiovascular group, the vascular group which essentially includes Ortho and Spine in a broad sense and URO for that matter Ortho Spine and URO and diabetes and we\u2019re aiming to fill gaps within these groups that\u2019s one area of strategic focus and the other is as we fill those jobs, you are also looking at acquisitions that can help us deliver economic value and that could mean broadening our focus in the continuum of care, but always related to our therapy and by that I mean looking at businesses which help us identify patients better or more efficiently as well as patient management offerings. And the other area is globalization, and in globalization, it\u2019s primarily at this stage anyway is approaching the value segments although we are quite interested in sort of market growth as well if we see fit in distribution companies who got high share, who got credibility in certain marketplaces are also areas that we look at. So, those are the areas that we look at. That\u2019s the first thing of strategic focus.The second is it\u2019s going to have certain hurdle rates in the mid-teens and that surprised everyone, no matter who we buy. And the third is that we have got to cover dilution within the company and by covering dilution what I mean is that our goal of delivering this mid single-digit growth with 200 to 400 basis points of leverage and EPS is something we want to protect despite an acquisition. Your acquisition should help us get there rather than get in the way of achieving that. So, these are the things that we try to look at for the acquisition. The size it\u2019s new to all this criteria is a secondary factor.David Lewis - Morgan StanleyOkay, very helpful. And then Gary just a quick follow-up here, if we think about margins and progression throughout the year specifically gross margins, it come down maybe 50, 60 basis points across the quarters, if you sort of \u2013 if we get to the fourth quarter number that you provided is obviously where it comes in at, can you see what the sense of the factors across the quarters whether it\u2019s FX some of the pricing pressure you talked about or geographic mix? So, what\u2019s been sort of the incremental downward pressure on GEMs across the quarters?Gary Ellis","Yeah. Well, as we indicated obviously FX was a big impact, especially over the last couple of quarters. And the good news is as we go into fourth quarter here we are starting to anniversary, especially versus the euro some significant changes on the FX. And so the FX impact started in Q4 is less than the gross margin line and so we do expect that we are not going to quite have quite a negative impact that we have had over the last two or three quarters from that factor.As you indicated, I mean obviously we continued to see pricing pressures across the organization we talked about that. The mix, revenue mix, we got positives and negatives Japan obviously being the big growth, and then right now it has higher margins and that\u2019s positive. Having what\u2019s actually coming back the CRDM business and even spine in the U.S. which are higher margin businesses improving is good, but we saw pricing pressure that we are offsetting and then we are having product cost reductions obviously as we continue to take the $1.2 billion of product cost out. So, we are seeing a benefit on that side of equation. So, there is a lot of factors that are driving it. Overall, we feel still very confident that we are kind of been \u2013 we have been able to maintain that 75% to 76% range. It\u2019s been varied by 30, 40 basis points in kind of given quarters, but in general, as we indicated for the fourth quarter 75.5% is kind of what we are looking at, and that\u2019s assuming that the FX basically stay to our setup, and we don\u2019t have a significant negative impact from FX, which is what we have been finding in the last two or three quarters.David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.Bruce Nudell - Credit SuisseGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for Omar and then a follow-up for Mike. Oman, at (NYSEARCA:GEM) you were sounding recently optimistic that mid-single digits was feasible with kind of reasonable in short assumptions. Clearly, January in Europe seemed to be a surprise to the company. Now, the question is do you guys have intelligences to whether or not January was just a bad month or there were specific identifiable policy changes that really impacted the quarter?Omar IshrakI don\u2019t think we have really hard evidence, but our \u2013 obviously we have looked into these very closely and are watching the trends very carefully as well. The policy changes there aren\u2019t any dramatics across the board policy changes in Europe that we can point to. However, in Italy, for example, some of the policy changes are people are driving more strongly and is having an impact. I think there is a general concern and this is a little qualitative but there is a general concern over the overall economy and Europe like you have heard recently in the three has been a concern about growth in Germany and I think that to some degree is probably driving some of this caution in the marketplace both from policy makers as well as patients to certainly a degree that they participate in paying for their own healthcare. So that\u2019s the best that I can do about it, I will be welcomed to\u2026Gary EllisI don\u2019t know if I can add much more to what Omar said, obviously we were surprised by January. We have since seen through December we were feeling pretty good and then January 30 was softer, as we indicated through the first couple of weeks we could maybe point to the holidays and say that was maybe just an usual impact and that was both power exploiting it and we thought we could see a recovery a little bit in the back half of January but we\u2019re still cautious because it's not like it's bounced back you know to where we\u2019re previously as far as growth rate and so we\u2019re watching that carefully but we don\u2019t have any, as Omar said there is nothing from a policy or direction that changed in January. There wasn\u2019t anything that you know came up in the government or anything else that would have changed how why January ended up being the way it was and it just seems as the overall, as Omar said the overall economy and concern and focus on healthcare is what\u2019s going to focus on and we will have to wait and see how long this plays out.Bruce Nudell - Credit SuisseOkay and for on TAVI, you know Western Europe is have\u2019s and have\u2019s not and I was wondering if you guys could comment on the just general trajectory of volume and price and what\u2019s it going to take you know to get the rest of Western Europe to look more like Germany where they are moving past partner one through into partner two type patients and then finally like when is the extreme rest data from your trial in the U.S. likely to be made available.Omar IshrakOn the question of Europe in general you know we believe the availability of data into the moderate risk patient population is going to be the key item to expanding the usage of the technology more broadly outside of Germany and obviously we\u2019re very aggressively pursuing enrollment in our TAVI program to provide those data. In addition for us obviously the availability for us to penetrate the transthecal segment is going to be important and then we expect engage or CE Mark here in the spring and going forward that gives us an opportunity to penetrate what\u2019s roughly 20% of the overall market. So those would be the primary drivers, I would point to for what will keep the growth going in the upper single digit kind of range for Europe.In terms of availability for our data, we are in the U.S. trial we would expect that to become available in the fall time frame for sharing more generally and that\u2019s what I would set as an expectation.Bruce Nudell - Credit SuisseI guess just a follow-up on you know like you look at the U.K I mean you know in Belgium I mean they are not through partner one yet, I mean so what\u2019s it going to take to open up markets like that?Omar IshrakI mean again I think there has to be compelling data to show the use of this technology in lower risk patients to really get at the larger patient population and I think that you know we are very aggressively pursuing the generation of those data.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.Raj Denhoy \u2013 JefferiesI wonder if I could ask a bit about the U.S. ICD market, you know I think for a couple of quarters now you commented about the lead to port ration continuing to increase for you but you haven\u2019t yet seen any full through on the CAN side, I\u2019m curious whether you expect to do that or really what\u2019s behind that sort of lack of pull through.Gary EllisAs you point out I mean we have seen it consistency have seen an increase in the lead to port ratios and that is very encouraging for us, I think the opportunity that we see going forward is to use some of the unique technologies that we have within our cans to differentiate our product line and for example we have submitted data for the use of our lead integrity alert with competitive leads which we believe would be an important catalyst for us to be able to convert replacement shares on competitive lead products. So that\u2019s an example of where I think, we have some opportunity to expand CAN penetration but the other piece is we just have the very robust pipeline going forward, I mean as you look at that now the revised MRI program on the pacing side, but also the Evera product line is going to be coming into the U.S. in the first quarter of next year which offers a significant size\/shape productions and longevity enhancements to the overall product line, which we think will help us with the CAN penetration.And then the availability of the Viva\/Brava product which offers some unique algorithms for enhancing CRT effectiveness in that segment of the population, that too will be coming to the U.S. in the first quarter. And obviously, those products, Evera and the Viva\/Brava are also going to help us in Europe, where we now have the Viva\/Brava approved and are getting very nice uptake on that technology in Europe, and that we\u2019ll have Evera here in the fourth quarter. So, we think these are going to give us good opportunities to continue to share or capture momentum. And it was encouraging to us that we are up almost growing a point of share year-over-year on the ICD side even though our competitors have been in new product introduction modes and we are just entering ours. So, we think the share momentum will continue in these segments.Raj Denhoy - Jefferies","Okay. Just two quick follow-ups, so in times past, you have also talked about the replacement market improving for you, how much of that share increase you are seeing is on the replacement side and are you actually starting to see now acceleration in that side of your business?Gary EllisMost of the share capture has been on the replacement side, but we expect that to now shift to the initial implant side as we bring in our new products.Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And then just lastly pricing again U.S. sizing is I think you noted was down 5% in the U.S., how has that been changing, have you seen that stabilized as pricing getting worse, and also in the context of not bulking to see negative 5% is kind of a big number?Gary EllisWell, the negative 5% is slightly well worse than what we had been seeing. Typically, we have been seeing about 3% declines in the prior quarters, but obviously we think the new products are going to give us an opportunity to play in multiple tiers with better pricing which is going to be helpful to us. But frankly, we have also seen more competitive pressure on pricing. And so we are going to continue to shift our discussions with customers to the breadth of our CVG product offering from the standpoint that we have multiple programs for economic value creation and meeting out their patient clinic, meeting outpatient closer there at CAT labs, the blood conservation programs, the use of the connectivity technologies that we have like they are going to express for being able to do more efficient device checks in the emergency rooms. These were all programs that we are working with accounts on multi-product line offerings to basically address their core economic needs beyond simply the price reductions that we are seeing. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s getting a lot more attraction we think will help us with mitigating some of these pricing issues going forward.Raj Denhoy - JefferiesIt\u2019s helpful. Thank you.Omar Ishrak","Next question?OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dave Roman with Goldman Sachs.Dave Roman - Goldman Sachs","Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the question. I was hoping I know there is a lot of focus on this call on trends in January in Europe, but if I look across your U.S. businesses, there is actually it seems to be pretty healthy, can you just talk about the trajectory in some of the core U.S. markets and maybe you could help us frame it into two categories? One will be sort of looking at those businesses that have faced sort of reassessment on prescribing patterns whether that\u2019s spine or ICDs, whether we are in fact you think reaching a bottom there, employees for reacceleration, and then maybe some of the categories that are more elective in nature, where you might have seen some seasonal impact in the fourth calendar quarter and how those have trended?Omar IshrakNo, I think you are right. I think there is room for reason for some level of optimism regarding the U.S. market, because in general that\u2019s at least being stable over the past few quarters. I think a number of things. First of all, I do think in January and in early part of the year in the U.S., there is some pressure in the market based on people\u2019s insurance plans, deductibles start coming up early in the year, so any out-of-pocket expense, be even more careful weapon, that has a tendency to shift procedures to the back half of the year when they want to use up whatever health benefits they had. So, there is that kind of factoring in the U.S. market, which we think we do see in the early part of the year as insurance schemes become more and more patient pay dependent. That\u2019s one factor, but on the other hand, we do think that both in spine and in ICDs there is a general stabilization of volume and implants and then spine for example has reached a level of stability that we haven\u2019t seen for years I think with the practitioners getting comfortable with qualities in place. Now we expect to continue to work with them to drive further growth in that market but they seem to be somewhat of stabilization. I think there is going to be issues of pricing, I think there is going to be issues in the U.S. healthcare reform in the Affordable Care Act distant and there is a certain level of uncertainty there. I think there is factors around the accountable care organizations that we have to watch but in all of these areas we think that if we can demonstrate value financially of the products that we that is essential to our success and the success of the whole healthcare system. So we do think that the U.S. in some ways will be a little more stable than Europe for example but again I mean it's uncertainty there as well.Gary EllisYes just to add to Omar\u2019s comment David is you know what I would also say is I think you\u2019re right, I think U.S. is looking better because of the stabilization in ICDs and spine as Omar said I think that we need to know people and need to focus on is as you heard from Mike and even as going through our discussion. We have a lot of new products or just in the U.S. market at this point in time and I mean spine have seen some uplift because they have added new products here recently that are certainly impacted. CRDM is getting ready to launch several new products in the U.S. market, diabetes as we talked about you know is clearly getting ready to launch in the U.S. market and the fact is some of the things that have been driving some of the emerging international markets some of those products are finally just hitting the U.S. market and I think that will even have well especially on top of the fact that we stabilized the ICD and spine business we will help to start accelerating some of the growth in the U.S.Dave Roman - Goldman SachsAs that I have a follow-up just on that last point Gary were you talked about new product launches. If we look at RDN outside of the United States I think your comments have gone a little bit more slowly than you had expected maybe you can provide a little bit more detail there but maybe more broadly speaking as new products get phased in and launched how should we be thinking about ramp curves and timing of adoption. I mean if you look across the entire sector it seems you know we\u2019re all used to you launch a new product that automatically gets adopted those ramp curves are all looking more slowly than the uses, maybe how should we think about your new product flow and then the corresponding impact on revenue and then earnings.Omar IshrakMaybe I will just add a few comments, you know first of all the ramp increasingly people will demand economic data because you know every government everybody in the world is concerned about healthcare cost, even when they are spending as a percent of GDP low they all watch what\u2019s going around the world and are very careful well that\u2019s creating healthcare cost. So the new for economic value of these therapies is going to be and is becoming as important as clinical value so that\u2019s an essential ingredient to accelerating the commercial adoption of some of these products. The other factor which you have to be careful with is that you know in these parts are different, when RDN for example has a referral chain that is to be educated which is not the same as some of the other products that we might launch and so depending on the details of and the nature of the technology and who is adopting it or what are the barriers in changing the physician or the hospital or healthcare system workflow that\u2019s also will affect the speed of ramp. So those are two things that I would look at as we look at new products.OperatorYour final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.Kristen Stewart - Deutsche BankJust wanted to go back over Gary I know you mentioned over expense came in a little bit lower I think you decide the device tax and then also I think a gain on the sale of investment, can you maybe just talk about the drivers that between where it came at 17 relative to your expectations again and whether the device tax is something that we should expect should remain lower whether it's a timing issue.Gary EllisYeah there was a few items that affected the interim company extended the line item, it's a little bit favorable than we had expected. One is something we have should, we didn\u2019t know the timing on it with the solution of the Weigao joint venture, one thing is obvious as a joint venture we consolidated the entire sales and expenses really the joint venture, but the profits related that basically Weigao took the offsetting profits, half the profits in effect were down as an expense in other income and expense line item, with it does revolving the joint venture that went away. So, that expense that we have had down in net other income expense was be eliminations, because of the accounting on how we handle Weigao now joint venture. So, that was a benefit that we didn\u2019t anticipate at the beginning of the quarter. It obviously is also by the fact you don\u2019t have the revenues and everything else that we would have we also lost from the resolution of the joint venture. And Kanghui, obviously, then the revenues and expenses are up all of above the line not in the other kind of interest income and expense line even though those two basically offset. That was one item.The medical device tax was also a little lower than we expected. Now, we only have the one month device tax, but as the final rules and regulations came out, basically what we saw is on \u2013 the basically the existing inventory that\u2019s in the field already you don\u2019t pay the device tax on that piece of it. And so as a result of that only thing we pay is what\u2019s coming for the manufacturer that actually goes through to the spinal sales. So, there is \u2013 there will be a little bit of a slower ramp up on the device tax itself just based on what the existing inventory levels that are out there for the various businesses. And so it was relatively small. Our previous estimate I think even for the fiscal year we have just to be up to $50 million kind of on a pre-tax basis. Now, our current estimate based on new regulations would say that probably for the fiscal year, this may be up to $20 million, $25 million, so just about half of what we expected, say prior to the final regulations. And so that was a slight benefit also.Kristen Stewart - Deutsche BankOkay. And did you have any gains on the sales, any investments I know that you guys were selling Weigao?Gary EllisNo, I mean nothing that\u2019s unusual I mean we have some periodically where we do some, I mean we \u2013 and then but we also had some impairments on some investments also from net-net, there was no real change.Kristen Stewart - Deutsche BankOkay. And then can you provide anymore color just around the, I guess, it sounded like it was a gain related to Ardian and the contingent to our future milestones just what the expectation\u2026Gary EllisRight. What we did on the non-GAAP, excuse me, on the GAAP financials reflects the $70 million gain, which is a reduction in the contingent consideration. So, this is as we made the acquisition of Ardian we had to record the accounting rules required you to record, what do you think your milestone payments are going to be and you have to book that as a continued consideration of liability as you go forward. Because of the obviously the regulatory process in the U.S. here and the enrollment I should say, the enrollment process has been longer than we expected and because of the slower commercialization uplift in Europe because of some of the getting reimbursement and some of these things, the whole things we have been talking about that Ardian, we are still excited about the opportunity, but the reality is it\u2019s coming a little slower than we expected. That means that the milestone payments that we would have to payout based on our current estimates and forecasts of how this will ramp up is left that you are kind of shifting things out a little bit and we are shifting things out past, some of it out past obviously the final milestone payment, which is in FY \u201815. And that gain because the liability has now been reduced, that liability is being reduced, it goes through the P&L as a gain. We recorded it\u2019s obviously in the GAAP financials, but we did not reflect it in our non-GAAP numbers, but it is a gain that company recognizes by reducing that liability.Kristen Stewart - Deutsche BankWill that also have any implications on the amortization and ultimately flows through once you get U.S. commercialization?Gary Ellis","No, because again the intangible assets and all the assets are related. The value of the Ardian itself we still feel very, very strongly about, in fact, if anything we probably feel that there is more value there long-term. It\u2019s just that if you think about the value has shifted out past the milestone payment.Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Okay, perfect. Thank you.Omar IshrakThanks.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] ","I would like to hand the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2020 third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer and Geoff Martha, Medtronic President will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 24th, 2020. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.","During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","For this call, unless we say otherwise, rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which compares to the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 after adjusting for foreign currency. References to organic revenue growth, exclude the impact of our Titan Spine acquisition and currency.","Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachment to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported results for the third fiscal quarter, Revenue growth was light this quarter, reflecting a series of largely transient issues which I'll walk you through in a minute.","The good news however is that this was more than offset by 90 basis points of operating margin expansion well ahead of our expectations resulting in strong EPS and free cash flow growth, both ahead of plan.","Importantly, despite the top line shortfall this quarter, our Q4 outlook is unchanged, as we expect significant revenue growth acceleration excluding any impact from the coronavirus.","Q3 revenue grew 2.9% in constant currency and 2.6% organic. Revenue growth fell short of our expectations, driven in part by customers curbing their purchasing ahead of our new product launches, principally in CVG and RTG.","In MITG, we upgraded the group's ERP system in the U.S. and Canada to our company-wide system, resulting in a temporary slowdown in our ability to supply customers, which in some cases resulted in loss procedures and lasted longer in the quarter than we anticipated.","That upgrade is now complete. And as of early this quarter we're in the process of returning to full supply. All of these items led to our quarterly revenue underperformance.","We weren't able to offset these issues, given that many of them emerged late in the quarter. I'm not happy with this top line performance and we are focused on quickly addressing the dynamics that led to this result. Geoff will provide a little more color on this later on the call.","Looking down the P&L, we drove significant operating leverage despite the softer top line. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points as we continue to see the benefits of our enterprise excellence initiatives, particularly on the SG&A line.","We also had strong financial leverage, driven in part by the debt refinancing that we completed earlier this fiscal year. This resulted in adjusted EPS of a $1.44 which was $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% year-over-year.","Let's take a look now at the drivers for our group performances, starting with our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3.6% organic this quarter. RTG\u2019s performance was affected by customer buying patterns in BMP and the continued market slowdown and slide share loss in Pain Stim ahead of our DTM therapy launch.","On an organic basis, our overall spine division was flat this quarter, reflecting customer drawdown of infuse inventory. Despite this, our Core Spine business grew 2% both globally and in the U.S.","In addition when you include sales of enabling technology sold by our Brain Therapies division, which is how our competitors report, Core Spine grew 5% organically both globally and in the U.S. well above market.","Our surgical synergy strategy is resulting in increased sales of our Core Spine implants, driven by surgeon\u2019s use of our capital equipment, in particular our Mazor robot. It is also benefiting our Brain Therapies division, which sells the capital equipment used in spine surgery. Brain Therapies delivered another above market quarter of 9.2% growth.","In neurosurgery, which grew low double-digits, we had strong growth in Mazor robotics where we are meaningfully outpacing the competition, as well as in StealthStation navigation, O-arm imaging and our new Midas Rex MR8 systems.","In Brain Therapies, our market-leading Neurovascular business had another strong quarter with mid teens growth driven by mid 20s growth in ischemic stroke and strong adoption of our Solitaire X stent retriever, Riptide Aspiration System and React catheters.","In pain therapies, the pain Stim market had another sluggish quarter and we had some slight share loss ahead of the launch of the Stimgenics DTM therapy on our Intellis platform.","We're excited about the response we received from physicians and the broader SCS community following the acquisition announcement and Stimgenics data presentation last month at NANS as well as on our nine year battery warranty on Intellis. We continue to be optimistic about the outlook for the Pain Stim market and have begun training physicians on the DTM waveform.","Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 3.2% organic, including flat results in the U.S. MITGs performance this quarter was affected by the upgrade of its ERP system in the U.S. and Canada which caused some temporary slowdown in our ability to supply customers with the full breadth of our products and in some cases resulted in loss procedures. This was however a transient issue. The ERP upgrade is now complete and the related supply slowdown are behind us as of this month.","Within MITG, our Surgical Innovations Division grew 3.6% this quarter, driven by our Advanced Surgical business, particularly in Advanced Energy, which grew in the high single digits on strength in our LigaSure franchise and sales of our Valleylab FT10 energy platform.","Respiratory, GI and renal division grew 2.2%, driven by low double digit growth in our GI Solutions business and high single digit growth in pulse oximetry sensors and advanced parameter sensors.","In our Cardiac and Vascular group we grew 1.8% this quarter, which was below our expectations, due in part to customers holding back their purchasing ahead of new product launches in CRHF.","We saw high single digit declines in our High Power business as customer\u2019s awaited approval of our Cobalt and Crome devices which have launched this month in Europe and are expected to launch in the U.S. during Q1.","In heart failure, although our LVAD business has anniversaried the headwinds we faced over the past year, the business declined in the low single digits and hasn't returned to the growth levels we were expecting.","The other driver of our below expectation CVG performance was our U.S. TAVR business, which grew 13% this quarter below the market growth rate. While the TAVR market has been rapidly expanding, we currently have fully experienced field support coverage in a little more than two thirds of the approximately 700 U.S. centers performing TAVR.","We began aggressively hiring and training new field personnel months ago. However, our data shows that its taking longer than expected for our new reps to reach full productivity. We plan to certify an additional 70 field personnel by the end of this fiscal year. We expect our US TAVR performance to improve relative to the market going forward, as our expanded field organization reaches full productivity and we focus the market on the hemodynamic benefits of Evolut PRO+ platform and the launch of our new Confida sheath. Outside the US, our TAVR market share grew modestly in Q3.","Our pacing business grew in the high single digits, well above the market, driven by our exclusive Micra leadless pacemaker and AZURE family of conventional pacemakers. We announced the Micra AV approval in the last week of our quarter and are excited about its growth potential, as it expands the Micra target population from 15% to 55% of pacemaker patients. While we did not have revenue from Micra AV in the third quarter, we are already seeing strong interest in early adoption of this new technology in the fourth quarter.","In diabetes we grew 0.8%, slightly ahead of expectations. Our U.S. business declined in the low double digits which is anticipated and resulted from competitor challenges, while we await our new products. We're seeing strong enrollment in our Next Tech Pathway program, which allows purchasers of the MiniMed 670G to upgrade for free to our next-generation pump when launched.","Keep in mind that as a result of this program we are currently deferring a portion of the revenue of our pump sales, which we will recognize when patients trade in their 670G for the next generation pump.","In markets outside the United States, which represents just under half of our diabetes revenue, we had solid mid teens growth, driven by the continued adoption of the MiniMed 670G. This demand is not only driving strong growth in our installed base, it is also resulting in double digit growth in recurring revenue from CGM and other consumables.","Now turning to emerging markets, which represented 17% of our revenue. In Q3 we grew emerging markets 14% with contributions from geographies around the globe. China grew 14% as in Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe grew 16%, which included 39% growth in Russia. In addition South Asia grew 13% and the Middle East and Africa and Latin America grew 125. We continue to drive strong growth in these markets as we optimize the distribution channel and in certain markets localize R&D and manufacturing.","Regarding the coronavirus, our top concern is the health and well-being of our employees in China and across the globe. We have activated response teams in China, the Asia-Pacific region and globally and we remain vigilant in monitoring the virus and taking action as necessary.","All of our manufacturing operations are up and running in China. We're committed to helping the Chinese government and Chinese physicians address this crisis. As the Chinese healthcare system is focused on containing the spread of the virus, hospitals in China have experienced a slowing of medical device procedure rates and we are seeing procedure delays. We do expect this to have a negative impact on our fourth quarter financial results. But given the fluidity of this situation the duration and magnitude of the impact are difficult to quantify at this time.","Now turning to our product pipeline. As we look forward, we're excited about what lies ahead, as investments we made in our product pipeline begin to pay off by accelerating our revenue growth and creating value for our shareholders. We have recently received approval, launched a number of new products that we expect to contribute to our growth going forward.","I mentioned earlier, the U.S. approval of our Micra AV peacemaker and the launch that is now underway. We also received U.S. approval for our IN.PACT Admiral AV fistula indication, which expands the market potential of our drug coated balloons.","We received U.S. approval and are launching our Stealth Autoguide cranial robotic system. In Europe, we recently received CE Mark approval for our Cobalt and Crome portfolio of BlueSync-enabled high-power devices, our InterStim Micro rechargeable implantable sacral neuromodulation device and InterStim SureScan MRI leads as well as our Percept PC DBS device with BrainSense technology.","And over the next few quarters we expect approval and launch of a number of additional new products. We expect U.S. approval of the Cobalt and Crome high-power devices, Reveal LINQ 2.0 insertable cardiac monitor, InterStim Micro and InterStim SureScan MRI leads and our Percept PC DBS device.","We're also expecting European launch of the MiniMed 780G and our DiamondTemp ablation catheter. Regarding our MiniMed 780G in the US, we intend to file our adult clinical data with the FDA in March which will push expected approval beyond the fiscal year end.","In Pain Stim, we unveiled DTM spinal cord stim last month at the NANS conference and are now training our field force on this novel waveform, with an expected limited launch in Q4 and full launch in Q1.","In MITG we continue to make progress in our soft tissue robotics program. Last week we announced the acquisition of Digital Surgery, a pioneer in artificial intelligence and analytics for surgery. They lead the industry with their unique Touch Surgery ecosystem of products, including AI that identify surgical steps and instrumentation.","These products can be leveraged to provide insight into the procedure time, cost and process to improve surgical care. We're excited about utilizing the strength and capability of digital surgery to advance our minimally invasive and robotic surgery platforms.","We also have a number of important upcoming data presentations, starting with the use case data under extreme conditions for our advanced hybrid closed-loop algorithm at ATTD later this week. Next month ACC will be a big conference for us.","Data from our OFF-MED renal denervation pivotal trial will be presented, as well as data for both low-risk bicuspid and leaflet immobility for our TAVR program. Also we will share risk stratification data for our TYRX anti-infection product. And finally, in June at ADA we expect to present the U.S. pivotal data for our MiniMed 780G advanced hybrid closed-loop system. These are just some of the near-term highlights from our pipeline.","Importantly, we're continuing to invest in building out a robust long term pipeline of continuous innovation, invention and disruption. I mentioned earlier that we expect significant acceleration in our fourth quarter revenue growth, driven in part by our pipeline and excluding the impact of the coronavirus. And as we look to our FY \u201921, we expect our top line momentum to continue as we get the increasing benefit of the FY \u201820 product launches, as well as the products slated to launch next fiscal year.","With that, let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and forward outlook. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you. As Omar mentioned, we delivered third quarter organic revenue growth of 2.6% and adjusted EPS with a $1.44 growing 11.6%. We ultimately came in $0.06 above the midpoint of our guidance and would attribute $0.02 to better than expected foreign exchange and $0.04 to operational outperformance, including tax.","Our adjusted gross margin was 69.7% down year-over-year due in part to increased China tariff. We more than offset that decline with strong operating leverage, as we continue to implement and drive efficiencies and improvements across the company, while at the same time making investments ahead of upcoming product launches.","This led to an adjusted operating margin improvement of 90 basis points or 70 basis points excluding the impact of currency.","Below the operating profit line, our adjusted interest expense declined 36%, driven by our successful debt issuance and tender transactions that we completed last spring and summer.","Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 13.6% lower than we expected due to increased deductions from the exercise of employee stock options and benefits from finalizing taxes owed uncertain returns.","As you know generating strong free cash flow remains a priority across the company and you are seeing this focus come through in our results. Third quarter free cash flow with $2.1 billion, up 21% from last year, and year-to-date free cash flow was $4.9 billion, representing a conversion ratio of 90% well above our full year target of 80% plus.","We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing investment in R&D and tuck-in acquisitions to drive future growth, while returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders and year-to-date we've returned $2.8 billion or 57% of the cash we generated, resulting in a total shareholder payout of 51% on adjusted net earnings.","Now turning to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we are comfortable with current Street consensus on organic revenue growth and EPS, to any impact from the coronavirus. We expect overall organic top line growth of approximately 4.5%.","By group, we expect CVG to grow 4.25% to 4.5%, MITG, 6.25 to 6.5%, RTG approximately 4% percent organic, and diabetes to be flat to down low single digits. And based on recent rates currency would have a negative impact of 80 to 140 basis points.","On margins, we continue to expect our full year operating margin to expand by roughly 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our enterprise excellence initiative.","For the fourth quarter, we expect our operating margin to be up slightly including the impact of currency or roughly flat on a constant currency basis, as we invest to support current and upcoming product launches.","Below the operating line, we expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be approximately $160 million to $165 million and our fourth quarter adjusted nominal tax rate to be around 16%, which would put our annual rate at approximately 15% lower than we originally expected and reflecting the benefits we have had so far this year.","We are raising our fiscal year 20 EPS guidance to a range of $5.63 to $5.65, up from $5.57 to $5.63 and reflecting our third quarter bottom line outperformance. For the fourth quarter we expect a $1.62 to a $1.64.","As mentioned upfront all of the guidance I just gave excludes the impact of the coronavirus, because the situation is so fluid it is difficult to truly quantify the impact just a few weeks into our quarter and for that reason we plan to provide an update for you later this quarter.","Finally, I would like to note that we plan to hold our Biennial Institutional Investor and Analyst Day on Tuesday June 2nd in New York City.","Back to you Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen. Id now like Geoff to make some remarks in the quarter and the outlook. Geoff?","Geoffrey Martha","Thank you, Omar. There are a number of positive things from the quarter that I want to highlight. But first I'd like to address our top line performance. Even though much of it was transient we did not perform at the level we were expecting and the drivers surfaced at the end of the quarter. We just can't have surprises like this, for us nor for you. And we are making changes.","At our upcoming Investor Day in June, I'm going to walk you through what innovation driven growth means for Medtronic and a comprehensive set of initiatives to take full advantage of the pipeline. These initiatives are meant to ensure we see the acceleration of our revenue from the pipeline and to improve our predictability.","On that note, I want to discuss an aspect of our plan to address the surprise we saw this quarter. One issue is the weighting of our revenue to the final month of the quarter, which leaves us susceptible to surprises late in the game like what happened this quarter.","Too often our largest orders come in at the end of the month. This dynamic makes the business challenging to manage, it stresses our operations and it really makes it difficult to mitigate headwinds that pop up within the quarter. So to fix this, we will change our current operating mechanisms, certain internal metrics and some incentives as well.","And I want to flag the opportunity coming up with our extra week in Q1. The impact of the changes that I just mentioned likely won't be contained in a given quarter. So I'd like to use a good portion of the benefit that we would get from the extra week in Q1 to launch these initiatives.","So when we guide to the first quarter we will give you guidance on an underlying basis, excluding the benefit of the extra week. And we'll give you an estimate of the benefit of the extra week net of these changes. Like I said, we plan to discuss these and other changes during our Investor Day. But I want to assure you one thing that I'm on this and we are taking the appropriate actions to improve consistency and avoid future surprises.","Now before I close and we get to Q&A, I've got to highlight a number of good things that occurred this quarter. Accomplishments that I believe can't get lost in this quarter's narrative.","First we drove a better operating margin despite the light top line and free cash flow was outstanding. These are two things that we've been working on for a long time. Over the past couple of years, we've taken action on both of these areas and we feel really good about the operating rigor and the culture we've put in place to drive the bottom line and improve cash flow.","Also emerging markets growth continues to be strong for us. They represented 17% of our revenue and once again grew strong double digits, 14% this quarter. We think of emerging markets actually as an independent growth factor for the company and we have to acknowledge the progress with our pipeline.","We are starting to see approvals and launches come through for important and innovative products and there's more to come. Yes, the slowed purchasing ahead of these launches hurt us in some businesses this quarter, but this is going to turn. Customers are really excited about our new offerings.","I like to end by saying that the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong. We have a full pipeline that will accelerate our revenue growth and take share not just next quarter but next year and beyond.","We're very excited about the future of the company. The new technology that we're bringing to market, the impact this will have on patients and physicians and the value we're going to bring and generate for our shareholders.","All right, back to you Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Geoff. I couldn't agree more with the approach that we are taking, and I'm just as excited about our outlook going forward. Before we start Q&A, I'd like to briefly note that we currently anticipate holding our Q4 earnings call which will be my last earnings call on Thursday May the 21st. Let's now move on to Q&A, in addition to Karen, Geoff and me our four group Presidents, Mike Coyle, Bob White, Brett Wall and Sean Salmon, are also here to answer your questions. As usual we want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary a related follow up. If you have additional questions please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you and good morning. Just I'll state both questions upfront to make it easy. First, I was wondering, in CVG, if we could drill down a little bit on ICDs given the weakness in the quarter and I ask because you know Boston Scientific also saw weakness in the quarter in their high power ICD business and the timing of your new launch you shouldn't really be a surprise. So I guess my first question is how can you have confidence that this isn't just a slower market? So that's question number one.","And then the thing I also love a quick comment on is that, I realize it's too early for formal fiscal 2021 guidance, but you guys have talked a lot about accelerating growth in fiscal 2021, so are you still comfortable accelerating off of that 4.5% that we'll see hopefully in the fourth quarter on the same selling day basis? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Bob. Mike Coyle is the right person to address the ICD questions. Go ahead, Mike.","Michael Coyle","Yeah, we're not seeing anything that would cause us to have a concern that the overall market for ICD is somehow slowing significantly. Most of the challenges that we have in ICDs remain the issue associated with the replacement cycle and the fact that we were seeing essentially mid teens declines in year-over-year comparisons on replacement.","As I've mentioned before that actually gets better as we get through the year and into next year, especially in the CRT-D area. And that is going to help us in terms of acceleration the ICD side.","But the other point and you pointed out the surprise to us in terms of weakness in the number for the quarter was really in EMEA, in Europe and Middle East and Africa. That was where essentially we believe customers were holding off given the imminent launch of our Cobalt and Crome product families which now have launched into the market. And those products will be coming to the United States during the first quarter.","The other thing that depressed the overall performance relative to where we thought we would be during the quarter is the fact that the TYRX anti-infective envelopes get captured under the ICD numbers when we report externally. And I think you may recall last quarter we had a fairly major you know, quality driven back order situation that we expected would be resolved completely during the course of Q3. We actually lost a number of \u2013 lots of product manufacturing, lots of product early in the quarter which now has stabilized. In fact, through the second half we're completely out of any kind of constraints on supply.","So we expect that will flow through into the numbers in Q4 and obviously into next year, especially as we have new data that we'll be presenting at ACC on risk stratification for TYRX. So we think all of those things are going to help us accelerate the ICD market not only in Q4 but into next year.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. Thanks, Mike. I think, Karen, you're the best person to take the question.","Karen Parkhill","Yeah. Thanks for the question on \u201821 Bob. Yeah, we're excited about our pipeline and what it has to offer for FY \u201821. I'd love to talk a lot about it, but we're close to finalizing our plan, so we'll give the official guidance on our Q4 call as you know.","That said, I would think about accelerating growth for next year off of a full year basis as opposed to off of a sequential basis. And we're very confident in our growth acceleration of FY \u201821 over FY \u201820.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just \u2013 maybe just one quick question for me here. Karen just to confirm for your last question is the right way to think about fiscal 20, I'm assuming a sort of 3.5% to 4%, but my one question I'll keep it to one is just to give a 4Q guidance I appreciate it's in line with consensus, but I think about Omar and Geoff\u2019s comments about RTG and CVG, it seems like the 3Q dynamics getting better into the fourth. Shouldn't the fourth quarter be stronger as we see some of this catch up revenues? If you just help us quantify the third quarter issues and offer some clarity what fourth quarter implies in terms of recovery and drivers of acceleration. Thanks so much.","Karen Parkhill","So let me take the beginning of it and then I'll let my colleague jump in too. So in terms of FY \u201820 that our fourth quarter guidance would imply FY \u201820 growth of 3.6%, 3.7%-ish [ph] And then on fourth quarter clearly because of the transient issues in the third quarter we expect some of that to come back.","You know if you look at MITG and the ERP issues that we've talked about, we fully expect that to come back. And that's one of the reasons that we've guided MITG to you know above trend for the quarter. That we have lost some procedures, and those won't come back.","Omar Ishrak","I think I don't know if I can add anything to that. You know, really the procedure losses in a business like MITG where the procedures happened that just isn't going to come back, will recover fully. I think in other areas like in the MCS business or LVAD business you know, that was share loss and there's pressure there and our growth is probably going to be lower than we were originally anticipating.","So in balance we felt that holding the Q4 sort of previous guidance was the appropriate thing to do at this stage. We're obviously doing everything we can do to maximize that number.","Ryan Weispfenning","Okay. Thank you, David. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robby Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robby Marcus","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we could shift to some of the product lines and specifically TAVR here, 13% worldwide growth came in a lot lower than the Street was expecting, you had the first full quarter of the low risk launch in the U.S., you're a competitor it did a lot better than this. Maybe talk to exactly what happened in the quarter, the dynamics in the U.S. and how you expect this to continue throughout fourth quarter and \u201921? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Mike, you want to take this?","Michael Coyle","Yeah, Robby. Obviously we were very disappointed with the performance in the US. If you look outside the US we - the implant growth rates were in the high teens and pretty much in line with the overall market. Actually a little better than the overall market because of the Japan influence.","But in the United States obviously well below market with implant rates in the mid teens, whereas we would estimate the market in the quarter probably grew on the order of the low 30s.","As we dug into that, we obviously headed into the holidays actually feeling pretty good that we were looking at implant rates in the low 20s. Obviously in retrospect that turns out to be lower than the market. But as we headed into the end of the year and into January, we saw a pretty meaningful decline in overall growth rates for implants and we dug deeply into that to figure out which accounts and where we were having the issues.","And basically I think learning from that analysis was that it takes longer than we thought to have our reps become fully competitive in this market. It's probably a 9 to 12 month training exercise which in retrospect we probably should have ramped up in advance of this several quarters earlier than we did.","The good news is that as we looked at the hiring that we did do, this quarter we expect to bring on 70 new sales reps and support personnel which is going to help us go from you know, given the 700 accounts that are selling ICD or selling - that are servicing this market, we probably have seasoned sales rep that is those who have a year or more experience in about two thirds of those accounts, by the time we exit with these new certifications that we would expect to be closer to 80% in terms of supporting that and we're also accelerating new hiring based on the driving support for our next fiscal year.","So we think those you know, just to catch up in terms of training and deployment, plus you, know we're pushing much more close interval management of the reps that are out there to make sure that we're staying on top of developments in these accounts.","We think that that coupled with obviously our new product launch around Evolut PRO+; the launch of the Confida sheath, which really improves the performance of our overall device systems and then new data that will be coming out here at ACC around both bicuspid and leaflet immobility, should basically give us an opportunity to accelerate from where we were in Q4 or in Q3.","And that you know, basically looking at just the daily sales rates here as we've headed into the new quarter with this new focus on rep productivity, we are seeing some acceleration from those numbers that you see in terms of the mid teens implant rates.","And so I'm confident we're going to see acceleration, whether we'll get all the way back to market, you know, given that we have two competitors who are driving share in those accounts it may take more than a quarter to do that. But on the other hand I do expect to see acceleration during the quarter.","Robby Marcus","Thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Robby. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had two quick ones. One, Surgical Robotics, I think you mentioned some software updates just on time line there, you know, MITG, you have sequential acceleration. Is there anything baked on the robotic side there?","And second, on margins. I appreciate the comments on you know, FX hedge gains you know, when you look at next year I think Geoff made some comments and changing incentives, so maybe just talk about margins for next year, are we still looking at in a constant currency you know, in the 40 to 50 basis points of expansion? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Let me \u2013 Bob, will probably answer this. But you know, I'll just say off the bat that robotics is not in our financial numbers yet, and the overall program is more or less on track. So\u2026","Robert White","That's right, Omar. Thanks, Vijay for the question. To reiterate, first off, no updates from what we talked about at JPMorgan relative to the program, so it's just good news. And then the sequential acceleration of MITGs business is really all about us coming out of the ERP implementation, now that we've got that back on track and the system is running smoothly. So I hope that does it for you Vijay.","Vijay Kumar","And then on the margins guys?","Karen Parkhill","Thanks, Vijay. On margins for next year, we're going to continue to look at margin expansion, as we drive bottom line growth about top line growth every year. At this stage we haven't changed our long range guidance of 40 basis points constant currency margin expansion. So you can assume that at this stage.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks, guys.","Omar Ishrak","I can tell you Vijay, there is a focus in the organization around that. We've worked very hard to get a - an accountability around that. And you know, we're going to - you're going to - that's going to stay. We just need to fix our top line growth back to where it deserves to be based on our product pipeline.","Vijay Kumar","Appreciate the comments Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thanks, Vijay.","Ryan Weispfenning","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matt Taylor","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So the first one I want to ask was just on MITG ERP transition. I was wondering if that impacted any of the business lines within MITG more than the others. And are you seeing underlying share loss there. Or share gains. Can you talk about the underlying trends?","Omar Ishrak","Go ahead.","Robert White","Yes. Let me take that Omar. Matt, thanks for the question. The impact of the ERP transition affected all of the MITG product lines as we migrated into the single SAP system for Medtronic. And you know certainly we lost some procedures where we weren't able to ship products to customers.","So while we think we lost procedures given the middle months of the quarter, we don't believe we necessarily lost a significant amounts of share. But certainly now that we're back on track with ERP system we're back to fulfilling those customer requirements.","Matt Taylor","Thanks. Just a follow for Mike or the team there. So it sounds like you're seeing a little bit of an improvement in the DCB trends at least in the U.S.. Could you speak to that and whether you think we could see any kind of continued uptick there or a change in the FDA stance at some point during the year?","Omar Ishrak","Go ahead Mike.","Michael Coyle","Sure. We are seeing some modest improvement obviously as more data sets come in, they are providing more comfort to physicians and FDA for that matter I believe, that the signal that had been observed in those first three randomized trials around SFA seem not consistent with the new data coming in.","Obviously one big dataset that we filed and got approval for was the AV fistula indication for DCB, which did not show this mortality signal in the paclitaxel arm. And we expect additional data to be coming out on that topic, including at the ACC where we think there'll be a presentation of a major data set based on claims, analysis.","So that is creating a greater sense of confidence in the physician base that the significant morbidity issues that come with not using these drug-coated balloons and just using PTA balloons are beginning to get attention. And I think what we expect to see is continued improvement as data sets provide that - that level of comfort.","So in this quarter we did see, on sort of selling day [ph] adjusted basis some sequential growth which is encouraging in the DCB and we expect if the data continue to come in as positive as they have that we'll see that continue.","Matt Taylor","Thank you, Mike.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Matt. Next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Sean if you could just provide us his overall thoughts on diabetes since kind of taking over the role. And then if we could just kind of get an update on 780G, it sounds like that is getting pushed a little on the US into next fiscal year or maybe just some thoughts around timeline there? Thanks.","Sean Salmon","Sure. Thanks, Kristen. So as you know the diabetes business certainly has no small challenges to overcome, but I can tell you I'm really very encouraged with how we're seeing some derisking of the pipeline that we have going forward, in particular that sensor pipeline. I'm convinced that we've figured that out and it's a bit of time for us to get the pipeline flowing there.","The 780G is an important catalyst for us to drive growth and we expect that to begin. We have filed the CE mark for that device, and we are anticipating, as Omar said, putting the clinical data module in the March timeframe. That review is going well. We're very interactive with FDA that we'll be meeting with them later this week and we'll give more update on exactly when the timing is as we get more information on it.","So far we're happy what we're seeing both in the algorithms and you'll see some of that later this week as we stress the algorithm into some challenging conditions that will be announced at ATDD and that data flow and you'll see the full data set coming up at the ADA in June.","So I'm seeing a lot of encouraging things as there are things to clean up obviously. We've got to get the new product flow going and we're confident that we'll be doing that starting soon.","Kristen Stewart","And then just your comments around the derisking, particularly around the sensors. Can you just expand upon that? Do you think there's an opportunity to bring forward some of the sensor timelines?","Sean Salmon","Kris, I think the first thing is to meet the criteria for iCGM, and I'm confident that we're going to be able to demonstrate that, we'll have more information on that in the coming meeting. But probably at Analyst Day we'll show you some more of that. Its too early to comment on accelerated timing, but that's certainly the goal to push as fast as we can into the marketplace.","Kristen Stewart","Perfect. Thanks, Sean.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Kristen. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with SunTrust.","Kaila Krum","Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. So one quick one to clarify and then a question on the business. So on the coronavirus, I think you may have mentioned this but again just to clarify. Will you give full transparency on your China business performance in the fourth quarter?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. We will. And we do disclose our growth rate in China already. So we will we will continue to disclose that. We will be transparent about the impact of the coronavirus.","Kaila Krum","Perfect. And then there's - there's obviously a lot of new product launches coming in the next few quarters. But I mean obviously it can be challenging to predict that the timing and the impact of when those new launches contribute. So I'm just curious how you're modeling your product contribution in the fourth quarter and as part of that re acceleration in the business? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Well there are some that are pretty clear, things like the Micra AV, which launched last quarter is now in full steam and moving ahead well, and that one you know we're projecting a strong - strong success.","There are others like the in the spinal cord stimulation market, we just launched the Stimgenics waveform on the Intellis platform. That's picking up. That you know, we were a little more guarded about that because that's newer. But for sure that's going to help us in the spinal cord stimulation market.","Things like Cobalt and Crome in Europe, again, we have a history there and we can - we can project historically what such - that kind of improvement has caused and where we're going to put that into a model. So you know there's a mix of the level of you know sort of confidence intervals we have in these projections some very tight and you know Micra being one of the biggest drivers is very tight. The other is a little more unknown but positive nonetheless. I think that's the best I can do - or anyone else here, any products I've missed or any comments, you guys?","Brett Wall","We've recently we've recently launched the Micro which is the new public health product in Europe which you know we're excited about that and the possibility for that looking to late spring launch in the United States. And then Percept, which is the new DBS with brain sensor technology has just launched in Europe. Similar timeframes in the U.S. approval and we're getting good uptake on that. So those are two very interesting platforms for us in the neuromodulation space.","Michael Coyle","And the other thing I would mention is the DiamondTemp ablation catheter CE mark that we expect during the quarter which would obviously be even more of a benefit in Q1 of next year, as well as we're just in the early stages of the launch of the AV fistula indication for the IN.PACT Admiral balloon, so those will now get full quarter benefit during Q4.","Omar Ishrak","I think to your question about how we project these you know, there's a historical sort of comparison that we can make against similar such launches and based on that we make a judgment in our in our planning and from that we derive guidance and our plan going forward. So there's a variety of that, but you know there's some judgment involved with this.","Kaila Krum","Thanks, guys.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Kaila. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Mike, could you please put a finer point on the launch timing of that Cobalt and Crome in the U.S. and LINQ 2.0. What quarter are you expecting it. And Brett, on SNM, what are you seeing - for sacral neuromodulation, what are you seeing from the new competitor and what are your expectations for that business before micro is approved in the U.S. in late spring which I heard you say a minute ago. Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Michael Coyle","So Larry on Cobalt and Crome, we would expect that in the first quarter of next year probably in the first half of that quarter and then for LINQ 2.0 we would expect that product also in Q1 but in the second half of the quarter.","Brett Wall","Yeah, then Larry on public health and on the Micro I think we you know expect some near-term slowing here with that particular product given the competition, the Micro itself in Europe has been received very well, just as a reminder it's about half the size of the competitive device, the recharge experiences significantly better and with the SureScan leads, leads, it is 1.5 and 3 Tesla full body conditional. So we're very, very excited about that product when it comes to the market in United States.","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Larry. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matt Miksic","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I just have one on coronavirus and one on sort of the simplicity spiral timeline and post the data at ACC. So on corona, I understand a little bit early to put a finer point on the impact for Q4, but if you could maybe give us some sense of what the major moving parts are. I think we have about $2 billion dollars in China revenue round numbers, approximately kind of an annual run rate there. Obviously it's a moving target but you know things like what an impact in Q4 likely you know based on what you know now sort of come back in early Q, you know how transitory is that impact?","And then on Spyral, just maybe walk through us with forward for us the timeline of what happens after OFF-MED and what that looks like as you continue to develop that that program?","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Let me take the coronavirus question first, first of all we're pretty clear about where would our China businesses, it's roughly 7% of our global business. So you know you can - you can do the estimate there. You know the variables right now, one variable is that we've got to get our factories up and running so that we can supply you know different places in the world including China. And that is actually progressing well.","But the main factor driving the number there will be the procedure uptake in China. You know China was in a complete shutdown mode for the first half of February and they're just beginning to start and even now even in places like Beijing and others procedures are only just beginning it's too early to tell how that will ramp up to the rest of the quarter.","We know that in Hubei Province for example obviously shut down but that's solely a you know 5% of China there. But you know the rest of China in places like Beijing and Shanghai right now there are procedure delays.","In addition to that a lot of physicians are being asked to actually go and help with the virus. And so you know there are many dynamics here that really difficult to predict. Now once the things stabilized it could well be a ramp back up. And because you know people need the procedures they've - they will get them at some point.","When that happens is very difficult to predict right now. So that's why we're saying that wait till a little later in the quarter when we have some more data and see how things progressive we'll give you a full update. So with that, I am going to ask Mike to take the renal.","Michael Coyle","So our renal denervation, obviously, the first big milestone will be the pivotal trial on the OFF-MED, which will be presented here at ACC. But there is the second trial that is ongoing in parallel which is the ON MED trial. Unlike the OFF-MED, it has a six month efficacy endpoint. So if I were to set expectations for when those data were to become available I would expect that about a year from now. So about this time next year.","In terms of the FDA interaction the ON MED or the OFF-MED data will be used in a modular submission as we know along with obviously the device supporting materials. So we think we can get the process with FDA to move forward and we do think we need the OFF-Med \u2013 excuse me, the ON MED data set in order to get final approval for the product and certainly it will be very important in terms of reimbursement to have those data.","So that would be how I would set expectations. Obviously I think you know this final product is available in Europe currently and it does have CE Mark. So as these data sets become available you know customers can evaluate them and decide how they want to use that product.","Matt Miksic","Great. Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Matt. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks. Mike, I just want to circle back on the 4Q CVG growth outlook. It sounds like some of the headwinds there like LVADs and TAVR may take at least another quarter to address. I'd imagine that there's potentially some risk that U.S. ICD growth slows ahead of those launches just like we saw in Europe. So Micra AV should help, there's a couple of things that go your way which is the confidence in driving that acceleration in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Michael Coyle","Sure. I think as you point out you know, we have lowered our expectations for the LVAD numbers just based on you know not seeing the sequential share capture in Q3 that we had seen in Q2. You know, it's some competitive indications approvals. But on the other hand you know obviously we got the Micro AV early in terms of you know we expected that it would be later in the quarter when we were setting guidance last quarter and the customer response has been strong in terms of interest in the technology.","And as a reminder this is a product that carries a 3x price uplift relative to a standard dual chamber system and our indications for use cover all AV patients. So we expect that an opportunity to drive this product meaningfully into the market above what we were thinking a quarter ago when we were giving guidance for Q4.","In addition although obviously the Cobalt and Crome products won't be in the US they will be in Europe. And so unlike last quarter where we really had no meaningful new products and we saw the customers pausing and while waiting for new products. Now we have a number of new products globally that are obviously going to make a difference for us. And so net, net we're pretty much holding our expectations for growth where we were a quarter ago despite the moving pieces in this quarter.","Chris Pasquale","And does the guidance contemplate a pause in U.S. I see the orders ahead of those launches?","Michael Coyle","It certainly shows no meaningful acceleration in those - in those numbers, so its something along the lines of what we've had. And as I said we're also seeing some improvement in the replacement cycle generally because of the CRT-D side of things.","And the other thing I should mention is obviously we will anniversary in March the paclitaxel issue, which was a big step down in the prior year quarter which gives us just an easier comp to work with as we've seen sequential growth on a selling base basis the last couple of quarters in DCB.","Chris Pasquale","Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","I don\u2019t disagree that TYRX, although we won't get to share capture this quickly. We certainly have sequential growth.","Michael Coyle","Absolutely. That we were constrained for more than half of last quarter in terms of supply and now we are essentially unconstrained. And in addition, we are expecting to get labeling expansion to one year dating on that product in the United States which will help us significantly in terms of just the logistics of its growth.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Chris. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank.","Pito Chickering","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. To follow up on Rob's question on U.S. TAVR, I understand if sales rep issues are holding back growth of new accounts. But are the sales reps really holding back growth and establish accounts. Is that where the growth is falling? Is it from the new accounts or from established accounts? Thanks so much.","Omar Ishrak","Yeah, it's a great question. Actually what happened was there was a tremendous focus on launching the Evolut PRO+ as well as opening up the NCD accounts. And what we wound up doing because of the relative maturity of a good bit of our field force is pulling reps who were supporting large accounts to help with that expansion into new accounts. And obviously with a new competitor entering the market, and you know some complex messaging having to come in as well as you know low risk patients were approved. It just proved to be too much.","We were spreading our field too thin. And so you know obviously we've refocused back into those large accounts to make sure that our messaging around hemodynamics, the benefits of the Evolut PRO+ in terms of profile are now adding the pericardial wrap into the large device segment and then obviously just selling the benefit to the hemodynamic data that was presented at ACC a year ago. Those are things now that we believe are helping to show this acceleration in growth that I referenced as we head into this quarter versus where we were in January.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Pito. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Sandler.","Matthew O'Brien","Morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'll just stick with one. Geoff, I appreciate you don't want to say much about this new program that's going to implement until Investor Day in June. But you know we've seen contract manufacturers do something like this before but never really a manufacturing company do something like this.","So can you just talk about the potential economic impacts to Medtronic. I mean, do you have to scale to kind of you know work through some of these things on the top line if you're going to be better pricing there to be a little bit of gross margin pressure or longer term so there's some free cash flow impacts here. So just how do we think about you know some of the puts and takes here of this new program?","Geoffrey Martha","Yeah. Well you know, look - and just one clarification on when I spoke about, I think this is the second question around where some of these changes impact are margins and the answer to that is no, right. We've you know we're talking about focus on increasing our revenue and the overall revenue growth, as well as the consistency and predictability of that revenue growth, but we don't want to take a step back on them - on the margin improvement that we've - that we've built up and the cash flow conversion improvements that we had done over the last couple years as a result of our - these are sustainable changes from our enterprise excellence program.","So we don't want to take a step back on that. What I mentioned this morning, on this morning's call was a very specific changes that we want to make to improve orders that are coming in late in the quarter. We have a couple of our larger orders, you know, that were coming in late in the quarter which stresses our system and we've got to execute better really to get those in earlier. We're putting too much pressure on the last month and that that's specifically what I spoke of this morning.","And what I hinted at for Investor Day was more on what are we doing to realize the full benefits of the pipeline. We look - the fundamentals of the business are strong. What I mean by that specifically you guys know the markets are doing well. We have a good market share positions, but more importantly in terms of momentum the product pipeline is coming to fruition here.","So we need to make sure that we put the right programs in place to realize the full benefits of that pipeline you know, around commercial execution. So that's we'll get into more of that on Investor Day. What I talked about this morning was more having a regular cadence - a moving some of our back end loading of our quarter and spreading that more evenly throughout the quarter. But nothing regarding you know, nothing change regarding margin.","Matthew O'Brien","Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","All right. Thanks, Matt. I think we've got time for one more question please operator.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two questions for Karen on margins. Just on the gross margin pressure you've experienced so far in fiscal \u201820. Can use to help us understand the drivers of that. And is this and it's sub 70% level the new normal? Or is there a recovery path? And has it been FX, pricing pressure, mix shift?","And then just on the other income tailwind that you've experienced in fiscal \u201820 outside of FX hedging can you talk about the drivers of that benefit and then how sustainable and predictable that line item will be going forward? Thanks for taking the questions.","Karen Parkhill","Yeah. Thank you, Josh. No problem. So on gross margin one of the larger prices that we\u2019ve had on gross margin is the increase in China tariff. And as long as they stay that will be a continued pressure.","Gross margin is obviously impacted by mix and as we introduce some of our key new products that should help gross margins going forward. And as we think about the net other expense or income line item, we had a benefit this quarter that was primarily driven by a swap program that we have in place to hedge the gains and losses that are part of our deferred compensation program and SG&A. And so that was really driven that. Our SG&A line would have been even better if it didn\u2019t have a loss that we effectively offset by a gain in net other.","Josh Jennings","Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Josh. Omar, do you want to wrap up?","Omar Ishrak","Yeah. Well, thank you all for your questions and behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Look we'll get this thing right. We've got a task to do here, we\u2019ll get acceleration growth profile in Q4 and that will continue into FY \u201921. Our product pipeline is strong and this team is committed behind it, we couldn\u2019t have \u2013 I couldn\u2019t have asked better team and more committed and we\u2019ll get this thing right, I assure you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Please go ahead.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Jacky. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fourth quarter conference call and webcast.","During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016, which ended April 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.","Next, you should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website investorrelatation.medtronic.com.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 respectively and all quarterly year-over-year growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. Our annual year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which in addition to adjusting for the negative effect of foreign currency translation includes Covidien Plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.6 billion representing growth of 6% which was at the upper end of our mid single-digit baseline goal and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Q4 important non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.27 growing 18% on a constant currency basis.","Before providing more detail on our Q4 performance, I would like to recap fiscal 2016. FY\u201916 was a transformative year for our organization, our first full-year after closing the largest ever Medtec acquisition. It was a year where in addition to executing a large complex integration, we closed 14 additional acquisitions totaling $1.5 billion.","It was a year where we launched a number of ground breaking new products and extended our thought leadership within value based healthcare. We delivered record revenue of $28.8 billion grew at the upper end of our mid single-digit baseline goals and capped off our fourth consecutive year of achieving mid single-digit revenue growth. Our performance was broad based with strong progress against each of our three strategic pillars, new therapies, emerging markets and services and solutions.","Our FY\u201916 non-GAAP dilutive EPS of $4.37 was in the upper half of the guidance range we established at the beginning of the year, representing constant currency growth of 15% and EPS leverage of 780 basis points. We executed in the Covidien integration synergies, delivering approximately $355 million in the fiscal year, which contributed approximately 440 basis points to our FY\u201916 EPS leverage.","We improved our operating margin by 100 basis points including 120 basis points of improvement in SG&A. we reinvested in R&D organically as well as inorganically, absorbing any diluted impact through EPS and capitalizing on our strong free cash flow generation. These investments are in-line with our stated strategy and further support the sustainability of a long-term growth and market leadership.","In FY\u201916, we un-trapped approximately $10 billion of our cash, which provided additional returns to shareholders, allowed us to pay down debt and increased our financial flexibility. We also increased our dividend substantially by 25%. We returned $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases well above our minimum commitment of 50%. Despite our strong operational performance in FY\u201916, a non-GAAP diluted EPS only grew 4%, after including the 47% negative impact of currency.","While we do have an earnings hedging program to reduce volatility and are looking at natural ways to limit the impact, reduce [the risk] as largely upside our control and we feel that over the long-term [indiscernible].","Now moving to our Q4 performance, 6% revenue growth was very strong especially when considering this was built upon 7% growth quarter in Q4 FY 2015. We continue to outperformed the market and the strength of our diversified portfolio was evident across our groups and geographies. Solid performances in diabetes, CVG and MITG more than offset the challenges we faced in certain businesses in RTG.","Geographically, we had strong 15% growth in emerging markets and solid mid single-digit growth in developed markets, including 4% growth in the U.S., 8% growth in Western Europe and 11% growth in Australia and New Zealand. Overall, we are pleased with the consistent performance in each of our three growth sectors New Therapies, Emerging Markets, and Services & Solutions.","In New Therapies, we delivered above goal performance in Q4, contributing 390 basis points for our total company growth. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 80%, new therapies are driving strong market outperformance. We are helping to create rapidly growing markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacements, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF Cryoablation therapy, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons.","In CRHF, we continue to see strong share gains in high-power from the ongoing launch of Evera MRI ICD as well as the recent launches of the Amplia MRI and Compia MRI, Quad CRT-D. We also saw exceptional growth of over 50% from our TYRX infection control products.","In Q4, we received FDA approval for our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System, the world\u2019s smallest pacemaker one-tenth of the size of the traditional device. We also received FDA approval for our Visia AF ICD, a unique single chamber device that can sense in both the atrium and the ventricles using proprietary detection algorithms. First developed for our highly successful review of legacy insertable loop recorder.","In CHS, ourResolute Onyx DESdrove sequential share gains in Europe and ourResolute [Technical Difficulty]cathetergained potential share in the rapidly growing TAVR market.In APV[Technical Difficulty]system drove above the market growth.[Technical Difficulty].","Over the past two years, our CVG organization has demonstrated industry leading levels of concerning driven R&D and productivity across its businesses and our forward-looking product pipeline looks equally robust. Mike Coyle will share more details on what is head for CVG at our investment in next week.","Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6% led by strong above market performance in Surgical Solutions and low single-digit growth in the Patient Monitoring & Recovery. Growth in MITG is coming from five key growth drivers, open to minimally invasive surgery or MIS, Gastrointestinal diseases, lung cancer, End-Stage Renal Disease and respiratory compromise.","Open to MIS grew double-digits in Q4 helped by the recent product introductions in our Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy portfolio including the LigaSure Maryland, Endo GIA Reinforced Reload, with Tri-Staple Technology and Valleylab FT10 energy platform. GI diseases and lung cancer also grew double-digits with solid growth in our GI Diagnostics business resulting from strong PillCam performance in the U.S. and Europe.","We received FDA clearance in Q4 for expanded indications for our PillCam Colon 2 capsule to potentially reach more patient\u2019s interest for colon cancer. Revenue in Renal Care Solutions doubled largely as a result of the acquisition of Bellco a pioneer in hemodialysis treatment solutions. Respiratory compromise grew in the up or single-digits benefiting from our capnography market development efforts.","We also continue to make progress in bringing our new Capnostream 35 to market in FY\u201917. MITG continues to supplement their businesses with tuck-in acquisitions. In addition to Bellco, the business recently agreed to acquire Smith & Nephews highly profitable and fast growing gynecology business that would complement our existing global [UIM] (Ph) product lines. We expect this acquisition to close this summer, we also recently signed an agreement to take a majority ownership in the Netherland Obesity Clinic or NOK, which I will touch on later.","Across MITG, we are developing solutions that span the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication free recovery and enhance patient outcomes through less invasive solutions. Bryan Hanson will discuss these strategies in more detail at the next week\u2019s Investor Day.","In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 3%, we also have a number of new products in neurovascular our SOLITAIRE FR Mechanical Thrombectomy device is delivering strong results, solidifying our leadership position in the rapidly expanding ischemic stroke market. Even off to the anniversary of the New England Journal of Medicine Articles last year. Our flow diversion products for the treatment of intracranial aneurysm Pipelines Flex in the U.S. and Japan Pipeline Shield in Europe continue to lead the market.","In Surgical Technologies, we had mid-20s growth in imaging driven by strong customer demand for our new O-arm O2 surgical imaging system. In Advanced Energy our business is annualizing at over $250 million. Our Aqua Metals system andPEAKPlasmaBlade are driving consistent upper-teens growth. In Core Spine new product introductions across several procedures resulted in a sequential improvement to our growth rate. Specifically we are seeing incremental revenue from our differentiated overlook procedures as well as from the recent SOLERA, VOYAGER, Elevateand PTC interbody launches for key lift and mid lift procedures.","We are also realizing some early benefits from speed to scale initiative, which accelerates innovation and enables rapid deployment of these product and procedures to the entire market. Looking ahead, we are expecting FDA approval for our differentiated 2-level Prestige LP our officialCervical Disc in FY\u201917. Strong seven-year clinical outcome date in the 2-level Prestige LP were presented earlier this month at ACC.","As expected, we face challenges in our neuromodulation division, while we continue to make progress against our FDA Consent Decree Commitments, we are still experiencing double-digit revenue declines in our drug pumps. Our revenue has been relatively stable sequentially for four quarters, so we expect drug pump growth to be roughly flat going forward.","In DBS and Pain Stim we are facing increased competition, but as we look ahead we are optimistic that drivers which has expanded early onset DBS reputation in the U.S. that we received earlier this year a new strategies that the focus our pain strategies in the growing Opioid epidemic and improve our neuromodulation results. On balance however, Pain Stim and DBS could be under some pressure for the next several quarters.","As we enter FY\u201917 we are realigning our businesses within the Restorative Therapies Group to provide a stronger focus in the diseases and conditions that we serve. Externally will report revenue results for four divisions comprising RTG. Spine, which includes our Core Spine, BMP and Kanghui businesses, brain therapies which includes our DBS which we are now calling brain modulation, neurovascular and neurosurgery businesses and pain therapies, which includes our drug delivery, spinal cord stimulation and interventional spine business.","[Technical Difficulty] which we are now calling Pelvic Health. Advance Energy and ENT will be reported externally as a specialty therapies division. As part of these changes RTG is adopting the general manager structure that has proven very successful in driving a steady cadence with meaningful innovation in our Cardiac and Vascular Group.","Additionally, RTG has aligned its commercial organization to this new structure, enabling the group to use its breadth to deliver solutions to hospital administrators and payers while maintaining focus on specialist physicians. Jeff Martha will discuss these change as well as additional details and its turnaround efforts in spine and pain at the Investor Day next week.","In our Diabetes Group, which grew 10% we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G systems in markets where it's available. Insulin pumps grew over 30% in developed geographies outside the United States. Despite having anniversaried the launch of the MiniMed 640G this quarter. We also had a strong quarter for MiniMed Connect which is the only system providing remote access to pump and sensor data on the users Smartphone.","Regarding our pipeline, we are on-track to submit the PMA for the MiniMed 670G with the Enlite 3 CGM sensors to the FDA before we end of -. Once launched, this would be the world's first hybrid closed-loop system. Also this quarter, we were pleased to reach an agreement with United Healthcare to be their preferred insulin pump provider.","United Healthcare saw what others including UK's NICE have seen that we are the only company with evidence that clearly demonstrates the clinical and economic value of our integrated pump and sensor platform for both patients and for the healthcare system. Our agreement with UHC is a real affirmation of our strategy to invest in innovation that drives evidenced based outcomes.","In our non-intensive diabetes therapies business, we continue to make good progress driving our iPro 2 professional CGM system to Type-2 patients being cared for by primary care physicians. Through our partnership with Henry Schien and our recently announced collaboration with Qualcomm Life, we expect continued success in our Type-2 business. In our Diabetes Service & Solutions business, we are on-track to launch Guardian and Connect in Europe with the current enhanced Enlight sensor in early FY\u201917 and in the U.S. with the next generation sensor in the second half of FY\u201917.","Guardian Connect allows us to provide both Type-1 and Type-2 patients on multiple daily injections with a standalone real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our standalone professional CGM products with the application in cognitive competing capabilities that we would bring through our partnership with IBM, we will provide both Type-1 and Type-2 patients with not just a sensor, but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution.","While the market remains competitive, we feel strongly that our diabetes business is well positioned to drive sustained growth and Hooman Hakami will provide more details on our strategy and progress at next week\u2019s Investor Day. Our new product pipeline is robust across all four of our business groups and we are confident that we can drive sustainable growth of our New Therapies growth factors in the upper half of 150 to 350 basis point goal.","Next, let\u2019s turn to emerging markets. In Q4, we grew 15% and contributed approximately 185 basis points to our total company growth, well within our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points. We continue to consistently deliver double-digit growth in emerging markets, overcoming macroeconomic pressures in certain countries.","This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies of channel optimization, government agreements and private partnerships. All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance. Our emerging market performance also benefits from increased geographic diversification, reducing dependence in any single market.","We continue to believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies in emerging markets represents a single largest opportunity in Medtec over the long-term. In Q4, our businesses in Middle East and Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe all grew in the upper-teens and India and China grew in the low double-digits. Next week at our Investor Day, we will have the chance to share more details from the leaders of our global regions.","Turning now to the economic value growth strategy, our Services & Solutions growth factor contributed approximately 25 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, Services & Solutions continues to achieve revenue growth around 50%. We expect to further improve our growth contribution as this model is expanded across all our business groups.","In Care Management Services formally known as Cardiocom, we grew in the high-20s in Q4 driven by strong growth within the U.S. Veterans Administration Healthcare System. Care Management Services represents an important platform for us especially as post-acute care services becoming even more critical and bundle payment models for different interventions.","In our Hospital Solutions business for which we provided expertise in operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating, we had service revenue growth in the high-50s. Since starting this business a little over two-years ago, we have completed a total of 88 long-term Managed Service Agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $2 billion in Contracted Service and Product revenue over an average span of six-years. One of the majority of these hospitals are in Europe.","We also have management contracts in hospitals in Latin America and in the Middle Eastern Africa. We are attracting strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in the regions around the world have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We continue to make progress in expanding the hospital solutions model from cath labs into operating means utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have already signed 10 operating Room Managed Services deals, representing approximately $250 million in cumulative revenue with an average life span of seven-years.","We are also expanding our solutions offering into Chronic Disease Management, one example is Diabeter, a Netherlands based diabetes clinic and research organization we acquired a year ago, which is currently operating four centers providing holistic diabetes care management. Another example is NOK, a chain of clinics in the Netherlands for moderately obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We signed an agreement to acquire a majority stake NOK this month.","NOK offers patients an integrated comprehensive care model, including extensive screening, [pre-care] (Ph) program, bariatric surgery, post-surgery program and long-term follow-up. Their approach is highly successful and we plan to gain critical insights with the goal of expanding NOK\u2019s clinics to more countries providing broader patient access to the multi disciplined teams of specialists in improving patient outcomes.","Through initiatives like Diabeter and NOK, as well as the ones I mentioned earlier, we are uniquely positioning our business to focus not just on devices, but providing services and solutions across their continuum. While all of these services and solutions are still relatively early stage businesses that represent important building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value based healthcare offerings where business models will be based on measurable patient outcomes over specific time horizons.","Our organization is scoring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with provider and payers.","Turning now to the Q4 P&L, we grew non-GAAP diluted EPS by 18% and EPS leverage was 1210 basis points both on a constant currency basis. Covidien cost synergies were over a $100 million in the quarter were in-line with our expectations helped drive a 180 basis points improvement in SG&A and were a major contributor to our strong EPS leverage. In addition, our business also delivered strong underlying operating leverage in Q4. The combination of Covidien synergies and underlying leverage resulted in a 260 basis point improvement to our operating margin after adjusting for unplanned items.","Our non-GAAP operating margin including the dividend - impact of proceeds was 40.3%, which was 70 basis points below the expectations we had at the beginning of the quarter. This was a result of three unplanned items that negatively affected the gross margin. First, an additional 30 basis points from the FX impact in inventory that is based solely on intra-quarter currency fluctuations.","Second 20 basis point impacts from one-time such as accounting step-up on the Bellco acquisition inventory. And third, a 20 basis point impacts from higher than anticipated scrap in obsolescence across each of our groups. Without these specific unplanned items, our non-GAAP operating margin would have been 31% and within our expected range. Despite these pressures, we were able to offset the unexpected items to bottom-line.","Turning to capital allocation, we are deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We remain firmly committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth.","Last year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow our dividend faster than earnings, with the intent of reaching a 40% dividend per share payout of prior year non-GAAP EPS in the near-term. Regarding share repurchases and FY\u201916, we began executing the incremental $5 billion share repurchase we announced earlier in the fiscal year, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase program. Competing a total of $2.3 billion in net share repurchases in FY\u201916.","We also continue to use our capital to make strategic and discipline M&A investments, which must need our portfolio criteria. Namely, the targets must provide a line of site to improving outcome, allow Medtronic to add value and we have a committed team in place that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution.","Before going to Gary, I would like to note that in a transformative year with a significant number of contacts moving parts our team delivered. Our strong results would not have been possible without the dedication teamwork and passion that are 85,000 employees around the world demonstrated every day. We have undertaking the strategy to transform healthcare, we don\u2019t take lightly the challengers this lofty goal places in our organization. And it has been amazing to see what our combined organization can accomplish.","We have formed a common culture and are collaborating with our partners in healthcare to serve millions of patients around the globe fulfilling the Medtronic mission of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life. We are building on a track record of delivering consistent mid single-digit revenue growth and with every quarter we are increasingly confident about the sustainability of this performance.","While we recognize that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we are well our way to meet our integration synergy, free cash flow generation and EPS leverage commitments. We are looking forward to sharing details of these plans with you at the Investor Day next week. Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our fourth quarter results. Gary.","Gary Ellis","Thanks Omar. Fourth quarter revenue of $7.567 billion increased 4% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $179 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Acquisitions and divestiture contributed a net 60 basis points to Q4 revenue growth.","Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 36% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 8%, with all three divisions growing above the high end of our targeted mid single-digit range. In CRHF, we expect to continue to grow above market due to our differentiated MRI implantables portfolio and other new product introductions that Omar mentioned.","We have now started U.S. physician training and shipments of our Micra TPS pacemaker. In AF Solutions, our business grew over twice the market in the mid-30s, and is now annualizing at over $0.5 billion. AF Solutions had another very strong quarter with aortic plan advanced following the compelling FIRE AND ICE trial, which was featured as a late breaker at ACC and simultaneously publish in the New England Journal of Medicine.","Later this month, secondary endpoints from the FIRE AND ICE trial and rates of re-hospitalization and repeat ablation procedures will be highlighted in the late breaking clinical trials at the Cardio Sym Congress. In Coronary, we are holding global drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitor launches. Due to our customers\u2019 increasing preference for Resolute Onyx in Europe and many emerging markets, continue enthusiasm for the delivery characteristics of [Technical Difficulty] integrity in the U.S. and our expanding use of CVG multiline contracts in many geographies around the world.","In Transcatheter Valves, we are seeing strong growth and we expect this market to grow $4 billion to $4.5 billion by 2020. Our U.S. share stabilized after the drop we saw in Q3, but not having a large size Evolut R. We started our Evolut R XLclinical which is a 60 patient 30-day follow-up trials. In intermediate risk, we completed enrollment in our SURTAVI trial, which is expected to lead to FDA approval and we are moving into continued excess for intermediate risk patients at 60 U.S. SURTAVI centers.","In Q4, we also saw strong acceptance of Core Valve in Japan following the first full quarter of launch. In peripheral, we had a number of strong data presentations on our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon last month that Charing Cross. Including mechanisms of action data, which are resulting in competitive account conversions.","We also received FDA approval for a change to impact labeling, removing requirement or pre-dilatation and replacing it with simple appropriate vessel of preparation. These labeling changes now positioned Medtronic as the only company in the U.S. that develops, manufactures and sells both atherectomy and drug-coated balloons as combination therapy for SFA disease.","Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 32% of our total company sales grew revenue 6%. We continue to monitor surgical volumes in the U.S. and we estimate there may have been a slight acceleration in the most recent quarter with volumes now growing approximately 3% versus 1% to 2% range we saw earlier in the fiscal year.","We are seeing stronger mid single-digit growth in the U.S. outpatient surgery market while inpatient surgeries are going in the low single-digits. In PMR quality issues related to the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator and CapnoStream 20 capnography monitor had a combined impact of approximately $25 million in Q4 revenue. We expect to have both of these issues resolved this summer.","Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales grew revenue by 3% with strong growth in neurovascular and surgical technologies and an improved results in spine which offset low single-digit declines in neuromodulation. Our U.S. Core Spine business declined 1% a large improvement over the past two quarters. We estimate the U.S. Core Spine market is growing 2% to 3% so while the last year-over-year we did gain over a 100 basis points per share sequentially.","We expect spine to return to market growth over the coming quarters. In Europe we continue to be affected by the ship hold in our InductOs BMP, which is resulting in an impact of approximately $8 million per quarter. Our latest projection is that our third-party supplier will be able to resolve the issue some time during Q3 FY\u201917.","In neuromodulation it is worth noting that our Q4 growth was affected by the divestiture of the [indiscernible] drug, which occurred in late Q3. This business was generating $7 million to $8 million per quarter. Our diabetes group, which accounted for 7% of our total company sales grew revenue 10% with strong broad based performance across all three divisions. It is worth noting that the diabetes group double-digit growth came in the face of the competitive U.S. environment. We attribute this performance to our focus on building the diverse revenue streams through geographic expansion and growth in our new business.","Products like MiniMed 640G system with Enhanced Enlite sensor and Smart Guard technology helped drive growth outside the U.S. while our non-intensive diabetes therapy and diabetes services and solutions divisions also contribute to overall performance. And while we expect the tough U.S. competitive environment to continue until we get FDA approval for MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system, we believe that our sufficient drivers will continue to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit global growth in our diabetes group.","Now turning to the P&L. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.27, an increase of 18% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.10 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.78.","In addition to the $348 million after tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on and after tax basis were $118 million charge relating to the retirement of $2.7 billion debt a $97 million net restructuring charge and $85 million charge for acquisition related items and a $44 million impairment charge related to an investment in bio control.","The Q4 operating margin was 31.8% on a constant currency basis. This represented a 210 basis point constant currency improvement over the prior year. After adjusting for the negative 30 basis points for the one-time Bellco acquisition inventory step up a negative 20 basis points for the unplanned scrap and obsolescence, the operating margin would have shown a 260 basis points constant currency improvement which fell in the range of our expectations. It is worth noting that ASP declines were in-line with previous quarters and did not affect the gross margin.","Our operating margin included a gross margin of 69.8%, SG&A of 31.1% and R&D of 7.4% all on a constant currency basis. Also included in our Q4 operating margin was net other income of $21 million, which included net currency gains of $102 million primarily from our earnings hedging programs. These currency gains were $37 million lower than the prior year.","Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies during this volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are unhedged especially in emerging market currencies which can create modest volatility in our earnings.","Below the operating profit line Q4 non-GAAP net interest expense was $188 million, slightly better than our forecast. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $31.2 billion in debt and approximately $12.6 billion in cash and investments of which approximately $5 billion was trapped. In Q4, we prepaid approximately $2.7 billion of our debt utilizing a portion of the $10 billion of cash that was entrapped in a transaction last September.","Our non-GAAP normal tax rate on a cash basis in Q4 was 14.6% this was an improvement to our forecast and included an approximately $40 million benefit from the reversal of evaluation allowance associated with foreign net operating losses from our interventional spine business. In Q4, adjusted free cash flow was $1.4 billion, which was below our expectations due to timing on certain items but we expect it to recover going forward.","We remain committed to returning the minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target in any credit profile. In Q4, we paid $531 million in dividends and repurchase $660 million of our ordinary shares. As of the end of Q4, we had a remaining authorizations to repurchase approximately 72 million shares. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,416 billion shares.","Before turning the call back over to Omar, let me conclude by commenting on our initial fiscal year 2017 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Our baseline goal is to consistently grow our revenue in the mid single-digit range on a constant currency basis. For FY\u201917, given current trends, we expect revenue growth to be in the upper half of the mid single-digit range at 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis, constant basis which excludes the estimated negative 150 basis points annual impact from the extra selling week we had in Q1 of FY\u201916.","Assuming current exchange rate to remain similar for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a $1.11 euro and 1.10 Yen our FY\u201917 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $25 to $75 million with modest FX headwinds in the first half of the year turning to modest FX tailwinds in the back half of the year.","In Q1, we would expect revenue growth to be in the lower half of our 5% o 6% annual revenue outlook range on a constant currency constant week basis. Our Q1 revenue growth outlook excludes the estimated negative six percentage points impact or approximately $450 million from the extra selling week we had in Q1 FY\u201916 as well as negative $25 to $75 million FX impact on revenue based on current rates.","Turning to guidance on the bottom-line, we believe it is reasonable to model non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.60 to $4.70, which includes approximately 225 to $250 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition. While the expected FX impact on earnings per share from our unhedged currencies has improved by approximately $0.05 since March, this has been offset by our increased expect the FX impact on inventory.","Given this, assuming current exchange rate to remain similar for the remainder of fiscal year, foreign currency would have a $0.20 to $0.25 negative impact on our FY\u201917 earnings per share. Our guidance implies earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 16% on constant currency basis after taking into account the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra selling week in Q1 of FY\u201916. For the first quarter of FY\u201917 we would expect earnings per share growth on a constant week basis to be around the upper end of our annual earnings per share growth guidance range.","However, it is worth noting that on a reported basis, we expect Q1 earnings per share relatively slightly down given the estimated $0.08 to $0.10 negative impact from the extra week and the expected negative $0.06 to $0.08 of FX based on current rates. As usual, our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Gary. While I have more to say next week at the Investor Day, I did want to take the opportunity to recognize Gary\u2019s service to Medtronic today in what is his last earnings call as Medtronic's CFO. Gary has served in this role for the past 11-years and since May of 2005 and has been with Medtronic since 1989.","Gary has been a constant counsel to me during the time that I have been here and his experience and knowledge and overall guidance has been critical and invaluable to both me and our overall team, as we have navigated through a very complex environment. Gary\u2019s expertise will be missed, but he will still stay on as IT and Operations leader at least for a little while and we will still have the benefit of his strong counsel, more on that in the Investor Day.","And we will now open the phone lines for Q&A and in addition to Gary, I\u2019ll ask Mike Coyle, President for Cardiac Investor Group; Bryan Hanson, President for Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President, Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of Diabetes Group to join us.","We want to try to get to as many people as possible. So please help us by limiting yourself to only one questions and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have any additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me just try and clarify few items. So one, could you just maybe make a little bit clear for the FY\u201917 guidance, what does that assume in terms of your margins. Second, I think I understood the commentary on the first quarter, basically you are saying down side on a quarter basis, so let\u2019s call it as 102, 103. Just want to clarify that? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. I\u2019ll let Gary kind of take this one. Go ahead.","Gary Ellis","Yes. I mean as far as FY\u201917 margins, we would expect going forward based on the assumption obviously of the earnings per share on a constant currency basis growing 12% to 16% as we indicated. But the operating margins would obviously continue to improve similar to what you saw in the current year. Obviously the synergies in the Covidien integration as we indicated in the call would be a little bit less for next year, but the operating leverage from the rest of the business would be obviously a little bit more, if we move into the FY 207 period of time.","So operating margin improvement, we are not getting into specific on that, but basically the assumption would be Mike that assuming a 12% to 16% constant currency earnings per share growth. You are going to see a similar kind of growth in operating margins similar to probably what you saw in the current year [indiscernible]. As far as the Q1 guidance, what we are trying to indicted in the call is that yes we are in the kind of that upper end of the range, taken into effect the extra week, et cetera. I think you are probably - the 102, 103 you mentioned is probably right and its well within that ranges is what people could probably be assuming.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And Gary, I was asking on the FY\u201917 margins, because the incremental inventory hit from FX. I\u2019m just trying to think about the actual impacts on reported margins for the year? I would assume at that [indiscernible] get that range.","Gary Ellis","Yes, I agree, it will be. I mean you are right. On a constant currency basis we will continue to see in kind of improvement? The FX impact in the first quarter up $0.06 to $0.08 reflects that we are going to still see more FX on the inventory in that number. We saw a little bit higher number here in Q4 than what we had originally expected and that\u2019s what based on our guidance at this point. Obviously that number continues to get even worse that could be a different issue.","But right now, I think it will be a slight negative, but have mitigated, I should say some of the operating leverage we are getting on a constant currency basis as we saw during the current year. But we would expect to see again on a constant currency basis that would continue, but as reported you are right, it might be less of an impact in Q1. Thanks Mike.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And then Omar maybe just two questions. So one the commentary around surgical volumes, is obviously consistent with what we have seen from companies reporting from across the sector over the last month as well as not just device companies, but the hospital companies. Can you just tell us was the commentary about the uptick in surgical volumes is consistent over the course of the quarter, I mean is this something that you have seen even in April and maybe into May if you have insight into that? And then second, I was hoping you could just comment on the diabetes business, because your international performance was exceptionally strong this quarter and just trying to look forward to what\u2019s going to play out in the U.S. once you get 670G approved here? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Just a few words and then I\u2019ll let both Bryan and Hooman kind of give you some more details. First, I think we saw steady improvement in surgical volumes through the course of quarter and I\u2019ll let Bryan comments in a minute on the continued outlook. Why don\u2019t you say that Bryan and then I'll take on diabetes. Go ahead.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I don\u2019t know that I would give specificity in the quarter, but I would say same thing across the quarter. So on more volume growth and what we had seen in the last few quarters. We use a bunch of data points to be able to get to that. One of the big data points that I personally use is calling our sales reps, because we are out in the operating room and we see the number of cases. And there is definitely feel there was increase in volumes during the quarter. Until I see it for another couple of quarters, I\u2019m not calling it a trend, its one quarter, but certainly felt nice in the quarter.","Omar Ishrak","And with diabetes I'll let Hooman comment, obviously we are very excited about the potential the hybrid closed-loop system. But I also very attention to much of the commentary around our broader based efforts, that is one aspect of growth in diabetes. I think we are very excited about what we can do about overall patient management and in our agreements that we can make the major stakeholders such as payers liquidated this last quarter. Hooman do you want to say few words?","Hooman Hakami","Yes, sure thanks Omar. Hey Mike. I would concur with what Omar said, I think if you take look at our performance this quarter, 10% growth is strong, it was largely driven by OUS revenues and 640G and I think it just show you what kind of uptake we can get with the new product launch. The U.S. continues to be competitive and here we have a product that was launch in September of 2013. And so we don\u2019t have the benefit in the U.S. of a new product like we do in Europe.","But I think it\u2019s underscores a couple of things. One is what Omar said is that our revenue base is becoming more and more diverse and we are seeing more traction from OUS revenues, from emerging market revenues and from call it non Type-1 revenues with Type-2 and Services & Solutions. The other thing that I think it shows is that when we do get a next generation platform here in the United States, we can expect some great results.","The traction we are seeing in Europe and the feedback that we are seeing on our new pump platform is great we expect to see that here in the United States, once it\u2019s launched. So as we get the 670G, we think there is going to be really strong uptick there and as you heard from a commentary things are on-track with respect to that.","And then finally, the last point I would make it between now and when the next generation pump comes out Mike, we have got a log assets that we can leverage within the diabetes business in the U.S. the size of our sales force is the largest the size of our clinical team is the largest in the U.S. We have got the largest sale and service infrastructure for patients, we have got deep and broad payer relationships and on top of that we have got a growing Type-2 and solutions business here in the United States.","So, we feel good even though the competition continues to intensify in the U.S. we feel good about our overall global performance and then once thing come with the new product we feel very, very good.","Michael Weinstein","Thanks Omar. Okay.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Mike. Next question?","Ryan Weispfenning","We will go to next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just a few piece of question here? Hi guys, first question Gary just to rectify fiscal 2017 guidance of non-Op items. Your free cash guidance for next year is very strong, I wonder if you could update us on two points, one is just the size and timing of anticipated buybacks in the guidance as well as the potential tax rate for fiscal 2017 and I have a couple of quick follow-ups?","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Go ahead Gary.","Gary Ellis","Well, as far as the free cash flow, the guidance that we are giving $6.5 billion to $7 billion for next year is in-line kind of what we are expecting from our operating earnings growth and continued focus on working capital. So that expectation we do expect as we have indicated previously and we will talk more about it at the investor meeting that our free cash flow will continue to grow very nicely probably close to the double-digit range similar to the earnings as we go forward. So we are feeling confident about that.","We are not getting specific obviously about what we are doing with share buyback, but as we indicated previously, when we announced the incremental buyback and if you watched historically, we tend to do that we said we are going to be more front-end loaded on that. And so I think you could assume the same thing as we go into FY\u201917 and its more front-end loaded than towards the back half of the year. So but we are not giving specific about how much we are going to be including in that piece of it.","So as far as tax rate goes, I mean there is obviously the befit of R&D tax credit catch up during the current year. if you take that out of the equation, going forward we haven't provided any specific guidance on tax rate, but basically we are saying that your tax rate is going to be relatively flat with where we were currently at. So I wouldn't expect any significant uptick or reduction.","David Lewis","Okay. That's very helpful Gary, thank you. And then may be just a follow-up or two here. Omar or Gary I guess there has been a lot of focus as you know on quarterly margin performance for the net until we've have got the senior management is that there is a long-term margin opportunity here. Can you talk a little bit about your confidence and sort of long-term margin assumptions? Why you believe at double-digit earnings? How it can sustain it for a few years and I think about the Covidien synergy number you gave today, you know 225 to 250 certainly gets you to an 850 number in a few years, but it may not get you above that 850 number. So what is giving you the confidence that you can deliver this sort of may be double-digit earnings for longer?","Omar Ishrak","Well, a number of things, you know in the Investor Day this will be our core subject, because we want to explain this to you in detail. But look it starts with our revenue growth, so you should kind of get to our mid single-digit revenue on a consistent basis otherwise you got a big hill to climb here. So revenue growth has to be sustainable and has to be consistent and that is something that we are feeling as I said better and better about.","Having said that, then we need sort of operating leverage like you said and that in the short-term promising Covidien synergies, but what the Covidien synergies do is it builds a platform for us from which we can continue the same work. As we keep growing taking advantage of our scale in our functional costs primarily, we think we have got productivity that has a long tail, a long tail that we can continue to do.","And in addition to that our product cost reduction will also has good sustainability as we consolidate our manufacturing operations, which we really haven't even built into any of the synergies at all in our $850 million number, because we feel that that would take longer than initial three-year period.","In the interest of preserving revenue and not taking any risks that's why we didn't jump into that but what it does, is it gives us a continued sustainability beyond the three-year period. Those are the two main things it's an area of extreme focus for us and we think it's very important for us to build the plan that's sustainable and that's diversified in a way that is reliable and we will walk you through a lot of those in Investor Day but that's essentially how we are thinking.","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks so much and Omar. I'll get back in queue.","Ryan Weispfenning","We will go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you and good morning everybody. I wanted just to go over to the CVG business for a second. And maybe you could talk a little bit more detail about the performance of the transcatheter valve business and help us understand the path to returning to market type growth in the U.S. and may be what you are saying specifically from an end-market growth perspective how that's evolved since ACC and highlight your relative competitive positioning?","Omar Ishrak","Go ahead Mike.","Michael Coyle","Yes, so first the overall growth of the market is at the high-end of the ranges that we had been speaking about in prior quarters. So the global market appears to be growing in the mid-30s, our reported growth this quarter is in the high-20s. I think the primary difference between our growth and the market growth is the performance of the large valve segment of the Evolut R. we don\u2019t have available yet the 34 millimeter version. If we do get that product we would expect to be able to have its share of performance and perform like the other three sizes do and provide us the share growth opportunity.","So that would be the primary for the current dynamics. In terms of overall market growth, obviously both international U.S. growth is well above as I said the high-end of where we have been thinking that the market would go. We think the positive date in the intermediate segment that has been available A from a competitive and B from our own sub analysis of our high risk data, [Technical Difficulty].","Essentially an expectation that by the time we get to 2021, we should be looking at a market that is around $4 billion with some modest penetration of the low risk segment and of course we have now started clinical trial activity in that low risk segment. So I think that would be our picture of the market there currently.","David Roman","Okay, and maybe as a follow-up on the P&L I mean clearly you have elected not to give segment margin - P&L margin guidance or modeling help whatever you want to call it for 2017 versus what you have given in the prior year. And given the investor focus on those metrics, it\u2019s going to very clear about how to think about this for FY\u201917 that the context should be essentially stable-ish to maybe slightly down gross margin, leverage on the SG&A line. You have this dynamic with other expense giving you modest reported operating margin expansion, a flat tax rate and down share count is what gets you to the $4.60 or $4.70. Are those the right moving parts to think about in the model for FY\u201917?","Omar Ishrak","That\u2019s pretty good.","Gary Ellis","Yes, without giving any model view you know I think you have summarized it well. Again, we are trying to focus on what the two levers that we are driving revenue in the bottom-line and the leverage we talked about there. But you are right, to achieve the constant currency earnings growth that we highlighted in here, we are going to have to continue getting operating margin improvement, which we expect with not only the Covidien integration synergies but clearly with what other operating leverage components we are driving.","The gross margin, the only comment I would make to our comments is, I\u2019m not sure that the gross margin will be down, it\u2019s possible that it will be on an as recorded basis because of FX, but the reality is we are expecting some of the - assuming some of our synergies will be coming in manufacturing line. So it\u2019s possible you could see the gross margin being flat to may be slightly improving. But that\u2019s probably the biggest fluctuation we saw here in Q4. So I think your assumptions for next year the way to laid it out is probably not a bad assumption right now until we can actually show that we can improve the gross margin a little bit.","David Roman","And just to be clear, I was laying that out on as reported basis just to reflect the numbers that could end up in consensus because that\u2019s where we also myopically focused right now. So that\u2019s why I was saying down on a reported basis, but operating margin slightly better on a reported basis year-over-year?","Gary Ellis","That\u2019s right.","David Roman","Okay, got it. Thank you very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks David.","Ryan Weispfenning","We will go to the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Hi thanks and good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Omar Ishrak","Yes.","Robert Hopkins","Great, good morning. So two questions, one looking backwards and one looking forwards. First looking backwards, Omar I would love to get your take on something, you guys have really been performing very well on the top-line, but over the last two quarters you kind of struggled to get to your goals on operating margins. And I just want to get your take on that. I mean is this the case where you are just not quite giving yourself enough room with guidance to account for the normal fluctuations that you see or are synergies maybe you expected a little bit more, just wanted to get your take on the last two quarters from an operating margin perspective?","Omar Ishrak","I think it really is the guidance being too tight. I mean look our main area of focus is our overall EPS and we felt that we are always moving partially with the balance and get to an EPS number. That tight of a guidance that we have talked about before was really directional in building the overall EPS and if we knew that there was going to be that much scrutiny on the operating margin line we would never have given such a tight range.","I mean the sorts of things that happen, there was no way we predicted them and with things like the Bellco acquisition and its map, we haven\u2019t really done that accurately, because we just closed the acquisition like a week before the we did our earnings call. And when we laid it out, some of these elements became obvious and there were pressures and its absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term and it\u2019s a extremely accretive kind of positive deal for us but on a immediate three-months basis you can get surprises.","So really our guidance should have been more thought through and we really feel that moving towards an EPS goal is the right way to look at our company. Because it\u2019s a company with a lot of assets and capabilities and we think that it has been good mid single-digits, deliver EPS leverage to an extent that gives us double-digit EPS growth, return 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders on a consistent basis. I mean that\u2019s a pretty good deal if we can do that at a constant currency level. Gary do you want to say a few words?","Gary Ellis","Yes. Bob, I think you said it well. I mean in hindsight if we would have realized how much focus was going to be on the operating margin line, we probably clearly would have given a broader range when we were talking about that at the end of our Q3 earnings call. You know 30 basis point range that we gave on an as reported number were the FX anything else moving 30 basis points is $27 million.","And $7 billion company with FX and all these moving part. That was my mistake, we should not done that, but we didn\u2019t realize the focus everyone is going to have on it. And reason I think we were trying to address that and get it out for the modeling was exactly that, it\u2019s not that we are not getting synergies. In fact, if anything the Covidien synergies and other operating leverage we are getting across the organization, we feel very good about and we are attracting that on a very tight basis.","It\u2019s the other moving parts that you just get from a large organization like this that we get specific uncertain-line item is creating an issue. So what we are trying to as Omar said, is focused on we are driving top-line, we have plenty of levers including all the costs synergies that we are achieving to drive the bottom-line. But in general, there is going to be some moving parts in middle and we were way to specific in Q3 on tight range on the operating margin and that was my mistake.","Omar Ishrak","And you know these moving parts we hope to offset at the EPS level, because then that gives you the full flexibility to be able to that. So that\u2019s the way in which we are modeling our business.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. Thank you for that. That\u2019s helpful. And then one other question kind of looking forward on the 2017 guidance. First, are you going to provide any longer term directional guidance at the Analyst Day on the 6th? And then secondly, just seems like on the Q3 call, you gave some preliminary thoughts on 2017 and it seems like what you are doing today is just sort of narrowing that range with a few moving pieces. But as I look at across the business, there are couple of things that it would suggest have gotten better, I mean that you have done a deal that looks a little bit accretive, you did refinancing it looks a little bit accretive. So I might have thought the EPS guidance would be a little bit higher. So I just wonder if you could comment on those two things. Any long-term thoughts and just maybe some thoughts on the 2017 guidance?","Omar Ishrak","We will certainly discuss the long-term strategy at the Investor\u2019s Day, so just hold on for a week for that one. And in terms of the guidance, look like we just mentioned earlier, there are a lot of moving parts here and we have been burnt by FX before. And so, we just wanted to be reasonable in our approach and that\u2019s the most accurate, I mean it\u2019s not virtually conservative, nor is it a virtually aggressive kind of an estimate that we gave, it\u2019s a fairly broad range. And obviously we do our best to maximize performance. That\u2019s really the best I can do there with that range.","Gary Ellis","Yes. Again, remember Bob at the Q3 call, we really didn\u2019t give any guidance for FY\u201917, we just said remember these factors as far as when you are putting together your thoughts for FY\u201917. And I think we basically have come in, as you said we have tightened up a little bit from that and as far as where we are at. FX it has been moving around, I mean you looked at even just a few weeks ago, it\u2019s probably not $0.05 benefit from where we were - but may be as much as another $0.03 or $0.04 higher than that. So the dollar strengthened again a little bit.","So we are being somewhat cautious, because as Omar said, FX has continue to be a headwind for us and we expect that in the next year. You are right, from and operating perspective, things are going very well, the revenue is strong, we are getting the operating leverage we would expect. But there is also lot of still moving parts, we still have a lot of integration efforts we have to get done, we are going live with SAP in Europe for the Covidien amities this week. So there is just still a lot of moving parts and we think the range we have given is consistent is what we communicated before and consistent with our long-term strategy.","Robert Hopkins","Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Bob.","Ryan Weispfenning","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company.","Josh Jennings","Hi good morning gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to just ask first quarter on organic top-line growth guidance that you provided for fiscal 2017, it\u2019s a little bit of tighter range than we are used to. Clearly your confident in the lower end of the ranges at north of 5%. But can you just help us think about how you set the top end of the range at 6% and whether you are leaving some conservatives in guidance and what needs to happen in order to get to above that top end of the range?","Omar Ishrak","Well, we need to deliver what we talk about the first. So before we think about going above that. First of all, the range is tighter that\u2019s true. And we did emphasize a word given current trends. We are overall committed in the mid single-digit range and we feel that given our performance and given the diversity of our portfolio, we can get to the upper half of that range like we have discussed. And we need to first deliver that consistently before we talk about meaningful upside beyond that.","Like I have mentioned in previous calls, what would trigger any thought of consistently delivering over that would be a fee, sort of over achieved on each of our growth drivers, New Therapies, Services & Solutions and the Emerging Markets for few quarters in a row. Only then we will have confidence that more than 6% is sustainable. You will get the odd quarter where we do, do better. But you will get some pressures on other quarter. So I don\u2019t want to bank on that yet.","Like you said, it is a tight range and it\u2019s something that we internally did debate about, but given trends and the fact that we have been holding that level of performance over a significant period of time sort of makes us feel reasonably confident that it\u2019s something that we can achieve. So that\u2019s I think the best response I can give on that one.","Josh Jennings","Okay, thanks. And just a question on longer term margins. As the Services & Solutions business continue to contribute to the revenue base and top-line growth in more meaningful levels, can you just talk about how should we think about their contributions impact to margins as we move forward into fiscal 2017, 2018 and beyond? Thanks a lot.","Omar Ishrak","We will lay some of that out in the Investors Day, but essentially as you pointed out Service & Solutions net operating margin on its own is usually lower than what we get from a device perspective. However, in all most all of these transactions and agreements we have make, there is a device component that gets attached to it and we get incremental overall revenue and we find that overall our operating margin dollars go up significantly as a result of these transaction. And then as we go forward, we expect to see productivity from those Services & Solutions arrangements both from the services themselves, but also from hopefully lower cost of sales in some of those accounts of support sales.","That's the way we are looking at it, it's something that we feel that we have to cover in our overall model and yet deliver the EPS that we are talking about. And that's what we are focused on and use every other variable that we have to cover for that, because we do think that the Services & Solutions gives us a sustainable long-term growth which was very sticky. And besides that it's something that our stakeholders and customers want. So it\u2019s something that we got to manage from our overall business perspective and not get too kind of align that and focus on that one. Do you guys want to add into that?","Bryan Hanson","No, I mean I think you said it Omar, I mean in and out of itself the Service & Solutions business has a lower margin just by its very nature, but the reality is there is benefits that also benefit rest of the company from those Services & Solutions that actually can potentially help leverage some of the margins on those sides of the equation.","So it's a little bit of a headwind especially here in the near-term as Omar said, but as we get efficient at it we get more productivity out of it, in general we don't think it will have a huge impacts on our overall operating margins. And obviously it will help solidify and give us more sustainability in our overall revenue growth and even in our overall shares.","So we feel good about the prospect overall and how it may increases the bottom line growth, but I think you are right in and out of themselves all those contacts the Service & Solutions component has a slightly obviously lower margin than the rest of the business.","Omar Ishrak","I think there is an important point if I can just follow-up, just to give you a specificity. We just this acquisition of NOK in the Netherlands that's a business which does bariatric surgery as well as other services and support areas and the net operating margin of that business is lower than our average, but sort of reasonable. When you layer in our surgical devices into those contracts on a consistent basis that drives up our volume on very high margin devices, which gets coupled to this transaction and therefore increases the overall margin rate significantly in those kinds of accounts from what NOK originally had. And so that's the kind of thing that we think we can scale around the world and get significant benefit.","Josh Jennings","Okay great. Thanks very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Josh.","Josh Jennings","Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","We will take that two more callers please. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor","Hey thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back to your earlier comments about surgical volumes. I was curious if you had any thoughts around sort of what is driving the incremental improvement, is it economy or coverage or products. What do you attribute some of that improvement to?","Omar Ishrak","Well, give that it is consistent with what all the hospitals are reporting, I have got to say that the overall healthcare demand if you like in the U.S. is something that is on an upward trajectory. That's got to be the fundamental reason and it's probably some of it is just natural demographics which provides this. The other is probably we are seeing some of the impact of the Affordable Care Act and all of the initial pieces of increased coverage might have been more sort of upstream in nature in diagnostics and so.","I mean some of these will lead to more procedures. Those are the only things that I can sort of intelligently kind of talk about. Other than that just what we experienced. It is not something that\u2019s easy to predict to be fair and we look at all kinds of different factors and do the best, we have leading indicators, we talk to people and we get a sense for it, but everything that I just said was close to conjecture in my part.","Michael Coyle","I would state the same, I mean it's very difficult even to get - you got to go to the different data points and triangulate just to get a sense of what is happening to the volumes, to go deeper level than that and understand why it's difficult to make assumptions, but it\u2019s very difficult to pinpoint specific reason. The other thing I would reference beyond just the increase in overall volumes, the other thing that we are seeing is a mix shift, a much greater growth in the MIS procedures versus [indiscernible] and this is pretty consistent when I look at other players in the marketplace and I look at their revenue growth in the quarter.","So I\u2019m really happy about that and truthfully that's probably the bigger opportunity, a smaller uptick in surgical volumes in the U.S. versus a real change in the make shift MIS, although the make shift MIS all day along. And that\u2019s pretty consistent again with what we have seen and what the rest are telling us and what we are seeing from other companies that are playing in the same space. That\u2019s to me is really the story.","Matthew Taylor","Thanks, and just one final, you did a little bit better, this quarter you were flat. Can you talk about your overall strategy there that you recently announced the deal with Meso can you talk about some products flow and other improvements that could help [indiscernible]?","Omar Ishrak","Sure. We detailed some of are in the commentary, but I\u2019ll let Geoff kind of comment on that directly. So go ahead Geoff.","Geoffrey Martha","Yes sure, so heading the Meso deal I mean we are very excited about that. That is I'll call it one-way of multi-pronged strategy around what we call surgical synergies and we feel as we move out into the future, this surgical synergies will be in spine our calling card. We have got very strong enabling technology platforms in navigation and imaging, we are excited about the partnerships in robotics with Meso and then integrating these platforms as we move forward to provide to differentiate spine procedures both economically and surgeon experience. Low radiation, just an easier surgical procedure et cetera, we think is going to differentiate our spine business.","And so as you move forward and this isn\u2019t five-years from now, this is going to take place quarter-over-quarter as we continue to emphasize this. So this is something we are very excited about. And as we move forward, outside of surgical synergies, we do have a number of products starting in our FY\u201914, FY\u201915 our spine business put a lot of effort into revamping the product portfolio and the products that are hitting the market now are Elevate Cage for example, VOYAGER another one and this quarter launching our or OLED procedures, I\u2019m calling then our second generation OLED procedures. We are getting a terrific uptick in these things.","My only regret is that two quarters ago when we are planning we didn\u2019t plan aggressively enough and because I think we are hitting our maximum with sets and if we had more sets, you see more growth. So that\u2019s something that we are factoring into our planning going forward to deal a little bit more aggressive, but both from a product standpoint and then from what we call surgical synergy standpoint things are looking very good for our spine business right now. And as you pointed out, every quarter we have improved over the last five quarters and it\u2019s a big shift, it take a little bit of time to kid of change directions and we should see continued improvement quarter-over-quarter.","Matthew Taylor","Great. Thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Matt. We will go to one more caller please.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, thanks everybody. Hope you all had a happy Memorial Day weekend. I had a couple of questions. Just wanted to go back to the RTG and the new reporting divisions. Is there anything I guess to be set forth to kind of the four different businesses? Is it more just alignment with the underlying surgeons or is it just to kind of facilitate maybe better structure to improve the performance? How should we think about that? I\u2019m just kind of curious it has anything to do with just perhaps isolating spine and perhaps thinking about it as maybe less core.","Bryan Hanson","No, actually it is not isolating, it\u2019s the other way around actually. But Kristen there is a couple of changes going on and we will get into this next week, but just summary. One moving into these different reporting divisions is really putting the businesses, organizing them by disease, state or condition versus technology and the example I'll give is neuromodulation.","I mean that was the business largely held together based on technology implantable stimulator and from whether the gastro euro which we are now calling Pelvic Health or whether it be DBS or pain stim they are all calling on different physicians, specialties and we really felt we would get more traction if we organize by disease state versus by technology.","So that\u2019s going to help us one, focus on the physicians appropriately and two, innovate because when we are innovating we are looking across the disease sate and across the character changing rather. So that\u2019s the one change and the other change that Omar mentioned in the commentary was moving into this general manager structure.","So that gets to more execution and this is something that CVG has done over the last four-years, five-years where you are having General managers that are 100% focused on the individual therapy segment that they serve in this products within that therapy segment. So making your businesses more smaller, more focused and granular.","So that\u2019s another component of that and along with this we have fairly sweeping leadership changes across RTG and many of the leaders that are now running a group have top performers from other parts of Medtronic. And so combined with the different structure, the disease state organization with this GM structure to drive innovation and we have new proven players from other areas of Medtronic, we feel very good as we hit FY\u201917.","Michael Coyle","And again to clarify the spine comment. Look, this is specific spine customer and the only thing we did is remove interventional from that and that is not the same customer. It made a lot more sense to group that together with pain, where we have a lot of associated therapies and we were missing the big picture look at pain by splitting up all the different very significant non-opioid therapies that we had. And so this is really a disease based look and look at our customers and that will drive innovation and it will drive a clear picture of how we go to market with our sales force. And then it finally leads value based healthcare, driving for outcomes, is the only way in which you are going to do it.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. You know another thing on spine, regarding surgical synergies. As you know the enabling technology platforms sit in what we historically call surgical technologies that component other is now in our brain business, so NAV and imaging. We actually go to a small surgical synergy team, which is a bridge between that business and our spine business and looking at our integrated technology roadmap by procedure as we move out and that also works for DBS as well.","So before we had two separate businesses that weren\u2019t linked quite close enough in my humble opinion to drive the surgical synergy benefit. So we put a small team and includes marketing as well as engineering talent to drive that integrated technology roadmap and that value proposition. So just in Q4 alone we had 50 new kind of combined capital equipment spine core metal deals, which is significantly more than we have had in the prior three quarters combined. And this is something that is a result of that and as we move forward, you will see the technology roadmap more integrated. So we have actually built a little bit of bridge between spine and our capital equipment business.","Kristen Stewart","So taking the structure that was successful with CVG in kind of overlaying that?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. Absolutely.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then just follow-up on diabetes. I saw today the announcement or if I guess it was maybe last week with Qualcomm with the Type-2 diabetes. Maybe if you could just expand a little bit more of that. It\u2019s just see more of the emphasis on Type-2 this seems to be kind of very early stage. When might the product like this kind of come out or just kind of how should we think about what I guess look for to next week?","Hooman Hakami","Yes, sure. Hi Kristen. Look, we continue to be excited about and focused on our Type-2 business. This is a new business unit that we put in place a little over a year ago. And we will talk you about the product roadmap next week at the Investor Day session, so you will get more insight there. But sufficed to say that our focus within Type-2 - first the Type-2 population is 90% of all patients with diabetes, so it\u2019s a huge market opportunity.","And when you take a look at those 90% of the patients, what we have decided to focus on is really monitoring those 90%. We could have gone the rout of insulin delivery, because that\u2019s also a core competency, but insulin and delivery within that Type-2 population only addresses about 10% of that 90%. The broader opportunity is within monitoring and what you see with Qualcomm Life, what you are seeing iPro 2 and our new Pattern Snapshot capabilities are really our efforts to bring more and more advanced monitoring solutions to those Type-2 patients.","And at the end, our goal isn\u2019t just to deliver a sensor to those patients or just the product, it\u2019s really to deliver an integrated solution to those patients where we bring not just a technology, but capability through analytics and insight that I can give those patients actionable information, so that they can better managed their disease. And also to do the same thing for physicians, who are managing those patients. So we are really excited about the opportunity. As you said, we are just getting started, but we think there is a tremendous amount of runway in this business.","Kristen Stewart","Thanks very much to you guys.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. It\u2019s time to close the call out here and I would like to remind that we plan to host our Investor Day next Monday June 6th in New York City. We look forward to having a more detailed discussions with you on our plans to deliver on these strategies that we outlined today. And I would also like to note that we anticipate holding our Q1 earnings call on Thursday August 25th.","And finally, in conclusion, as we have noted, we continue to focused on delivering consistent mid single-digit constant currency growth, strong EPS leverage and recurring a minimum of 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders. FY\u201916 was indeed successful and transformative year for our company and looking ahead, we feel we are well position to participate and lead in the transformation to value based healthcare, which can ultimately create long-term dependable value for our shareholders.","And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Thank you and all of you please have a great day. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Krystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our third quarter which ended on January 26, 2018. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.","During this earnings call, many of the statements made maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 and rates and ranges are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjust for our recent patient care, DVT and nutritional insufficiency divestiture as well as the impact of foreign currency. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported our third quarter financial results including revenue of $7.4 billion representing growth of 7%. Q3 non-GAAP operating profit grew 8% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.17 growing 12% and representing EPS leverage of 580 basis points.","These results effected solid quarter for Medtronic and as we expected a strong turnaround from the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to execute in our broad sustainable growth strategy driving therapy innovation and global market penetration while delivering enterprise synergies to enable margin improvement.","Each of our four groups delivered strong results with mid-single-digit revenue growth in MITG and RTG, high-single-digit growth in CVG and low teens growth in diabetes. Geographically, we also have a strong diversified performance with mid single-digits growth in the U.S. and non-U.S. developed markets and low double-digit growth in emerging markets.","At the same time, we completed our $850 million Covidien synergy commitments. We recently launched a new program Enterprsie Excellence designed to increase our effectiveness and enabled reinvestment for growth along with driving continued margin expansion and EPS leverage.","As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to deliver meaningful EPS leverage on mid-single-digit revenue growth this fiscal year, just as we have for the past five fiscal years. In therapy innovation, we are seeing a clear acceleration driven by several important new product launches across our four groups as well as our strong positions in the fastest growing therapies in MedTech.","Our Cardiac and Vascular Group grew 7% again this quarter delivering sustained growth by leveraging the breadth of its products and services, as well as its strong positions in important rapidly expanding markets. CVG is an impressive new product in infection control, diagnostics, transcatheter pacemakers, and AF Solutions generated combined growth in the mid 20s and now represent about a third of our Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure divisions.","Mid teens growth in our Coronary & Structural Heart divisions was led by the launch of our Resolute Onyx, drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and Japan as well as our high growth transcatheter valve business. In TAVR, we grew in the low 30s with mid 20s growth in the U.S. and low 40s growth in international markets driven by the strong global demand for Evolut PRO valve and expanded indications for use.","Our minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 6% driven by 7% growth in Surgical Innovations with strength in new products including our Signia powered surgical stapling system, our LigaSure vessel sealing instrument, and our Valleylab FT10 energy platform.","Respiratory, Gastrointestinal & Renal grew 3% driven by broad based growth in GI and Hepatology, strength in Nellcor pulse oximetry sensors given the high incidents of flu in the U.S. and strong adoption of our microstream capnography monitoring products. This offset the decline in our Airway and Ventilation business.","We are enthusiastic about the development of our Surgical Robotics platform, which we expect will strengthen our strategy of advancing minimally invasive procedures and we continue to make progress towards its launch. While we had intended first clinical use in humans in next couple of months, our final software and hardware integration and testing is taking longer than we initially expected.","This is not unusual with systems of this complexity. We are excited about the product performance that we already seen and intend to update timelines as we near the commercial launch. At our Investor Day in June, we intend to share incremental details of our system and update you on our progress.","As we mentioned before, the expectation of meaningful revenue from this system which will be depending on regulatory approval in developed markets. Regardless, we remained confident in our ability to grow MITG in the mid-single-digit next year and over the longer term.","Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 5% this quarter with robust growth in our Brain & Pain divisions. In Brain, the strength of our entire strong portfolio drove high teens growth in neurovascular and strong sales of our StealthStation navigation and O-arm imaging technologies led to low double-digit growth in neurosurgery.","In Pain, we are seeing very positive customer reaction from our Intellis platform and our evolved workflow driven, which together drove high single-digit growth reversing the declines we have seen for several quarters.","While our Spine division was flat this quarter, it was in line with the global spine market. Growth in BMP continue to offset declines in core spine, also when coupling our spine revenue with the spine enabling technologies that are reported in our neurosurgery business, our combined revenue grew over 1%. We believe this is a more relevant comparison of our spine results against our competition and an indication of our overall growth of Spine procedures.","We attribute this growth for the ongoing success of our surgical synergy strategy, which combines our enabling technologies such as imaging, navigation, powered instruments, nerve monitoring and Mazor Robotics with our spine implants to deliver integrated procedures.","Unexpected diabetes returned to double-digit growth this quarter driven by the continued adoption of our MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system in the U.S. We now have over 20,000 patients of our 670G system and we continue to receive highly positive feedback from the patients from this ground-breaking technology with real world results consistent with those reported in our pivotal study.","Our growth was further enhanced by the strong international demand for our 640G system. Our sensor attachment rates with all of our 6-Series systems globally remains strong and then as we continue to shift to our customer base from standalone funds to sensor augmented pumps, we expect sensors to be a key component of our growth.","Our efforts to increase our sensor capacity are progressing well. We are now able to meet the sensor demand of our existing customer base and remain on track to fully meet our predicted demand from both existing and new users in the fourth quarter. In addition, we benefited in the quarter from consumable revenue from legacy Animas users and the transition of Animas users to Medtronic continue to progress well.","We are also excited about the prospects of our standalone CGM system in Guardian Connect. Outside the U.S., we see strong utilization and retention of the patients from the system and with expected increase in our sensor manufacturing capacity; we are preparing to increase our customer base.","In the U.S., we have been closely collaborating with the FDA and expect to bring this innovative technology to market shortly. Guardian Connect features unique predictive alerts. And in the U.S., we utilized sugar IQ with the cognitive computing capability of IBM Watson to detect important patterns and trends for people with diabetes.","Turning now to our globalization growth strategy, emerging markets, which represent 15% of our revenue again, grew 12% in line with our long-term double-digit growth expectations. Our consistent emerging market performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification with strong balanced results around the globe.","Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa and China all grew double digits. In addition through investing in traditional market development, our differentiated strategies of participating in public and private partnerships as well as optimizing our distribution channels are driving our sustained performance.","The emerging markets represent the single largest opportunity in MedTech. Our remaining growth strategy economic value is a real accelerator for our therapy innovation and globalization strategies. We are pleased with our continued progress in creating new value based business models that directly linked our therapies to improving outcomes.","We now have over 1000 hospitals under contract and over 25% of our U.S. CRHF implantables\u2019 revenue is covered under a TYRX-related and value-based healthcare arrangements that linked total payment depletion and inflection outcomes.","Beyond TYRX, we have also commercialized five other value-based healthcare programs, covering various therapies including ICDs, CRTs, AF ablation, drug-coated balloons, and the aortic stent grafts, where a portion of our payment is tied to specific patient outcomes. Collectively, these five programs in addition to TYRX cover over $615 million in mostly U.S. based device revenue.","Across Medtronic, we remain focused on leading the ship to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improve patient outcomes of our volume. We are increasingly partnering with additional stakeholders and the healthcare value chain including payers, providers and other interested organizations to lead the change for FIFA service models to value-based programs.","It is our strong belief that Medtronic is uniquely positioned to leverage our global technical, clinical and disease - expertise to deliver better outcomes to the patients while improving efficiency for healthcare systems around the world and we are doing this in a way that we expect to benefit our shareholders as well.","With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar. As mentioned, our third quarter revenue of $7.369 billion represented a 1% increase as reported and growth of 7% on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for both foreign currency and a patient care DVT and nutritional insufficiency divestiture.","Foreign currency had a positive $177 million impact on third quarter revenue. GAAP diluted loss per share was a $1.03. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.17. After adjusting for the divestiture and a $0.01 negative impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 12%. The majority of our non-GAAP adjustments were driven by a $2.2 billion tax charge primarily related to the transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings as part of U.S. tax reform.","This tax will be paid over the next eight years with less of a cash impact in the first five years. Medtronic has been advocating for U.S. tax reform for many years and we are pleased with the final package included the ability to gain access to our future earnings outside the United States.","We now will have access to the vast majority of our cash flow and we expect to deploy with discipline in accordance with our capital allocation strategy of balancing reinvestments for future growth and providing meaningful returns for our shareholders.","The operating margin for the quarter was 28.8% on a comparable constant currency basis representing a year-over-year improvement of 30 basis points. This was primarily driven by a 40 basis points improvement in SG&A. As announced last month, we have reached our goal of delivering $850 million of synergies from the Covidien acquisition.","We also unveiled our enterprise excellence plan that is expected to deliver over $3 billion in annual growth run rate savings over the next five years. We expected to enable reinvestments for future growth as well as drive continued operating margin expansion and EPS leverage. Non-GAAP net other expense, which was included in our operating margin was $94 million versus $20 million on a comparable basis in the prior year. This change was driven primarily by increased expense related to our currency hedging program.","Foreign exchange in total had an approximate 90 basis point negative impact on our operating margin. This was more than expected given currency market volatility in the last month of the quarter, which resulted in the large foreign exchange impact on our inventory in late January as well as increased expense due to net balance sheet remeasurement on certain foreign currency denominated balances.","These were also the primary reasons for the mismatch between the FX benefit on our revenue and FX headwind on EPS. Our third quarter non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 15.6%. Based on our current estimates of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform.","We continue to expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be between 15% and 16%. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a non-GAAP diluted basis were 1.365 billion shares. As expected this was roughly flat sequentially and we expect our share count to remain roughly flat for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Combining our $1.6 billion of year-to-date share repurchase activity, with the $1.9 billion we paid in dividends over the same period, our total payout ratio was 76% on a non-GAAP net income.","Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to reiterate our annual revenue and EPS growth guidance. Unless specified, all of my guidance comments are comparable constant currency.","For the full fiscal year, we continue to expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9% to 10% from the prior year comparable of $4.37. For the fourth quarter, we would expect total Company revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%.","Looking at the expected fourth quarter revenue growth by our business groups. We expect CDG to deliver 4.5% to 5.5% growth, and MITG to grow in the range of 3% to 3.5% both driven by continued strengths of new products amidst more difficult fourth quarter comparisons. We expect RTG to grow in the range of 3% to 4% balancing the impact of a slower spine market with continued growth in pain therapies and strength in brain therapies.","Finally, in our Diabetes Group, as we have been forecasting for some time, we expect double-digit growth in the fourth quarter given increased sensor supply and the strength of the 670G launch in the United States.","With respect to earnings. We delivered strong EPS leverage in the third quarter, and we expect it to continue in the fourth with EPS growth of 11% to 13% of the prior year comparable of $1.25. While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast, if recent exchange rate remains stable for the fiscal year.","Our full-year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $480 million to $500 million, including an approximate $300 million to $320 million tailwind in the fourth quarter. Our full-year operating margin would be negatively affected by approximately 70 basis points, including approximately 150 basis points in the fourth quarter and our full-year EPS would be negatively affected by approximately $0.04 including a negative impact of approximately $0.02 in the fourth quarter.","Keep in mind the effective FX on revenue margin and EPS can differ due to the magnitude of the year-over-year change in expense related to our currency hedging program along with the timing difference of FX and cost-of-good sold reflecting inventory turns on our balance sheet.","While we intend to give our fiscal year 2019 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in May, the fiscal year 2019 commentary that I provided on last quarter's earnings call still stands. Also while we expect to continue to drive operating margin improvements and EPS leverage, keep in mind the following headwinds to our projected EPS growth.","We expect less interest income reflecting planned positioning of our investments for greater flexibility and liquidity in support of capital allocation. We will anniversary the full-year benefit from the accounting change on stock based compensation and we expect to begin to transition services related to our divestitures to Cardinal Health, eliminating the income in the back half of the fiscal year. Combined this could amount to a few 100 basis point headwind to EPS growth which we will be working to partially offset.","In addition, given recent changes to exchange rates, if current exchange rate remains stable through the next fiscal year we would now expect an approximately $500 million positive impact to fiscal year 2019 revenue and over $0.10 of benefit to EPS. Finally, I would like to note that we plan to hold our biannual Institutional Investor and Analyst Day on Tuesday June 5th in New York City.","Now I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Karen. And to conclude, Q3 was a solid quarter where innovation and technologies, strong positions in the fastest growing markets in MedTech and enterprise synergies produced solid returns.","We have driven a strong turnaround from our first half results and we remain confident in our ability to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and meaningful EPS leverage this fiscal year and beyond. We expect this to lead to robust free cash flow generations that we can deploy with discipline.","Finally, we remain keenly focused on executing to deliver dependable results for you our shareholders. As we continue to leverage our global diversification scale to fulfill our mission of elevating plain, restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world.","Let\u2019s now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I have asked to join us. We want try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions please contact Ryan and our investor relations team after the call.","With that operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Thanks for taking the question and appreciate it. A quick question for Karen and then for Omar. First Karen, just to start-off thank you for the preliminary thoughts you are providing on 2019 since I know I\u2019m going to get a lot of questions on it as I assume everybody else will. I just want to makes sure I hear exactly what you are saying.","My interpretation of what I just heard is that perhaps the FX benefit is roughly offsetting some of those incremental headwinds you talked about and that perhaps high single-digit earnings growth is a rough preliminary way to think about 2019. So is it fair to say that some of those headwinds you mentioned will be offset by FX and that roughly high single-digits is a good preliminary way to think about 2019 earnings?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, that\u2019s roughly in line Bob, at this stage we are still working on our annual planning process and we will give guidance on our fourth quarter call in May, but your summary is roughly right.","Robert Hopkins","Okay, thank you for that. And then, Omar I wanted to ask you about revenue growth, because obviously this is some of the best in those balance revenue growth. We have seen out of Medtronic for some time, so congratulations on that. I guess my question to be from a macro perspective, can you talk a little bit maybe about the drivers of the growth? How much of this was just particularly strong execution and new products versus strong markets. You know where there any significant one-time benefits in Q3, maybe just talk from a macro perspective about the revenue growth in the quarter and the sustainability?","Karen Parkhill","Well, like I have always mentioned our revenue performance is highly dependent on new product launch process and when we got new products, the revenue growth goes up quite significantly especially with respect to the market. Overall, the market normally really with major changes since before we expect what we said in November is about still holds the same in terms of surgical procedures and in terms of other procedures, some electric procedures and diabetes in particular have a ramp-up in December, which then tails down in January. So, these are all normal patterns.","I think the only thing that I will point out is of course that we are pleased with the diabetes business as promised and expected with the sense of shortage issue being addressed bows to double-digit growth, which clearly existed on its own helps. The other thing I'll point out actually is Pain division, where again we have been experiencing declines in growth and this quarter, we came up to high single-digits, which based on new product introductions.","So, those two are the outstanding drivers. I have encouraged CBG as usual performed and this was particularly good quarter with a variety of new products, which I detailed and MITG continued with their introduction of products. So really, product pipeline introduction is the main driver that we see in this performance and we are quite pleased with what we have seen.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Bob. Next question please, Krystal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Michael Weinstein","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of items to clarify. So, last quarter, Puerto Rico was about $60 million headwinds of the business. How much of that do you think you dropped back this quarter? And then second, I think we are probably all a bit surprised by the reduction in EPS guidance, because of FX this quarter. You commented on your prepared remarks that the fourth quarter will see a 150 basis point headwind to operating margins, because of the fact that that\u2019s pretty severe. So, can you just spend a minute on that and maybe just help me with what I guess one, why the FX impact hot worse by the weakening of the dollar from last call and two, why it\u2019s so severe on this fourth quarter? Thanks.","Karen Parkhill","Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. So on Puerto Rico, we did realize an incremental revenue from Hurricane Maria in the third quarter, but it was relatively minor. So the vast majority of the 7% growth in Q3 was related to improved underlying financial performance. In terms of foreign exchange, this quarter, given the significant volatility in foreign exchange rates, particularly in the last month of the quarter.","We did have an impact on our balance sheet from a remeasurement perspective of certain balances late in the quarter and then we also did have an impact to our inventory, which given inventory turns take some time to run through cost of goods sold. That said for fourth quarter, we do expect to have a continued foreign exchange headwind, both on margin and the bottom-line in the fourth quarter.","We expect in the fourth quarter on the bottom-line to have FX if rates remain stable to where they are today of a negative $0.02 for the fourth quarter while we do have a period right now, where a foreign exchange is benefiting revenue given the roll-off of our hedging program, we are seeing continued slight negative headwind to the bottom line.","Next year, with the strength of the dollar and the roll-off of most of our older hedges, we do expect a foreign currency benefit both on revenue and expense, and we mentioned at this stage, if rates remains stable for FY 2019, a positive impact on revenue up to $500 million and over $0.10 impact positively on EPS.","Michael Weinstein","Thanks, Karen. And maybe just one follow-up on cash flow. Karen, your guidance that seems to imply that you would do about $4.3 billion in free cash flow this year, and that\u2019s again going back to that FY 2016 base and then adjusting it for the divestiture. You have done $2.8 billion year-to-date is the expectation that you will get to that call it roughly $4.3 billion target? Thanks.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, thanks for the question. We do have a slide in our slide deck on cash flow and you will see, operating free cash flow year-to-date of $3.6 billion and yes, $2.8 adjusted that on a comparable basis $3 billion year-to-date. And the guidance still stands for the full fiscal year, where we expect to deliver high-single-digit growth on multiyear basis from 2016 to 2018, which would equate to approximately the cash flow forecast that you mentioned.","Michael Weinstein","Great. Thank you, Karen.","Karen Parkhill","Yes.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Mike. Can we get the next question, Krystal please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Great. Good morning. Just got two questions, one for Omar and one for Karen. Omar, I just want to come back to revenue and then some obviously very strong quarter here in the third. If I think that the top end of your guidance sort of implies your 5.5% for the fourth quarter, but also your commentary implies some deceleration and franchises like CVG and RTG. So, were there any one-time dynamics in the third quarter or pull forward, because of the hurricane dynamics or perhaps the fourth quarter reflects some type of conservatism?","Omar Ishrak","Well, I think the hurricane dynamics we rose were minor, but there was some applied, but clearly that was rose to the minor a bit on the overall base of our revenue. I think in Q4, it's mainly tougher comparisons year-over-year that are driving this in some areas like diabetes, we expect continued strength and I think CVGs had a strong high almost high single-digit growth rate over the past several quarters and we are running into a tougher comparison in Q4, so that's a lower that has been running.","But still we are in the mid-single-digits as we expect. I think with MITG what you saw in the Q4 was a slight enhancement, because of our sales and the pulse oximetry business because of the flu season, which was \u2013 and the requirement for that product was particularly high even given the historical levels. That's going to tail down in Q4, so that\u2019s dampening the growth a little bit. I think those are the key dynamics that I\u2019m looking at. It\u2019s still well in the mid-single-digit well in our guidance and we expect to close the year in the range that we had talked about in a fairly tough year.","David Lewis","Okay. So, continued momentum and the major changes across your key franchises sounds like in the fourth quarter.","Omar Ishrak","That's correct. Yes, it's just a quarter-over-quarter dynamics and some one-off issues here and there.","David Lewis","Okay. And then Karen, just as far as the next year\u2019s outlook, I\u2019d appreciate the comments you have provided. Just two sort of follow-up questions here. I would have great numbers, but it looks like underlying margin performance for fiscal 2018, it looks like it will comment somewhere around that 30 to 50 basis points range, perhaps 40 basis points of underline margins. How do you think that number trended into next year, can you do better than 30 to 40 basis points of underlying margin improvement, in fiscal 2019 is it possible at all to give us some range on the net change in hedging accounting into fiscal 2019 because that\u2019s sort of the big change on a relative basis? Thanks so much.","Karen Parkhill","Okay. Sure, thanks for the questions. In terms of margin benefit for FY 2018, you are correct, we did deliver on a constant currency basis 30 basis points of margin improvement this quarter and would expect that momentum to continue to drive full-year margin benefit to be higher than what we have this quarter.","In terms of net fiscal year, we do intend to continue to drive operating margin improvement and strong EPS leverage based on current exchanges rates where they are right now, you know we would expect a positive impact to the bottom line from FX and also not a headwind on margins. So it\u2019s been potentially positive benefit on margins too.","So we will obviously give our guidance on the fourth quarter earnings call, but I would expect continued positive momentum on margins from here. Particularly driven by our enterprise excellence program which we announced at the JP Morgan conference.","David Lewis","Great, thanks Karen, thanks Omar.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks David. Next quarter please Krystal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Kind of been a nice quarter to you guys. So maybe be my first one Omar and maybe Mike Coyle can add to that. Value based care this is something you have spoken - Omar. It just feels like you know we are getting more traction, you know we had some numbers on the revenue of rhythm management right where a lot of I think the street is concerned on this to compare your dynamics. You have a huge trial coming in, the Rapid Trial. Can you talk about how those value based contracts in particular in CRM, TYRX would change once you get the trial readout and could this possibly lead to more share gains and positive growth in that business in a few quarters?","Omar Ishrak","You know I know I have spoken a lot about value based healthcare, but I\u2019m particularly pleased to see this translate into real numbers which have real differentiating value for Medtronic and the person who read that actually is Mike Coyle in CVG and while TYRX is one example where innovation is linked directly to an outcome when we built a business model around it. We have actually got four, five other programs which are equally interesting, we are in the starting phases, but I will let Mike just comment overall on the subject then also onto the specific question on TYRX.","Michael Coyle","Sure, relative to TYRX, we are quite pleased with the level of uptick that we are seeing in with over 1000 hospitals now participating in the program where we actually have linkage back to essentially make a payment that will go to the account if the patient comes back with device related infection within six months.","And I think what that has been able to do is TYRX is not separately reimbursed and so by doing this we have been able to create a guarantee that basically is very appealing to accounts who know that they will obviously have a patient who is significantly impacted by an infection. They will lose money at the provider level, at the hospital level, because of that redo procedure that\u2019s required and of course the payer is now out two separate procedures for payments.","So this really is a win, win, win the way we have structured it and I think it\u2019s been seen that way by the accounts, but it also allowed us by being able to see the appeal of this approach to then apply it to numerous other parts of our business, including reductions in Heart Failure re-hospitalization with the adaptive CRT, a feature of our CRT devices.","Our Smart Shot Performance Guarantee program which basically pays when patients come back with inappropriate shots from an ICD, the drug-coated balloon reintervention prevention program which basically tie to patients coming back for target lesion reduced in SFA disease. And then in our cryoablation business, basically we have a program that pays when patients coming back with either repeat hospitalizations for AF, or for repeat procedures with the ablation.","And so collectively, these programs have now been rolled out really just been the last year since the TYRX program really got momentum in January a year ago and these newer programs are really only a quarter or two old, but as we mentioned in the script, we have over $650 million of revenue mostly in the U.S. tied to these programs and we continue to see opportunities to do more of them.","Vijay Kumar","Maybe one follow-up on cap allocation. Karen, you have access to $14 billion plus of cash and I think you mentioned for fiscal 2019 less interest income. So I\u2019m just curious wouldn\u2019t debt pay down offset some of that or can you just walk us with the mat on how that cash is going to be used and why should be an interest income headwind for next year?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. So yes, we do have $14 billion of cash on our balance sheet and we have access to the vast majority of that post Tax Reform. I think the biggest benefit to us will be the access to our ongoing cash generation though going forward, but with respect to the existing cash on the balance sheet, we have been paying down debt this year, we have another $2 billion of debt to mature in the fourth quarter this year, which we expect to let retire and we also have the Puerto Rico tax settlement still waiting out there.","It is under appeal, we have a hearing date set for mid March and so we are hopeful and feel strongly about our position there, but should the Appeals Court uphold the prior settlement, it does mean that we would have to pay a large tax settlement from that transaction. So the greatest benefit again is our access to our ongoing cash generation going forward.","Vijay Kumar","Thank you guys.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Vijay. Krystal, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two pretty straightforward questions I\u2019m asking both. Now Karen, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but the tax rate in fiscal 2019 are you assuming 100 to 200 basis points improvement over fiscal 2018, sorry if I missed that earlier on. And Omar, I was struck when I looked at the JP Morgan slide in January, few tuck-in M&A deals you have done in fiscal 2018 versus prior year. So I guess my question is why is that the case and any color you can provided on what we should expect going forward would be helpful. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay let me take the acquisition one first. A number of things, first of all we do acquisitions when we meet certain guidelines, that means where we think that the acquisition will add to our strategies which are very clear in the disease areas that we have got, especially tuck-in acquisitions in the disease areas that we have got presence in and it fills out our overall capabilities. We have got to have the management bandwidth and the financial bandwidth to do the deal and it is an interesting acquisition we do, then we haven\u2019t been shy from doing some reasonably big ones in the past two years.","I think the improved access to cash that we have with the new tax reform will actually help, open our financial bandwidth in doing some of these deals, but remember they all go together. There is financial bandwidth. There is management bandwidth. There is most importantly the strategic alignment of the tuck-in acquisition and our ability to integrate it properly with the right team. And I wouldn\u2019t read too much into any particular year, it is really overall, we have created a pretty good track record of doing these and we intend to continue.","Karen Parkhill","And Larry on the tax rate question, our initial estimates indicated that we would benefit from a slightly lower effective tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2019. We did not have the basis points improvement, but we did say we expect it to be slightly lower. We continue to work through the complexity of the new reform and additional guidelines that come out from an U.S. treasury to refine our estimates and certainly, if in that process, our initial estimates change, we will certainly let you know, but at this stage, we expect a slightly lower effective tax rate.","Lawrence Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Larry. Krystal, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back on the comments on the robotics platform. I was just wondering if you could expand upon any other comments that you made earlier, just going on what exactly are some of the delays there?","Omar Ishrak","Like I said Kristen, that\u2019s a fairly complicated system with multiple computers being put together and it\u2019s the event that we have had some experience with, and when you integrate a system of this level of complexity, there may be some time line shifts as to when will be ready for first-inhuman use and so it\u2019s taken just a little longer than we thought earlier.","We are very excited about what we are seeing, I mean we have seen the thing operate and the performance is very compelling. I think it\u2019s best if we wait till Investor Day when we will give you some more insights as to the nature of this product, which we are really excited about and also as we get closer to commercial launch, we will give you some dates.","So I think that\u2019s the best way to look at it. It makes no mistake this product is an outstanding product and the sorts of integration hiccups you get are not uncommon at all with systems of this magnitude and one that we know will get through, and we will be ready for the launch of the suitable type.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. But you said do you still expect first-inhuman use to the event?","Omar Ishrak","No. Look we are not at a stage to give you dates like that, but once we wait till Investor Day and then we will give you an update on our overall performance and really, we will stick to timelines when we are close to commercial launch.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then just a question on diabetes franchise, can you give an update on the continued growth monitor?","Michael Coyle","Hi, Kristen. The central ramp-up is actually progressing well. It was a key contributor to our growth rate in Q3. Just to maybe put some additional color on it, our guidance since its reproduction in the third quarter was twice as high as what we experienced in the second quarter.","So that should give you an indication of how things are progressing and as the commentary alluded to, we are on track to fulfill all the sensor needs of our install base this quarter and by the end of this quarter, we will be able to meet unconstrained demand as we have been staying all the long.","Now the other thing I will just point out is the performance of the sensor itself not just capacity, but as Omar talked about in the commentary, the MARDs that we are seeing on over 20,000 patients in the install base is fantastic and continues to really essentially marrow what we saw in the pivotal trial. So, we are very pleased not just in terms of the output, but also the quality of the sensor.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Perfect. Just timing in the U.S.?","Michael Coyle","For the Guardian Connect standalone?","Kristen Stewart","Yes.","Michael Coyle","Yes. That one is with the FDA. Kristen, we are very confident that we are going to be able to get this out shortly. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly when the FDA is going to approve it, but we are working very closely with them and all indications are that we will have an approval here in short order.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Thanks very much everyone.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Kristen. Take next question please, Krystal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Good morning guys. Thank you. Kristen, a question for you on the $3 billion growth cost savings goal that you guys have said. If I look correctly, the FY 2018 was the base here and so now that you guys are most the way to year one, could you give us a sense of what net savings have been today just so can triangulate how that translating into margins overtime?","Karen Parkhill","Sure, Isaac. On the $3 billion gross savings, we do expect annually incrementally between $500 million to $700 million each year over the five-year period. So next year, you can expect that incremental savings, not all of that will follow to the bottom-line, because we will be focused on using some of it to offset pricing pressure and to reinvest, but it is this program that will drive that strong margin improvement and EPS leverage that we have talked about. Go ahead.","Isaac Ro","No, I\u2019m sorry. You were speaking.","Karen Parkhill","In terms of the $500 million to $700 million annual incremental each year, expect it to be more in the lower half of that range in the beginning years and more in the upper half of that range in the later years.","Isaac Ro","Okay. And so when we get to let\u2019s say next Investor Meeting or thereabout, would you start talking about net savings that you expect out of this program either a cumulative or on an annual basis?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. We will be talking about every year when we give annual guidance, the net savings as we see impact that we would expect to see from a top to a bottom-line.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Isaac. Krystal, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So I wanted to follow up on two points that you just put a final point on two areas that you have already touched on. One is, it is encouraging to see the diabetes turn around and you talked getting to a point where you are now meeting demand. I guess could you help us sequentially understand from here how much improvement you could see in terms of your ability to grow beyond that and actually go after new customers and maybe just touch on it a little bit more detail, the enema has changed and how that could help your pump as you said you are the preferred provider?","Omar Ishrak","Sure, Matt. When we say by the end of this quarter, we will be able to meet on constraint demand that\u2019s not only talking about pump users and our ability to satisfy the sensor needs of those patients who are on pumps.","It\u2019s also about our ability to go after new markets like standalone sensors which I had talked about with Guardian Sensor 3 three and the pending approval in the United States. So we really feel confident that by the end of this fiscal year we will be in a position to really go after our existing market as well as start to really penetrate aggressively new markets that we currently don\u2019t plan.","That\u2019s number one, as far as Animas goes I would say that\u2019s progressing very well, we are generating today consumable revenue from that transaction and we are transitioning patients that are out of warranty from Animas to Medtronic as planned and things are going very well with that and we are getting some incremental growth out of that and the way I would characterize it is even - if we exclude Animas we would have been double digits in Q3, but we are very pleased with how that\u2019s going and we look forward to just continuing the transition.","Matthew Taylor","Thanks and then just a follow-up maybe for Mike Coyle or anybody else who want to jump in on CVG. So are really encouraged by the growth this quarter in the mid single-digit expectations going forward. Could you just touch on specifically whether you are seeing competition from the recent MRI labels of your key competitors and how you are able to offset that and talk about TYRX but any kind of further color in that one pain point result?","Michael Coyle","Yes, obviously we play in a lot of statements and we see various momentum coming from all new product launches and competitive new product launches and you know we are seeing at the margin some share loss in the initial implants in the ICD segment just as MRI has come in for the both competitors and they are basically going to their user friendly accounts and getting some of that share back.","Of course on the flip side we are taking share in the - segment of the market because if not only Micra but also because of the CRT-P quadripolar product as well as the strong position we have now with our next generation wireless facing pacing that just entered the U.S. market. And obviously you also saw we are taking market share in both the coronary and [indiscernible] segments.","So basically when you net it all together, we are really just taking advantage of the size and scale that we had as an organization for diversified growth and we think we can continue to deliver above the market growth and our segment market growth is between 4.5% and 5% typically. So that 4.5% to 5% we are talking about next quarter really is just a function of a very strong Q4 a year ago and then we expect to be able to continue or participate across our broad portfolios that is above market growth.","Matthew Taylor","Thanks Mike.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Matt. We will take the next question please Krystal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners.","Danielle Antalffy","Thanks so much. Good morning guys thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really strong quarter. Omar I was wondering if you could talk about new product contribution to growth in the quarter, obviously new products are a key part of this and also how we should think about the contribution of the new product growth factor in fiscal 2019, not asking you to give guidance, but it just seems like that\u2019s going to become an increasingly important part of the growth story.","Omar Ishrak","Yes, I think first of all I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me, but that is a major component of the growth in this last quarter and it will be going forward and the Company is really based around therapy innovation, so that\u2019s not surprising.","I do want to point out clearly that our value-based healthcare programs are economic value programs that are all accelerators for our new products and we realized that the connection of technology to demonstrating clear outcome improvement is the way to get value for these products even in the current fee for service environment and to get differentiated pricing for these products, because of the credible promise and commitment to improve the outcome which our customers see.","So you will see an increasing drive towards newer and newer therapies, but the linkage to the outcome and the value that that creates is what will give us our differentiated strategy and then over time of course these products then go into emerging markets and drive further acceptance in those markets in penetration, but the new products in our business are the fundamental sort of value that we have and the linkage to outcome as what the value is to our customers and an ability to join these two together as we are successfully able to do now will differentiate us, will give us momentum.","Danielle Antalffy","Great. And just one quick follow-up to that given the importance of new products, can you talk about the gross margin profile of these new products sort of overall is it in line with about corporate average is that the right way to think of new products generally?","Omar Ishrak","I think the new products yes, in general, I mean sometimes they are so attractive in the market when we make a tradeoff with pricing volume, but in general you know with the new feature, the new value and the price is justified by the value that the customers and the objectives we realize. And so this is not an arbitrary thing that the value we get the price and in general you see that and you will see the offset of older products overtime. So overall pricing surf numbers that we put previously I think will takes us hold and our ability to maintain them depends on these new products.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay. Thank you so much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Danielle. Next question please, Krystal.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO.","Joanne Wuensch","Thanks for taking the question. Very nice revenue growth this quarter. Can we talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the TAVR market, you had you indicated your opening up new centers and is there anything specific that we should look for at ACC?","Michael Coyle","Yes, I think the market dynamics have remained very strong there in terms of overall market growth in the low 20s on a constant currency basis and that\u2019s pretty well balanced across the U.S. and international.","We obviously have been in share capture mode here over the last couple of quarters based on really the performance of the Evolut PRO product, which has being extremely well received in terms of its lowering leak rates, lowering pacemaker rates and so it\u2019s really being received as an excellent product.","But also obviously the expand indications for use into intermediate risk and of course we continue with enrollment in the low risk patient population and of course we have entered the Japan obviously with the Evolut product as well.","So all of those collectively are helping us drive above market growth in the overall market. There is nothing particularly new at ACC coming in terms of - really just additional data in some of our larger registries and studies, which obviously continue to support the performance of the products and especially Evolut PRO. So you will see those at ACC.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you and as a follow-up question. Your Resolute Onyx is gaining fair momentum this quarter, is there anything qualitatively you can share with us as a positive being rolled out? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Yes. What we think that is one of our customers tell us it\u2019s probably the best handling stent in the marketplace in terms of high visibility, is there a good visibility, it\u2019s got a great deliverability. We also expanded the size metrics and have actually some unique sizes that other companies don\u2019t have.","And the other thing it does for us is in conjunction with resolute integrity, which is also a very well performing product gives us a little more balance in terms of how we can provide multiple price points into the market to deal with pricing pressures.","And so collectively, those things have really allowed us to both stabilize pricing and to drive market share capture across that segment and of course, it\u2019s still a very large product segment and highly profitable, so we are glad to see the growth that we are getting out of the product in both the U.S. and in Japan.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Joanne. Krystal, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Navarro","Hi. Good morning. Two questions on spine. First, it looks like the Spine market had another challenging quarter, do you guys have any incremental insights anything you may have regarding the challenges that are facing the market, anything new you may have picked up in the last three months and then as a follow-up ticking with Spine, I\u2019m wondering how much has the major robot helped drive your business and has it helped pull through any incremental hardware and biologic sales? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Glenn, on the market, I have no new insights from the last quarter, I mean the formula that we had been seeing in call it FY 2017 and even in Q1 FY 2018 is more of a kind of 5% procedural growth with maybe 3% price reductions for a net 2% growth on a global basis.","And that formula has come down to maybe a 2%, 3% procedure growth of 2% or 3% price decline to get you basically flat and that\u2019s what we have been seeing over the last couple of quarters. We do think that\u2019s going to go up from here to a point of net growth or so over the next couple of quarters is what we are seeing, but no new insights in terms of what is driving that. I mean there is definitely a more pricing.","I think there is another point of pricing pressure in here and with hospitals consolidating, getting more sophisticated in their buying patterns and they are tendering and they are consolidating their vendor base and for us, its tail 2 cities, one given our product preps and implants plus our enabling technology we end up usually a net benefactor when you consolidate vendors, but it is resulting in some price declines. So that\u2019s what we are gaining from share.","In terms of Mazor, it is starting I mean the distribution relationship is relatively new and it is starting to pull through revenue. There is too tangible. We haven\u2019t seen the benefit of it yet, we will see it in the coming quarters. There is two tangible way that pulls through revenue, one is when we have placed a few sorts of equipments and that accounts in return for incremental spine shares. So in the last two quarters, we have started doing that with Mazor and that it lags maybe six months before those contracts take effect and we actually see that incremental revenue.","So we haven\u2019t seen it yet, but it\u2019s locked in if you will. And then going forward around the December or January timeframe, we will have Mazor integrated into our broader spine enabling technology. So, it\u2019s fully integrated with navigation and operative imaging or O-arm and in that case, the advanced features of that platform will only work with Medtronic implant.","So, it will be a technology type in with the platform that will further pull through. So, it is starting to drive the revenue, you don\u2019t see in our economic shift, but it will be coming in the coming quarters and those are the two reasons why.","Glenn Navarro","Geoff, just one clarification. Did you say going forward, your thought procedure volume would improve, offset by maybe slightly greater pricing pressure so net-net no change in the market going forward on the quarter basis?","Geoffrey Martha","It\u2019s hard to project us as we are looking at net-net anywhere from no change to maybe 100 basis points improvement on net.","Glenn Navarro","Okay, great. Thank you, Geoff.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Glenn. Now, we will take one more question please, Krystal.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Josh Jennings","Good morning. Thank you. I was hoping to follow up Omar, on your comment on your economic value creation strategy. Historically, you have talked about 40 to 60 basis points of organic growth contribution coming from the services and solution business. I\u2019m wondering if you could update your thoughts that should we still be considering the annuity revenue growth from hospital solutions, some of your peer services business like Cardiocom as well as the value-based programs driving 40 to 60 basis points, organic growth or should we thinking more about the implant benefit with some of those programs driving growth more on the implant side going forward? And I have one follow-up.","Omar Ishrak","Sure, look I think both. We haven\u2019t been able to hit the 40 to 60 basis points. We talked about it as a target closer to the 20 to 40 I\u2019d say and our growth in hospital solutions continues and we had actually a particularly strong quarter with the VA in our care management services business. So, I mean those have done an easy revenue actually continues to grow. We are increasing the number of hospitals.","We are pretty excited about the spread of contracts that we are getting in hospitals around the world now in Latin America and in the Middle East as well as in Western Europe to our hospital solutions and that\u2019s increased from our cath lab managed services or operating managed services as well. So, there is a strong focus in the company around that and that will deliver increased annuity revenue.","I think though what we found is that the bigger benefit and that\u2019s the value, but the bigger benefit actually is the linkage with our new therapies, which is then driving incremental share in our new therapies and incremental pricing in some situation, where the innovation and value are directly linked.","And so that\u2019s why we started to look at this in a much more integrated fashion and the contribution we can only value actually to our innovation program is greater than the annuity revenue although I\u2019m not, by any means, saying we are going away from that in any way.","Josh Jennings","Thanks for that and just a follow-up, one of the drivers behind the response of acquisition hip and knee offering was your services business and the opportunity there. Any change if you can give us an update just on the performance of your hip and knee offering relative to internal expectations and the updated thoughts on the Medtronic\u2019s drive to add breadth and scale to the orthopedic unit? Thanks a lot.","Omar Ishrak","I think we are still in the early phases of that and I\u2019m going to ask Geoff to kind of comment on risk management.","Geoffrey Martha","Yes, sure. As Omar said, I mean we are coming into the ortho market; we want to come in a disruptive way both from a device standpoint and from the services standpoint. And so we remained really encouraged about the opportunity, but it is taking a little longer than we thought, we are still working on this and we are getting good engagement from customers both on the device side.","Our knee is out there and we are seeing operate it on a number of centers and you know we have had 50 or so patients that has been implanted in, but again we are continuing to tweak the instrument design on that to get it exactly where we want it, and the hip is from an FDA approval standpoint several quarters out.","So we are continuing work on that and be encouraged by the demand for this value proposition on the device side and on the servicer side this is more of a care pathway offering, also very encouraged by the customers we have engaged with. You know several hospitals and also some outpatient surgery centers.","Again not ready to fully ramp this, because that takes in investment of capital that until we get the exact formula right to be disruptive and scale this in a profitable way we are not going to ramp it. So we are still working on this and will update you in the future on this.","Joshua Jennings","Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Josh.","Omar Ishrak","Okay.

And welcome to the Medtronic Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] ","I would like to hand the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President-Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's fiscal year 2020 second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our second quarter, which ended on October 25th, 2019. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.","During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","For this call, unless we say otherwise, rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis, which compares to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 after adjusting for foreign currency. References to organic revenue growth, exclude the impact of our Titan Spine acquisition and currency.","Reconciliations of all non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the attachement to our earnings press release or on our website at investorrelations.medtronic.com. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported another quarter of solid results with organic revenue growth and EPS both coming in ahead of Street expectations, reflecting our continued focus on executing to our commitments across Medtronic.","Q2 revenue grew 4.3% in constant currency and 4.1% organic, and acceleration from the first quarter with outperformance in RTG, MITG and diabetes.","We also delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in emerging markets. Our adjusted operating margin expanded approximately 20 basis points, in line with expectations and included key investments ahead of several major new product launches. Our enterprise excellence initiatives where we leverage our size and scale to improve our effectiveness and efficiency continue to benefit our P&L, particularly on the SG&A line.","On the bottom line, our diluted EPS grew 7.4% or 9% at constant currency, despite the headwind and EPS growth from the increase in our non-GAAP nominal tax rate. Overall, our broad-based performance this quarter demonstrates the consistency of our execution, the strength of our innovation, and the benefit of our business and geographic diversification.","Let's take a look now at the drivers of our quarterly performance, starting with our Restorative Therapies Group. RTG delivered a particularly impressive performance, posting 6% organic growth, which was 150 basis points ahead of our expectations. Strong sales in spine and brain therapies more than offset slower growth in pain therapies. Our surgical synergy strategy for spine surgery, which combines the enabling capital equipment in our Brain Therapies division with the implant in our Spine division is having an exceptional and sustained impact on RTG\u2019s growth.","Our Spine division grew 5.5% organic in the U.S. and 3.5% organic globally. This excludes the early contribution from our Titan Spine acquisition, which is off to a good start. Organic revenue growth in spine hit its highest level in 2.5 years with strong double-digit growth in infused bone graft sales as well as 3% organic Core Spine growth both globally and in the U.S. This was driven by our surgical synergy strategy, where surgeon use of our capital equipment in particular our Mazor robot is resulting in increased sales of our Core Spine implants","In fact, when you combine our spine division sales, with the sales of our capital equipment from our Brain Therapies division that are used in spine surgery, which is how our spine competitors report results our Spine division grew a robust 6.7% organic with our U.S. spine business growing 7.7% organic, well above the market.","As I just mentioned, our surgical synergy strategy is also benefiting our Brain Therapies division, which sells the capital equipment used in spine surgery. Brain Therapies delivered another above-market quarter of 11.3% growth.","In neurosurgery, we had double-digit growth at all three of our offerings, Robotics, Navigation and Imaging. Our Midas Rex powered surgical instruments also grew double-digits, as we fully launched the new Midas Rex's MR8 system in the U.S. during the quarter.","In Brian Therapies, our market-leading neurovascular business also had a very strong quarter with high-teens growth reflecting strength in both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Our ischemic stroke business grew in the high twenties and strong adoption of our Solitaire X stent retriever, Riptide aspiration system and React catheters.","In Hemorrhagic stroke, we grew low double-digits, as expanded indications of our Pipeline Flex for diversion system continued to drive growth. This was Geoff Martha\u2019s last quarter leading RTG, before taking over as President of Medtronic earlier this month.","Over his four-year tenure, Geoff revitalized the group. He implemented a strong strategy, built a robust management team and invested in an innovative pipeline. It is also noteworthy that he named a successor from within RTG.","Brett Wall has done an outstanding job, leading our Brain Therapies division, and he has played a vital role in the turnaround of RTG. We look forward to his leadership of the group. In the Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, we had another very strong quarter, growing 6.1% and ahead of expectations, driven by very good performances in both surgical innovations and RGR.","In Surgical innovations, we grew mid-single-digits in both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy. Advanced Stapling growth was driven by new products in our Tri-Staple line, including our EEA circular stapler and Tri-Staple 2.0 re-loads.","Advanced Energy growth benefited from continuous innovation in our LigaSure Franchise, including our LigaSure Exact Dissector.","Respiratory GI and Renal delivered another exceptional quarter growing 6.1%. The GI Solutions business grew high single-digits led by strong sales of Bravo calibration-free reflux system, EndoFLIP imaging systems and PillCam systems.","Respiratory and patient monitoring also grew high-single-digits, on strengthening Nellcor Pulse Oximetry, Microstream capnography, and BIS brain monitoring consumables, Puritan Bennett 980 ventilators and McGRATH video laryngoscopes.","In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, we grew 1.3% this quarter, which was in line with our expectations. CVG has gone through a series of below-trend quarters, which we believe are coming to an end. CVG\u2019s growth this quarter reflects the challenges of the last few quarters in LVADs and DCBs as well as the sustained headwind in CRM replacement devices, given the longer-life batteries we launched several years ago.","In addition, during the quarter, we implemented a number of changes to our manufacturing processes for our direct product line which temporarily limited supply and affected our revenue growth in CRHF high-power.","We're seeing clear signs of overcoming these headwinds. U.S. DCBs and LVADs both grew in the teens quarter-over-quarter. We have now passed the one-year anniversary of the step-down in LVADs, and we expect to anniversary the DCB challenges in March.","With our CRM replacement devices, both pacemakers and CRT-D replacement -- grew sequentially for the first time in several years. We expect CRM replacement devices to be a net neutral impact to CRHF growth next fiscal year after several years of being a headwind to growth.","Regarding TYRX, we launched our new manufacturing process late last month and expect production volumes in Q3 to return to normal levels. Despite these areas of pressure on CVG growth, we're seeing strong performance in other CVG businesses, including Pacing and TAVR, which combined; represent over 25% of CVG revenue. Our Pacing business grew mid-single digits globally and high single-digits in the U.S. as our Micra Single Chamber Transcatheter Pacing System continues to take share and expand the market.","Beyond Micra, our global pacemaker share is benefiting from unique feature differentiation in our conventional pacemakers, including our Reactive ATP feature, which resulted in differential reimbursement in Japan, as well as the increasing popularity of HIS bundle and left bundle branch pacing, where Medtronic offers unique lead and lead delivery products that enable such procedures.","In our TAVR business, we grew in the low 20s, but mid-20s growth in the U.S. Driven by expansion into the low-risk patient population, we launched our Evolut PRO+ TAVR system in the U.S. late in the quarter. And this drove some of the highest procedural implant volumes that we've ever had in the final two weeks of the quarter.","We see an accelerating growth profile for CVG over the back half of our fiscal year, with the anniversary of the LVAD challenges, improving sequential growth in DCBs, improvements in pacemaker and CRT-D replacement volumes, and the benefit of multiple, important new product launches.","In diabetes, we grew 4.3% slightly ahead of our expectations. Our U.S. business declined in the high single-digits, which is anticipated and resulted from competitive challenges, while we await our new products.","At the same time our international business, which represents just under half of our diabetes revenue grew 19%. The MiniMed 670G which drove strong growth in the U.S. last year is experiencing that same strong consumer demand as we've launched and received reimbursement in select international markets. This demand is not only driving double-digit growth in insulin pumps, but it is also resulting in double-digit growth in recurring revenue from CGM and other consumables.","Late last month, we announced our Sean Salmon who has successfully led our Coronary & Structural Heart division is taking over leadership of the Diabetes Group. Sean has an excellent track record in developing and executing competitive business strategies, including the successful launches of several important new technologies for Medtronic. Sean is actively engaged, and we look forward to the impact that he will make on the business.","Now, turning to emerging markets, which represent 16% of our revenue. In Q2, we grew emerging markets 12% with contributions from geographies around the globe. China grew 13% South Asia grew 14%, as with Eastern Europe which included 20% growth in Russia. In addition, Southeast Asia grew 12%, the Middle East and Africa 10%, and Latin America 9%.","We continue to drive strong growth in these markets as we optimize the distribution channel and uncertain markets, localized R&D and manufacturing. In addition, the diversified growth in markets around the world is important. We believe the geographic breadth of our business and the rapid expansion of healthcare across these markets typically insulates us from country-specific economic cycles. As a result, we expect continued and consistent double-digit growth in emerging markets.","The first half of this fiscal year has gone well, as we've executed to our commitments and delivered better-than-expected results. Now as we look forward, we're even more excited about what lies ahead. As investments we've made in our pipeline begin to pay off by accelerating our revenue growth and creating value for our shareholders.","And CVG as I mentioned earlier, we just launched our next-generation Evolut PRO+ TAVR valve. And we expect to see a full quarter's contribution starting in Q3. In addition, we're expecting imminent U.S. approval for our IN.PACT Admiral AV fistula indication.","As we look to the fourth quarter, and into the start of fiscal 2021, we're anticipating U.S. approval and launch of our Micra AV pacemaker, our next-generation Cobalt and Chrome families of ICDs and CRT-Ds, and our Reveal LINQ 2.0 Insertable Cardiac Monitor.","Outside the U.S., we are also expecting multiple new product introductions, including the European launch of our DiamondTemp ablation catheter and Japanese approvals for our Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft, our preceptor [ph] Quad CRT-P family and Attain Stability Quad Active-fixation CRT-P lead.","At MITG, as we discussed in September during our event in Hartford, we're starting the global launch sequence of our soft tissue robotic system with first-in-human use in commercial sales commencing later this fiscal year. Next fiscal year, we plan to submit for CE Mark in Q1 as well as submit for U.S. IDE approval in the first half, which when approved, will allow for system placements and surgeon training, so we can begin gathering clinical data in the United States.","In RTG, as I mentioned earlier, the Midas Rex MRA drill platform is being launched now in the U.S. and will be introduced to international markets in the back-half of this fiscal year. We're also planning to launch our Stealth Autoguide, cranial robotic system in Q3.","In Pelvic Health, we filed our PMA supplement with the U.S. FDA last month for InterStim SureScan MRI leads and our interest in Micra with MRI, which is 3CC in volume and rechargeable.","In ENT, we're preparing for a fiscal year-end launch of our next-generation intraoperative nerve monitoring system NIM Vital.","In Pain Therapies, we plan to unveil our next-generation Spinal Cord Stimulator at the NANS Conference in January. In Diabetes, we continue to prepare for the launch of the MiniMed 780G, our advanced hybrid closed loop system with Bluetooth connectivity. We expect our 780G pivotal data to be presented at the ATTD Conference in February.","Earlier this month, to bridge the time before our next-generation technology is available in the U.S. we\u2019ve put in place a next-tech pathway program which allows customers who are out of warranty or new-to-pump therapy to purchase a MiniMed 670G while accessing our next-generation pump technology at no additional cost when it becomes available.","These are some of the highlights from our pipeline. There are course several more product launches that we're preparing for across the company. While we continue to invest in building out a robust long-term pipeline of continuous innovation, invention, and disruption.","As I've noted before, we expect our growth rate to accelerate with the second half of FY 20 growing faster than the first, as we anniversary recent headwinds, and launch multiple new products.","And in FY 2021, we expect our top-line momentum to accelerate. As we get the increasing benefit of the FY 2020 product launches as well as a product slated to launch next fiscal year.","With that, let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our second quarter financials. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you. As Omar mentioned, we delivered second quarter organic revenue growth of 4.1% and adjusted EPS was $1.31 growing 7.4%. We came in $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by our operational outperformance.","Our adjusted operating margin was 28.1% reflecting improvement of approximately 20 basis points. We delivered strong improvement in adjusted SG&A of approximately 90 basis points, as we implement and drive efficiencies and improvements across the company under our Enterprise Excellence program.","Our improvement in SG&A was offset by declines in gross margin reflecting the negative impact of foreign currency and China tariff. Below the operating profit line our adjusted interest expense declined 32%, driven by our successful debt issuance and tender transactions earlier this calendar year.","As you know, our cost of debt reduction is helping to offset an increase in our annual tax rate from U.S. tax reform. Generating strong free cash flow remains a priority across the company.","Second quarter free cash flow was $1.6 billion, up 66% from last year. We are tracking nicely towards our full-year conversion ratio target of 80% plus. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing investment in R&D and tuck-in acquisitions to drive future growth, with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders.","In the second quarter, we returned over $1.1 billion or 71% of the cash we generated, resulting in a total shareholder payout of 64% on adjusted net earnings.","Before I turn the call back to Omar, I would like to update our annual revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the year, we continue to expect organic revenue growth to approximately 4%, with revenue growth accelerating in the back half relative to the first.","While the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full-year revenue growth of approximately 80 basis point to 120 basis points.","With the strength we're seeing across several of our businesses, from neurosurgery and neurovascular, to spine surgical innovations and TAVR, we are raising the organic growth guidance for our three largest business groups. We now expect CVG to grow 2.5% to 3% up from 2.5%.","MITG to grow 5% to 5.5% up from 5%, and RTG to grow 4.5% to 5% up from 4% to 4.5% previously. These three groups combined contribute 92% of our revenue. In diabetes, which represents 8% of our sales, we now expect low single-digit organic growth, reflecting competitive pressures in the U.S. while we await new product approval.","For the third quarter, we anticipate organic revenue growth of 4% plus with currency having a negative impact of 50 basis points to a 120 basis points at recent rates. By group, we expect CVG to accelerate to 3.5% to 4%, diabetes to be flat to slightly down and MITG and RTG to grow 4.5% to 5% all, on an organic basis.","As Omar mentioned, we are anticipating either U.S. or European approval on a long list of products, starting in the fourth quarter and building into the early part of next year. Our Micra AV Transcatheter pacemaker Precept [ph] PC Deep Brain Stimulator. InterStim micro 3CC sacral nerve stimulator.","MiniMed 780G advanced hybrid closed loop, DiamondTemp RF ablation catheter and AV fistula indication for our IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon. And next-generation for our Intellis SCS system, LINQ 2.0 Insertable Cardiac Monitor in Cobalt and Chrome family ICD and CRT-D. I'm sure, I left some off here. But as you can see, we have a lot of that's coming, which is why we expect fourth-quarter growth to accelerate as we begin to see the early impact of some of these launches.","Turning to margins, we continue to expect our full-year operating margin to expand by roughly 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our enterprise excellence initiatives. For the third quarter, we would expect slight improvement in operating margin, offset by a currency headwind.","Below the operating line, we expect our quarterly non-GAAP interest expense to be similar to the second quarter for the remainder of the year. In addition, we now expect our third quarter adjusted nominal tax rate to be in the range of 15 to 15 and a quarter, and an annual range of 15 to 15.5.","We remained focused on optimizing our underlying operating tax rate overtime. We are raising our fiscal year 2020 EPS guidance to a range of $557 million to $563 million to reflect the second quarter's outperformance, a $0.03 increase from the prior range of $554 million to $560 million. This includes a negative $0.09 impact of currency at recent rates.","For the third quarter, we expect EPS of $1.37 to $1.39 including a $0.02 currency headwind at recent rates.","Now, I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks. Karen. As I mentioned earlier, Geoff Martha became President of Medtronic earlier this month. And at the start of the next fiscal year, I will retire as CEO, and Geoff will take my place. I'm excited with the Board selection of Geoff as the next leader of Medtronic. Geoff has proven itself as a leader who can execute and deliver strong financial performance, develop our people and enhance our company's culture.","I know he will take Medtronic to new levels of performance and growth. We're working together closely to ensure a very smooth transition. Before we go to the Q&A, I've asked Geoff to say a few words. Geoff?","Geoffrey Martha","Thanks, Omar. While first, I want to reiterate what an honor it is to have been selected by the Board as Medtronic's next CEO. And I'm really looking forward to leading this great company. Now looking at this past quarter's results, I'm particularly pleased to see our strategies are working in spine with strong growth in that business, driven by enabling technology like our Mazor robot.","And the transition with Brett as the head of RTG has been incredibly smooth. While he officially took over earlier this month, Brett really lead the execution down the stretch in Q2 for RTG. Look, RTG is in good hands, I\u2019ll just say that.","Now as I look ahead, I\u2019m incredibly excited about Medtronic's future. We have several product launches coming up, and you could be assured that executing on these is top of my list of priorities. Actually, the entire Medtronic leadership team is focused and committed to delivering on our pipeline, allowing us to build momentum as we head in the back half of the fiscal year and into the next. Also during this transition period, I'm connecting with many important Medtronic stakeholders, and thinking about how our strategy will evolve and how we will achieve that next level of performance.","For starters, I\u2019m spending a lot of time meeting with our business leadership and customers beyond RTG. I also plan to meet with and listen to the investment community over the coming months. The transition with Omar is going great. We've worked together for a long time, and we know how to build off each other's strength.","Additionally, I am thrilled with the support from the Board and my colleagues on the executive committee. Having continuity and a transition like this, makes life a lot easier. While it's still too early to comment on specifics on how our strategy will evolve, I'd like to share a few initial thoughts. First, one thing that won't change is our focus on the Medtronic mission, which drives us to use technology to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life.","In fact, we're looking to place even more emphasis on innovation driven growth. Technology has always been the lifeblood of this company and growth is the name of the game in Medtech [ph].","We will be laser-focused on getting our organic revenue growth rates up. Getting more aggressive with tuck-in M&A and being decisive with capital allocation to the highest growth segments. All of this will increase our weighted average market growth rate or our WAMGR.","Reinvigorating our diabetes business is also a priority. This is a rapidly growing market that has huge long-term potential. And I'm confident in our ability to leverage our strength to get back to leading the innovation in this space. We have a strong foundation with which to work and a really exciting pipeline of innovation on both the pump and the sensor side.","Also, I am really confident that Sean along with the rest of the diabetes business will get this right. Most importantly, he has committed to improving the patient experience. Now as we do this, along with executing on our product pipeline, we expect to return to share-taking mode.","In fact, we see opportunities for share gains throughout the Medtronic portfolio. And we'll be measuring ourselves on just that. I like to keep things simple. Grow our WAMGR, and measure our business performance or whether we're taking share or not. You'll hear more on these priorities overtime. And I look forward to sharing our full plans with you when we host Medtronic's Investor Day next June.","So at this point, I\u2019ll turn it back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Geoff. Let's now move on to Q&A. In addition to Karen and Geoff, two of our Group Presidents Mike Coyle and Bob White are also here to answer your questions. As Brett Wall and Sean Salmon are new to their roles of running RTG and diabetes respectively, they won't join the earnings call until the next quarter.","Karen, Geoff and I will answer the questions related to those two groups today. As usual, we want to try to get to as many questions as possible. So please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, just a quick one for Karen and maybe a follow-up for Mike. So Karen, just thinking about the back half of your revenue, kind of two-part related question. If we think about, I appreciate the updated guidance for diabetes, but if you look into the back half of the year, you had nice acceleration here in the second quarter and it's sort of deceleration plan for the third in the back half. So anything other than diabetes suggests why the business would decelerate in the back half, and sort of related on earnings, great expansion so far this year, it's not implied much expansion in the back half of the year, and you've got your non-op tailwinds in interest and tax. So kind of into the back-half of the year, anything we should be picking up from the top or bottom line, because it looks on the margin a little conservative, then a quick one for Mike.","Karen Parkhill","Yes, thanks for the question, David. Let me touch on the comps first, because I know there's some question about that. And the FY 2019 comps alone can be a little bit misleading. What dictated the cadence in FY 2019 is really what happened in FY 2018.","Recall in the first half of FY 2018, we faced some significant, but transitory issues. The IT outage, the Puerto Rico hurricane, and for that reason, I would say double-stack of FY 2018 and FY2019 would be a good base comparison where our growth by-quarter with that double-stack was 4.5% 5.3%, 5.5% and 5%.","But comps aside, what is really going to drive our acceleration in the back half is our pipeline. And we have indicated you should start seeing that in 4Q and continuing into next year. And related to EPS, yes we were pleased that we were able to raise our EPS guidance by a total of $0.13 so far this year, $0.03 on the heels of Q2. And while interest tax and FX are a little more favorable, we do plan to reinvest those benefits to ensure that we can fully support our upcoming launches, because they do drive our future revenue growth.","David Lewis","Okay, very helpful Karen. Mike, just real quickly for me. Can you just talk to us about how share is fairing in the low-risk expansion markets, prior to the approvals, any comments you want to make this weekend on data that suggested relative differences in outperformance? Thanks so much.","Michael Coyle","Sure, in terms of overall growth, we were globally growing in the low twenties and in U.S. mid-20s. So it was a little slower than the overall market principally because of the presence now with another competitor in the space, who has taken some modest share in the U.S. as well as the rate of ramp for the new centers that are coming onstream with the NCD.","So we think that's going to bounce around a little bit, but we were very pleased with the growth profile clearly accelerated from where we've been in the earlier part of the year, and late part of last year.","And then terms of the data that was shared at the AHA, we're still digesting those datasets. These were non-randomized datasets that were coming out of France that basically were concentrated in accounts that were heavily users of the [indiscernible] product lines. So we were not sure that the propensity matching that they did is appropriate to what we've seen.","But I think the other piece of it is, they were not using Evolut PRO+ and they\u2019re certainly not using Evolut PRO+ in those datasets where the addition of the [Indiscernible] has really improved the PBL performance and now with Evolut PRO we have the lowest profile devices and we have those pericardial [indiscernible] into the large 34 millimeter size segment.","So we know that there have been multiple randomized datasets that have done these comparisons, and we've not seen that kind of mortality different. So we're going to have to continue just to understand it and digest it.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks David. Next question, please Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America","Bob Hopkins","Oh, thank you. And good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just want to focus on the changed guidance in diabetes for a minute. I guess the specific question would be maybe if you could just go into little more detail on what specifically has changed and driven the reduction in the guidance here. Maybe a sense for U.S. O-U.S. assumptions in the back half. And then more broadly on diabetes, does -- how does this impact your view on the future growth rate of diabetes say in fiscal 2020, 2021? Thank you","Karen Parkhill","Yes, thanks for the question, Bob. We -- Omar did talk about the fact that we're facing competitive challenges in the U.S. in diabetes, while we await new product launches. But international growth continues to grow well. You saw that in our results, and we expect that strong international growth to continue.","In the meantime in the U.S. Omar mentioned we did initiate a next-tech pathway, which you also may have seen advertised. That means that we'll defer some revenue until we can upgrade those patients to the new technology","And in terms of future growth for diabetes, we believe that that will follow our robust pipeline and we expect growth acceleration in that business with the pipeline as we do in many of our other businesses.","Omar Ishrak","I just wanted to get it very clear that we're very excited about this pipeline. The 780G promises to be an outstanding product. We're making good progress in terms of our enrollment in the pivotal trial. We've already submitted for our next-generation hardware for approval with the FDA. And so that whole pipeline is on track. And we're going to go through a period of some pressure especially with new patients in the U.S.","But look, there should be no doubt about our enthusiasm from this pipeline and what we see into the future in diabetes. As Geoff pointed our earlier, this is an area of focus for us and one that we will win in.","Bob Hopkins","Great. And then just one quick follow-up Omar for you is, just -- just wanted to gauge your confidence in the outlook for growth in China. And the reason I ask is that another device company this quarter talked about pricing in China for medical devices being a little more pressured than they anticipated. And while it sounded like a bit of a one-off, I just wanted to make sure we got your opinion on the subject and the outlook for growth in China for your business.","Omar Ishrak","Look we're very confident about China. We've had consistent results there and one that we expect to continue and continue to depend on in terms of double-digit growth coming out of China. There are some different purchasing processes that are in place, and most of these are really around more commoditized products some of which we play in, but the government has been very thoughtful about which products to put into these big tenders. And we feel that the majority of our product line is separated clinically.","In any case even in those situations there are optimizations we can do in the distribution channel through which we can cover that. So look, we're completely confident about our growth, about our growth in China. The team there has performed in a very consistent fashion quarter-after-quarter and we're pretty confident that we can maintain that.","Ryan Weispfenning","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Next question, please Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan.","Robert Marcus","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Karen, I was wondering if you could touch on the cadence of growth in the back part of the year. You talked about four plus percent in third quarter. In the press release, you talked about accelerating topline growth in the back half of the year. What does that imply for fourth quarter?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. So thanks Robbie for the question. We do expect growth acceleration in the fourth quarter as we continue to launch important new products. It's hard to sit here in November, and know exactly which products will hit when. And so, and you also have the possibility that some doctors maybe holding some patients as they await approval for some important things in our pipeline like DBS.","So it's hard to predict and pin down fourth-quarter at this point. But we'll have a better view when we get to the call in February. And in the meantime, just know that we do expect to see growth acceleration from third quarter.","Robert Marcus","Got it. And I was hoping the spine business came in very impressive growth rate here. If you could just talk about a little more detail into robotic placements, what sort of centers are buying here? What percentage of your base has a robot? Any data points you could give us, so we could think about the pull-through going forward? Thanks.","Geoffrey Martha","I'll take this, it\u2019s Geoff. I'll take this one Robbie. Yes, first the results in the spine business, which the best we've seen in a long long long time. It really is a direct result of the surgical synergy strategy, which has real staying power here and has meaningfully improved the intrinsic value of our spine franchises. As you pointed out, it's the capital equipment, the Mazor O-arm navigation, significant placements both placements and sales and the pull-through of the spine implants. It's created a great competitive differentiation and a really nice business model for us.","And, look we're not giving specifics on how many Mazor placements, but I can tell you, it's like the last several quarters meaningfully more than the competition. And so when you stack quarter-after-quarter-after-quarter of meaningfully more placements in the competition, our installed base has gotten pretty big. And this is we've got a lot of momentum here. And when you have an organization like RTG that with the resources and the capabilities if you can get somebody organization like that focused on something like this with this kind of momentum it's going to, it's going to continue. So we feel very good about it.","Robert Marcus","Thank you very much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Robbie. Next question please Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One, two-part question for Mike on CVG and one Pain Stim question for Geoff. So Mike, first on Micra AV, your confidence in approval based on the Marvel 2 data. Just that's an important product for you, but it does small dataset. And second, the sustainability of the TAVR growth you saw this quarter. It sounds like based on your comments that that could potentially accelerate from here?","And just lastly Geoff, do you think we've turned the corner on the Pain Stim market for your business and the market? Thanks for taking the question.","Michael Coyle","Thanks Larry. On the Micra AV, we were very pleased with the Marvel 2 data that were shown at AHA. We had essentially median AV Synchrony levels of 94% which is pretty close to what you would see with a standard pacemakers system. So obviously all the benefits that we will get on complication reduction from no pocket no leads are coming at very little trade-off in terms of the AV Synchrony.","So we think that's going to be very helpful. We believe the dataset is fully consistent with what the FDA wanted to see and has seen. So we've now submitted. And so we have a high degree of confidence of having this product available in the marketplace in the U.S. in the fourth quarter.","And in terms of the sustainability of the TAVR market. Obviously, we were very pleased with the acceleration of growth that we saw as we headed into the low-risk dataset. I would say, we still maintain an expectation for the overall market growth of the TAVR market to be in that $5 billion range in calendar 2021. So we're very comfortable that everything is tracking in terms of how we have expected it to happen over the last several years. And so we feel good about that growth engine for us for the next period of time.","Geoffrey Martha","Okay. On the \u2013 Larry, it\u2019s Geoff on the Pain Stim business. I will split it into two pieces. Here there's the market, and then our performance. On the market, obviously it's as you can see from our larger competitors that have reported the markets come down, and in the short-term I think it's going to be I'll call it flattish. Over the medium and longer-term we do see this getting back to mid-single to high single-digit growth in the SCS space. But it has been, I'd say we're anticipating a flattish market here for the next quarter or two.","And in terms of -- and I do think there's things that can be done to better position SCS space with payers, but in the short-term it is an innovation-driven segment. And we're very excited about our next-generation Intellis. As you know the first-generation did very well, over the last year plus and we already have the next-generation which we'll be talking about when we're rolling out at NANS in January. So we're excited, and over the last quarter we have seen our trialing implants and evaluations have grown the last couple of quarters, as well as our Intellis sales. We're seeing strong Intellis sales as well. So it is picking up. We do see it trending in the right way, but I don't see it getting back to the high single-digits here for a bit.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Larry. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe one on the 3Q guidance here. Sequentially organic seems to be flattish. I'm curious, why MITG would moderate comp seem to be okay in that segment. And then more importantly on diabetes, flat-to-down, how much of that flat-to-downs are you assuming a share loss versus the new, the upgrade program which you assume is you\u2019re deferring revenue recognition maybe parse out the share loss versus the upgrade program impact? Are you seeing any -- are you seeing any delays in FDA approvals because one of your other competitors seems to be having issues on the diabetes side from a regulatory perspective?","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for the questions Vijay. So first on MITG, we had a very strong quarter in MITG and we're not going to extrapolate a very strong quarter in 2Q onto the back half. We still see strength in MITG and we're pleased with that strength. We did have some share gains from a competitor stapler recall in the second quarter and we'll see if that continues. In terms of diabetes, the upgrade program is an impact for us in the third quarter, and in terms of market share, our installed base is increasing, particularly as we as we put 670G's in Europe.","So we're seeing an installed base increase and we're pleased with that. And then in terms of product launches, I'll let Omar comment.","Omar Ishrak","No I think into the product launches, look right now, as I said, we're on track. The most important product launch we have is the 780G. And like I mentioned earlier, we've already submitted our next-generation hardware for approval with the FDA. We've completed delta enrolment and we expect to see the initial pivotal trial results at the ATTD Meeting in Europe in February.","And we expect delta approval first and Pete [ph] approval will follow that. Look the exact timing is up to the FDA. There's no signal to us that things will be unnecessarily delayed or anything like that. So as far as we can see things are progressing as normal. They have their normal questions and we go through this process. So I anything out of the ordinary there.","Vijay Kumar","That's helpful, Omar. And just one quick one on SG&A. Some of the comments you made on OpEx management. It looks like these trends are sustainable. So just curious on OpEx trends going forward?","Karen Parkhill","Yes thanks Vijay. We have said that we expect to deliver 40 basis points of margin improvement this fiscal year and that hasn't changed. You've seen us drive greater improvement in SG&A and a throughout this year and that shouldn't change. We've had some gross margin pressure driven mainly by FX, but we've been offsetting that and continue to deliver the margin expansion that we've committed.","Vijay Kumar","Thanks guys.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with UBS.","Matthew Taylor","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Question for Geoff, you talked a little bit about some growth priorities that you have and really talked about being more aggressive on tuck-in M&A. I guess, I was wondering if we should view that as a little bit of a pivot and if you could expand on the areas that you think are really kind of right for those tuck-ins, and what kind of characteristics would you look for in the deals that you'd like to do?","Geoffrey Martha","First of all, I don't want to know if I call the pivot. [Indiscernible] towards more of a focus on innovation driven growth here for the last year or so, and building up the pipeline and so no more it\u2019s got the whole company focused on pipeline execution. So that's first and foremost is our top priority is executing on that pipeline that we've built. And then, I've been working closely with the group, the group before group leaders including Sean and Brett that are new to it on a capital allocation strategy, that moves to the highest growth segments, that isn't done necessarily at the group level, that's done at a more granular level, and our goal is to through R&D investments and through using our balance sheet for tuck-in M&A to increase that the [Indiscernible] of the company.","And so when we're looking at tuck-in M&A, I'm not going to comment on specific segments, but it's going to be those areas that whether it'd be within the groups or even adjacencies to the groups that are going to grow our WAMGR. And so that's, that\u2019s about it.","Matthew Taylor","And just had a follow-up on the ischemic stroke market that you seem to have really strong results this quarter. One of your competitors talked about a slowdown in that market. Are you seeing any slowdown or are you gaining shares, can you talk about the dynamics there?","Geoffrey Martha","Well the market is still growing pretty strong. Maybe a little bit, maybe a little bit, slightly less than it\u2019s grown over the last recent few quarters. But our performance and our performance has been I'd say better than the competition. And it's coming. It comes down to the strategy that Brett and Stacy [ph] to put in place that's really having a broad portfolio across both the ischemic side and the hemorrhagic side, having good products on all of those areas, it matters in the space. And that strategy is paying off, and we recently launched the new stent retriever, you know on top of the ischemic space, and on top of the new aspiration system, with our two catheters, you combine that with the breadth of the portfolio that's what's driving our results.","And so yes, the market grew a little bit less than it has in the past. We still see this as a very strong market going forward. I mean every, every, everywhere I go in the world outside the U.S. in the U.S. you get asked about stroke, and outside the U.S. you have health ministers asking about how we can help them build out their system. It's just a very robust segment for us right now.","Matthew Taylor","Okay, great thanks for the thoughts.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Matt. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning. Thanks for letting me ask the questions Omar, just a question for you. I think when you took the [technical difficulty] seated in years and creating the term economic value creation if you will, and the evolution to value-based healthcare delivery system has been a little bit slower than expected. Can you -- can you give us your view on how the trajectory of the trajectory of the evolution of the healthcare delivery system?","And then just for Mike, just TAVR question asymptomatic date of the recovery trial was presented at AHA over the weekend. You've been a little bit less vocal than one of your competitors on the asymptomatic opportunity. Can you give us your read through on the recovery trial data and then any plans for an asymptomatic trial with Evolut with the Evolut platform? Thanks for taking the questions.","Omar Ishrak","Okay, let me go first on that value-based healthcare stuff. It's true that when I first started that was an area that we looked at, but really, what we're focused on was what we call the economic value. In other words, we knew how to create clinical value with our products and we needed to understand how that translated into economic value for the system. And while doing so we quickly understood that a lot of the economic value is created outside of the providers themselves who were purchasing our devices.","And so, we try to understand that, and through this process we realize that there's lots of stakeholders here. There's a lot of unknowns in this -- in this system. And in the end, we focused on areas where the technology had a direct impact on value creation and those models we've put in place and they've been very successful and they continue to be successful, led by directs being the most the biggest example of that. And that continues to be good.","In terms of the broader evolution of these models, look this needs complete stakeholder alignment. There's not something that Medtronic can do on its own. That's, that's just not possible. And it needs clear leadership in that direction. I've got no doubt that at some point in the future, the healthcare models have to move to one that's based on paying for value. But like I said, that requires a lot of alignment and it's probably going to take some time.","In the meantime, our understanding of the direct relationship between technology and value we\u2019ll continue to have, and be prepared to go into risk-based models where we have direct control because we've clinical evidence that proves that we can take those risks, and those have been successful.","Michael Coyle","And then Josh in response to your question about the recovery trial. Obviously we view it as good news that there was a positive outcome for intervention, earlier intervention in aortic stenosis with in this case obviously Saber [ph] showing mortality benefit versus conservative management. So we think that's good for the overall space in terms of intervention. We have been a little cooler on the idea of using a lot of investment into the asymptomatic group just based on experiences we've had over the years with -- for example ICDs where the market was really driven by incidence pool as opposed to prevalence pool. And so the availability of the patients to come in when they're asymptomatic is a little bit more of a question.","So when we've done this work, we viewed it as a relatively smaller driver of overall TAVR market growth. In fact, we don't include it in our overall estimates for the market growth. So again, this would only be good news. And we're going to continue to look at as we head into the operating plan period here for the work that we're doing in spaces like mitral, replacement mitral repair. These are large clinical trial requirements as well. Is this the best use of dollars to go after asymptomatic, we'll make that call as part of our sort of normal planning process.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Josh. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse.","Matthew Miksic","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just one on TYRX and just one follow-up based on your last comment Mike on Mitral. So you mentioned TYRX manufacturing. I was wondering if you could give us an update, an uptake there potential plans for guidelines or enhanced reimbursement or any of the things that that you had talked about a little earlier in the year related to Rapid?","Michael Coyle","Yes, so in this past quarter we were completing the move of the manufacturing facility from the manufacturing side in New Jersey that we acquired as part of that acquisition of TYRX into the Rice Creek facility here in Minnesota where we have extensive experience in drug device combinations. As we were ramping that, and obviously we had to ramp it significantly relative to the rapid results being out in last quarter's Q1 growth of in the mid-30s. We began to see yields not where we wanted them. And so we were re-engineering processes associated with that move.","As you know this business, that original facility was under a warning letter, so we're being very careful about making sure we have very robust validation and verification activities taking place, which took some of our manufacturing capacity offline, while we did that work. That has now been completed at the end of last month. We have implemented these new processes and we're ramping nicely in terms of production to a point where I think we're back to normalized production here for the full quarter three. That's certainly is our expectation.","So that's behind us. And we're now driving growth. In terms of guidelines, we continue to work with professional societies around guidelines. And we'll have more to say about that as decisions rollout. But clearly, the availability of the robust evidence that came from Rapid is there has really helped us in terms of being able to drive adoption of the technology as we saw in Q1. And I expect that we will continue to be a valuable to us here in the second half and beyond.","Matthew Miksic","That's great. And then Mike, you mentioned you're sort of picking your spots investment in Structural Heart and mitral and replacement and repair. Just any color or update on either of those fronts if you would?","Michael Coyle","Well obviously we continue to think we have a leadership position in the mitral valve replacement market. And in fact, we now have our transfemoral system locked down in terms of design, and we have approval for the feasibility IDE in that space. And so we're going to certainly be prosecuting those clinical trials. We have important investments going on internally in the repair space. We're not really prepared yet to discuss those publicly. But we do think there are some very interesting opportunities for us in that space that would be complementary to where others are investing in that space.","And then obviously we continue to rollout labeling indications in the TAVR space for the bicuspid market for example is that enrollment has been completed, and we will be pursuing labeling indications or removal of labeling restrictions in that area.","So as I said, we're looking at a number of other things as part of our sort of preparation, with regard to the work we're doing in -- plan in preparation for next year's operating plan. And we'll probably have more to say about that around the time of the Analyst Meeting in June.","Matthew Miksic","Great. Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you Matt, next question please Regina.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray","Matthew O'Brien","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two here together. Sounds like a lot of the products are on schedule for introduction as expected, but the one that seems a little bit aggressive to me is InterStim II. So would just love to hear why you are so confident in the timing of that product coming out.","And then secondly, Mike on the TAVR side of things. You mentioned a little bit of impact competitively, was that impact level less than you expected, more than you expected kind of inline just any kind of color there would be helpful? Thank you.","Michael Coyle","Yes, so Matt on the first one, I \u2013 you know we have InterStim II and Microstream. I'm not sure, did you mean Microstream or InterStim II or both?","Matthew O'Brien","Yes, any color. Thanks.","Michael Coyle","Right. So the Microstream as we we've announced, we submitted that to the FDA and we believe that's on track for mid-calendar 2020 approval. And then also InterStim II which is our that's our Microstream is our rechargeable platform. Again, this is the -- this will be our first rechargeable platform. It will be a three 3CC device, fully -- a full body MR labeling with our proven overdrive battery chemistry on there. So this is going to be a great product. That's the Microstream. That is mid-calendar 2020. And then our InterStim II which will have improved, which is our primary cell device our recharge-free device. The next-generation of that will have that will come out with MR labeling around the same time. So we're feeling. Here we will have a full portfolio of both recharge-free and recharge and feeling really good about that based on the timing of our submissions and the normal FDA review.","Geoffrey Martha","And then in terms of your question about competitive product entry to the TAVR space. Obviously it was March that the third competitor came into the market. And so we're now into about the third quarter of their presence in the marketplace, and we'd estimate they have somewhere between 1% and 2% market share. And that is in line maybe a little lower than we had expected when we put together our operating plan for the entrant. There's certainly trialing going on in the product, and we would expect that to continue, but we think we've done a good job securing our share positions in the face of now at their competitor.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Matt. We\u2019ll take the next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVB Leerink.","Danielle Antalffy","Hi good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just a quick question on the U.S. piece of the business. It looks like that was pretty strong. We're coming to almost 300 basis points of growth acceleration on a comp adjusted basis. I was wondering if you could talk about how sustainable you think that is as we look over the next few quarters and maybe you point out what's sort of driving that, and I have one follow-up on CVG? Thanks so much.","Michael Coyle","Okay let me take the U.S. growth. Look overall, it\u2019s in line with what we were expecting. As we've mentioned many times before, growth particularly in the U.S. is driven by innovation. So when as a new product that comes in, that that increases procedures for the right reasons. Then we get clear growth. And we expect that dynamic to continue. The baseline growth remains pretty consistent, the number of procedures and all of that remains pretty consistent. And whenever we have new product entries that drives the growth rate up, and we don't expect that dynamic to change looking into the future and we expect with the pipeline that we have, and they are all on track and we've got lots of exciting products all the way from the Micra AV pacemaker to the 780G Insulin pump to the InterStim Micro and all the other stuff that we've talked about. All of those things were launched in the U.S. will drive the market up and we'll get share gains as a result of that. So that's the way I look at the U.S. market, it\u2019s really innovation-driven.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay got it. And then on CVG, Mike I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what's driving the modest guide higher in the back half of the year. I guess that it feels like LVADS should start to anniversary some of their tough comps maybe DCB start to stabilize, but otherwise just curious if you could point to what's really driving the upside in the back half of the year in CVG? Thanks so much.","Michael Coyle","Sure. Danielle. The headwinds that you talked about especially LVADS one is clearly now behind us in that we've anniversaried that sort of step change in the market that happened at the end of Q2 a year ago. So that really helps in terms of overall prior year comps. And as you mentioned with DCB, we have now begun to see the sequential growth that we've been expecting as more datasets are available. That basically help address this question, about the safety signal that that has been raised. And obviously the availability of the AV fistula data which was shown at the CIRSE meeting, basically showed we did not see that mortality signal in the one-year data for those datasets, and we saw very significant reductions in reintervention rates more than 50% reductions in reintervention in that AV fistula patient population, which we think will help not just NAV fistulas, which obviously expands DCB markets, but also is going to help us with the confidence in the SFA position.","So those headwinds basically becoming mitigated is helpful. We also have the headwinds associated with the replacement cycle in especially pacemakers and in CRT-D devices that has begun to mitigate and even though we still see pressure in these traditional ICD segment CRT-D is the biggest single replacement component of our market. And obviously pacemakers are a big component as well. So whereas we've had the last couple of years of very significant headwinds, as we head into FY 2021 we are beginning to see that turn into a neutral impact on our overall growth market or growth trends, which then allows us to see the benefits of the new products that are coming into the market","Obviously we talked about the Evolut PRO+ and the low-risk indication. We also are expecting eminently officially indication for the In.Pact Admiral will be introducing our new ICD family on the Galaxy platform, which the cobalt and chrome product lines which are going to add numerous feature set benefits that we'll talk about as we launch the product.","We also have link 2 moving into the market here as we get to the end of the year, but probably the most important of those products is the Micro AV which we expect to have in the fourth quarter and that should help us with that fourth-quarter acceleration that Karen was talking about.","Danielle Antalffy","Thank you so much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Danielle. We\u2019ll take one more question please Regina.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Thank you. Good morning. Maybe a couple of questions. First for Karen, you know I think you described the decline in gross margins was because of currency, but also because of China tariffs. And I'm curious if you could maybe parse out, what is, what each of those is contributing to the decline in gross margins, and is there any view to any improvement in that you know if the tariffs get reduced or any relief there?","Karen Parkhill","Yes thanks for the question Raj. We did see the most significant impact from FX. It was about 70 basis points on the gross margin. And then the China tariffs was a smaller impact. And in terms of gross margin going forward, we expect gross margin to be relatively stable to where it is today in the second quarter going forward. And we anticipate continuing to offset that with SG&A improvement as we further drive margin expansion.","Raj Denhoy","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just lastly on diabetes. And I appreciate the confidence in recovery, they're returning to growth as you move into next year. But I guess, you know when one thinks about the competitive landscape and diabetes, there's going to be some developments from your competitors on automated insulin delivery systems as well. And so the question is really how confident you are that 780G can get you where you need to go and whether you still need to have improvements on the CGM side of that business and particularly in order to see improving results?","Michael Coyle","Yes, I think the 780G will take us a long way and it actually differentiates us in terms of the algorithm over anything that anyone has or from what we can see projecting. And so the advanced hybrid closed-loop system is really going to separate us from that dimension.","I think with the sensor area, we still have work to do. And I think that's going to take a little longer, in reducing the number of fingersticks, where we continue to make progress, but that's going to be an area of pressure even going into next year, but we expect that there are many other benefits for the 780G in terms of not only the algorithm, but in terms of its capabilities that we will benefit from. So that's the way I'd look at it. The sensor area is going to take a little longer to completely resolved. We'll make incremental progress, but that's going to take a little longer.","Raj Denhoy","Great. Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Raj. Omar, any final words.","Omar Ishrak","Well listen. Thank you all for your questions and on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q3 earnings call, which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday February 18th.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic Third Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Sir, you may begin.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our third quarter, which ended on January 25, 2019. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and the revenue by division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook.","During today's earnings call, many of the statements made may be considered forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly revenue growth rates and ranges are given on an organic basis, which exclude the impact of any material acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency, and are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. All of these adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included in our earnings press release. Finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported another quarter of solid top and bottom line performance. Revenue grew 4.4% organic, reflecting the benefits of our diversified model. We leveraged our top line to grow adjusted operating profit 7.7%, and adjusted diluted EPS 10.3% or 8.5% at constant currency.","Execution is our top priority, and in Q3 we executed on multiple fronts to deliver a strong quarter despite difficult comparisons we were facing in the back half of our fiscal year. Revenue out-performance in MITG and RTG, driven by a number of recent product launches offset the challenges in CVG that we talked about in January.","The other big driver was emerging markets, which grew 14%, reflecting a strong quarter across all businesses and geographies. Down the P&L, we saw the benefit this quarter from our focus throughout the organization on margin improvement, resulting in 140 basis points of operating margin expansion, including a benefit from currency.","We continue to execute on free cash flow, working to improve our cash conversion and ultimately drive greater shareholder value. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated over $4.1 billion of free cash flow compared to $2.9 billion in the prior year. We made significant progress on this front, and I really appreciate the engagement of the entire Medtronic team.","Overall, it was another good quarter for Medtronic, but what continues to be even more exciting than our results is the progress we're making in our pipeline. As I commented last quarter, we believe we have more opportunities for growth than at any time in our company's history. I'll come back to the pipeline shortly.","But first, let's review our performance this quarter in a little more detail. I'll start with our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group. MITG had an outstanding quarter growing 6.6% with outperformance in both SI and RGR divisions. Our Surgical Innovations division grew 6.4% with strong growth in both Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling.","Advanced Energy products grew in the low double digits, driven by the adoption of enhanced LigaSure vessel sealing instruments and the Valleylab FT10 energy platform.","In Advanced Stapling, we grew in the high-single digits as our Tri-Staple 2.0 endostapling reloads and Signia surgical stapling system continued to perform well in the minimally invasive surgery market.","Our Respiratory, GI, and Renal division grew 7%, with strong results across all businesses. G.I grew mid-single digits, led by strength in Beacon endoscopic ultrasound products and Bravo reflux testing systems.","Respiratory had high single-digit growth, driven by Puritan Bennett 980 ventilators and Nellcor pulse oximetry products. Renal care grew in the mid-teens with solid sales of Bellco and renal access products.","Next, our Restorative Therapies Group had another strong quarter, growing 5.5%, driven by sustained momentum in the Brain Therapies division. Brain grew 13.2% with high teens growth in both Neurovascular and Neurosurgery.","In Neurovascular, we\u2019re seeing broad strength across our stroke franchise with double-digit growth in stent retrievers, flow diverters, neuro access, and embolic products.","In Neurosurgery, we delivered high-30s growth in capital equipment driven by StealthStation navigation, O-arm imaging, Mazor Robotics, and Midas Rex powered surgical systems.","We launched our Mazor X Stealth Edition robotics guidance platform last month, and we've received early enthusiastic feedback for this combination of best-in-class robotics and navigation capability.","We believe our strong capital equipment sales supporting our Brain Therapies growth are a leading indicator for future growth in our Spine business as customers choose to link future spine implant purchases with the capital equipment that they're acquiring. As we execute more of these contracts, we would expect our core spine implant sales to grow over the coming quarters.","In our Spine division, while results were flat this quarter, when combined with sales of our capital equipment used in spine surgery which is the way many of our competitors report their results, our Spine division grew 4.6% including 5.4% growth in U.S. core spine.","In Brain Therapies, our performance was driven by high-single-digit growth in spinal cord stim as the market continues to appreciate the differentiation of Intellis with its evolved workflow algorithm and Snapshot reporting.","Our Diabetes Group grew 6.5% this quarter. As expected, this group is facing difficult year-over-year comparisons in U.S. pump sales in the back half of this fiscal year. Despite this, we grew 5% sequentially from Q2 including high-single-digit, sequential growth in insulin pumps specifically.","Our performance outside the US was especially strong with Western [ph]Europe, Latin America, and China, growing 25%, 17%, and 16% respectively. CGM as a category grew over 30% this quarter with over 60% growth in Western Europe. Our recently launched standalone CGM system, the Guardian Connect posted its third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth.","Our Cardiac & Vascular Group grew 1.6% this quarter, in-line with the revised forecast we provided in early January with mid-single-digit growth in both CSH and APV divisions. Coronary & Structural Heart had another strong quarter in transcatheter valves with 16% TAVR growth in the U.S. and 15% in international markets.","We're seeing solid momentum in share gains in the U.S., and in other global markets because of the clinical performance characteristics of our Evolut PRO valve and we're the market leader in many regions around the world including Western Europe.","In Aortic, Peripheral, & Venous growth was driven by the continued launch of the Valiant Navion thoracic stent graft system as well as mid-teens growth in both VenaSeal vein closure systems and IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloons.","In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, with mid-single-digit growth in pacemakers and the strength of our Micra transcatheter pacing system, and the Azure wireless pacemaker. This was offset by mid-teens declines in heart failure, primarily due to a mid 40s decline in LVADs as a result of market share loss and heart transplant guideline changes.","AF Solutions grew in the mid-teens, driven by continued growth in cryo-balloons. We also announced the acquisition of EPIX Therapeutics. EPIX is developing what we believe is a highly differentiated technology for the over $3 billion focal catheter segment of the ablation market.","When combined with our leading cryo-balloon technology, EPIX provides us with a complete portfolio of best-in-class AF ablation catheter technology. It's worth noting that CVG services and solutions faced a number of comparison headwinds, including a revenue recognition change that started in the second quarter, a large order from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in the Q3 of last year, and the exit of a product line in Q1 this fiscal year. Excluding services and solutions, CVG's growth would have been 110 basis points higher and CRHF's growth would have been 180 basis points higher.","Now turning to emerging markets, our performance continues to be strong, growing 14% this quarter and now representing 16% of Medtronic revenue. Our strength has diversified across multiple geographies with China growing 13%, South Asia by 23% and the Middle East and Africa by 20%.","In addition, Eastern Europe grew 12%, South East Asia 11%; and Latin America 9%. Our differentiated strategies of public and private partnerships and optimizing the distribution channel are paying-off and making a real difference in emerging markets around the world.","In addition to our solid performance in the quarter, I remain excited about the unprecedented opportunities for growth that our pipeline presents. We are building up in leadership positions in several of the fastest growing markets in med tech by intentionally allocating our capital to high-growth markets and new opportunities. As we invest in these opportunities, we're doing much more than simply improving today's products and therapies.","We are disrupting existing markets and inventing new ones. And when we do this, when we successfully disrupt and invent markets, we distance ourselves from the competition and raise our weighted average market growth rate.","All of this creates significant value for patients, for physicians, for health care systems and for our shareholders. It's worth highlighting some of the most exciting elements of our pipeline that, we expect to bring to market in the near future.","In RTG, as I mentioned earlier, we're just launching the Mazor X Stealth, our integrated robotics and navigation platform, which we expect to drive growth in our Neurosurgery business along with creating demand for our core spine implants.","In Neurovascular, we're now in limited market release of our 071 react catheter and continuing the launch of our Riptide Aspiration System. We expect to launch our next-generation solitaire stent for ischemic stroke by the end of FY 2019.","In FY 2020, we intend to launch our DBS primary cell device, with unique sensing capabilities. The first of a series of disruptive product launches planned in our DBS business.","In CVG, we're awaiting the presentation of two landmark clinical trials, at the American College of Cardiology meeting on March 17th. The first is the interim results of our low risk TAVR study, which has the potential to expand indications for our transcatheter valve therapy to the largest segment of the market.","The second is the results of the rapid trial of our TYRX antibacterial envelope, which could enable guidelines changes in cardiac rhythm implantables. In FY 2020, we're expected to launch our next-generation TAVR valve. The Evolut PRO plus, which features a lower profile and improved predictability of placement for enhanced ease-of-use.","We also expect to launch a next-generation insertable cardiac monitor the Reveal LINQ 2.0 which will include Bluetooth connectivity five-year battery longevity and the ability to monitor additional physiological parameters.","In the second half of FY 2020, we're planning to launch new conventional ICD and CRT-D product families based on our Polaris high-powered technology platform and we expect to receive a new drug-coated balloon indication in the U.S. for the AV fistula market.","Finally, around year-end FY 2020 we're expecting FDA approval for our Micra AV transcatheter cardiac pacemaker, which would enable us to access and disrupt over 55% of the eligible pacemaker market, up from 16% today.","The pipeline at MITG is equally impressive. We're currently expanding into key specialty areas of our Tri-Staple technology and we're launching our new Microstream advanced capnography solutions for the Capnostream 35 Portable Respiratory Monitor.","We are also currently launching a next-generation Sonicision ultrasound dissection system. Regarding our robotic assisted surgery platform, we're hitting key milestones that are on track for an unexpected launch in FY 2020.","We've had several resubmission meetings with regulatory bodies around the world including the U.S. FDA. More than 100 surgeons have used the system and provided us with very positive feedback.","We're also partnering with physician societies to develop guidelines for use of the platform. We believe this robotic assisted surgery platform combined with our industry-leading surgical instruments and surgeon training centers on the world will expand the market for minimally invasive surgery.","In Diabetes, we're continuing the introduction of 670G into new geographies around the world. In FY 2020, we expect to launch our advanced hybrid closed loop system with Bluetooth, which we're calling the MiniMed 780G.","The 780G will feature next-generation algorithms, designed to improve time in range to over 80% by automating insulin delivery following a snack or a meal. In addition the system will reduce the burden of carb counting and enable remote monitoring and remote software downloads. We also expect to submit our application for non-injective designation for our Guardian Sensor 3 in the next few months. So we expect the next five quarters or so to be very exciting, as we bring these innovative pipeline products to market.","However, I'm equally excited about our longer-term pipeline. In CVG, we're developing several technologies that will create large and important new markets, including the Intrepid Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement System and the Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system for hypertension.","We also expect to disrupt existing markets with our pulsed field ablation technology for AF and the Extravascular ICD. When launched, all of these new products are expected to create multiple new multi-billion-dollar growth opportunities.","In RTG, we are developing InterStim micro a 3CC sacral nerve micro stimulator for bladder control with full-body MRI compatibility. In DBS, we expect to build on our sensing technology to develop a closed-loop deep brain stimulation system.","In addition, we're planning to introduce a cranial mount DBS system, leveraging our differentiated miniaturization and battery technology. I'm really excited about our plans to disrupt the deep brain stimulation market with the series of new products and make a real impact to patients.","In MITG, we continue to develop disruptive products for these markets too, with our portable hemodialysis system, as well as the next generation capsule endoscopy product called PillCam Genius. Overall, we expect to launch more than 90 products over the next five years in MITG.","In Diabetes, I hope you saw our announcement this morning that the FDA has granted breakthrough device designation through our personalized closed-loop system. This system will feature real-time personalized algorithms that are designed to automate insulin delivery on a personalized basis that continuously adapts to the user.","The system will also provide insights and predictive diagnostics, unique to the individual, all of which will dramatically simplify diabetes management for the patient.","In addition to this product, we're also advancing our CGM sensor pipeline by reducing the need for calibration and making the census smaller and longer lasting, all while using cognitive computing to enhance personalized insights.","Of course our pipeline is deeper than the few highlights that I've mentioned today. But the key takeaway is that we're executing well on the strongest and most exciting pipeline in Medtronics near 70-year history.","Let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our third quarter financials. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar. Our third quarter revenue of $7.546 billion represented organic growth of 4.4%. Foreign currency had a negative $149 million impact and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.29 and grew 10.3%.","Adjusted operating margin was 29.2%, increasing 140 basis points in the quarter and 120 basis points through the first nine months of the year, including tailwinds from currency.","We continue to drive underlying operating margin improvement as we execute on our company-wide Enterprise Excellence Program, driving improved efficiency, cost savings and generating leverage on solid sales growth. As a result, our SG&A this quarter improved by 70 basis points.","Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 13.4%, which is better than expected due to the increased benefits associated with the finalization of taxes owed on certain returns.","For fiscal 2019, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 13.5% to 14%, including the nonrecurring tax benefits that we have received year-to-date. Excluding those benefits, our full year adjusted nominal tax rate would be approximately 15%. And with the addition of changes associated with U.S. tax reform, we continue to expect a tax rate of 16% to 17% in fiscal year '20.","Third quarter free cash flow was $1.8 billion. Improving cash generation is a priority for all of us at Medtronic from the top of the company on down and you've seen the results of our increased focus on cash flow in our performance over the last several quarters. We remain committed to disciplined capital deployment, balancing reinvestment with returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders.","Year-to-date, we have returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.8 billion of net share repurchases, resulting at a total shareholder pay out of 77% on adjusted net income.","We also remain focused on increasing our return on invested capital through strong execution with our disciplined investment process around R&D and tuck-in acquisitions, including three we recently announced, Mazor, Nutrino and EPIX. We believe that this focus combined with our strong and growing dividend can create long term value for our shareholders.","Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to update our guidance. For fiscal year 2019, we are raising our organic revenue growth guidance to 5.25% of 5.5% which is the top half of our prior range.","This reflects continued strength in MITG and RTG offsetting the second half headwinds in CVG and difficult comparisons in Diabetes. For the year, we now expect RTG to grow 5.5% to 6%, up from 5% to 5.5%; and MITG to grow 5.5% plus or minus up from 5% plus or minus. We continue to expect CVG to grow 3% to 3.5% and Diabetes to grow in the low to mid-teens.","For the fourth quarter, we would expect growth for MITG and RTG to be between 3.5% and 4%. For CVG to look similar to the third quarter and for Diabetes to look roughly flat year-over-year.","I would highlight that our expected fourth quarter growth through for diabetes is a bit of an anomaly given the prior year comparison when we were able to finally clear our large backlog for 670G and Sensor orders.","And on a two year stack basis, the fourth quarter growth in Diabetes should look more normal. Most importantly, as we move into next year, we believe fourth quarter growth represents a likely bottom and as such would expect growth to improve for both Diabetes and the company.","Turning to margins, we continue to forecast 50 basis points of four-year underlying operating margin expansion as we deliver to more than absorb the impact from product mix headwinds, China tariffs and the dilution from the Mazor acquisition.","With respect to earnings, given our operational performance through three quarters including our ability to offset the headwinds I just mentioned, we are increasing our fiscal year 2019 adjusted EPS guidance to $5.14 to $5.16, up from $5.10 to $5.15.","While the impact from currency is fluid if recent exchange rates hold, our full year revenue would be negatively impacted by approximately $425 million to $475 million.","And despite the headwinds on the top line, given the benefits of our hedging program, FX is expected to be a modest positive to fiscal 2019 operating margins, earnings and free cash flow.","Finally on the hills of strong free cash flow performance over the last nine months, we are increasing our expected fiscal 2019 range to $5 billion to $5.2 billion, up from $4.7 billion to $5.1 billion.","And in fiscal year 2020, we expect to make additional progress on improving our conversion of non-GAAP earnings into free cash flow as we continue to drive increased focus across the organization.","Now I'll return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen. Before we go to Q&A, I want to take a moment to thank all of our employees around the world for executing to deliver another strong quarter and fulfilling the Medtronic mission.","As I mentioned at the start, this was another solid quarter where we delivered the top line, along with strong adjusted operating profit and EPS growth. You're also seeing our ability to generate strong free cash flow. This is important as it enables us to both reinvest and return to our shareholders.","As a reminder, we continue to allocate our capital to our biggest growth opportunities as we focus on driving our WAMGR, our weighted average market growth rate upwards and to the right. Our investments are resulting in a pipeline of numerous growth opportunities that has never been stronger.","We expect to develop and bring to market the innovation that will improve the lives of millions of people around the world, help health care systems become more efficient and ultimately grow the intrinsic value of Medtronic.","And when we do this, we expect our shareholders to benefit as well. We know there's much work to be done, but I'm excited about where Medtronic is headed.","With that, let's now move to Q&A. In addition to Karen our four group presidents; Michael Coyle, Bob White, Geoff Martha and Hooman Hakami are also here to answer your questions. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan in our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just two quick ones for me here. Karen and then Hooman, as a related follow up. So Karen very helpful on tax guidance for 2020 as well as currency.","Can you just help us think about margin guidance next year Karen, when I think about gross margin mix headwinds, slower growth relative to SG&A savings, is 50 basis points still a decent way of thinking about 2020?","And then Hooman for you, I appreciate the fourth quarter commentary. How should we think about Diabetes heading into next year. Is this still going to be a high-single-digit growth business for Medtronic or should we start thinking more about mid-single digits as you anniversary the first wave of 670G? Thanks so much.","Karen Parkhill","Good morning, David. Thanks for the questions. So on margin for next year, we are confident in our long-range plan and that continuing into next year of our ability to deliver between 40 and 50 basis points of underlying annual - underlying operating margin expansion.","Hooman Hakami","David, I'll take the next one, and maybe before talking about FY 2020, it's probably instructive to talk about the comps that we're dealing with in Q3 because this impacts Q3, it impacts Q4.","And you've seen a deceleration in the year-over-year growth versus what we posted for the past four quarters, but we have indicated all year that we're coming up against these more difficult comps.","And I'll just maybe call out a few of the critical ones. If you recall, David, in the back half of last year, we started to increase CGM capacity that allowed us to fulfil shipment, pent-up demand for both pumps and CGM that carried over from the first half of last year.","In addition, in Q3 of this year, we anniversaried Animas, and so all of the consumable revenue and all of the out-of-warranty conversions no longer provide a year-over-year benefit. And then the third thing in Q3 of last year, we also had one of the last large commercial payers approve the reimbursement of 670G.","All of these three things distorted the year-over-year performance in Q3, they will do so as well in Q4 and it's primarily a U.S. dynamic. And maybe just to kind of point at it -- point out some perspective, to give you a flavor for the impact of the comps, last quarter Diabetes delivered $583 million of revenue and we grew 27%.","This quarter we're delivering $610 million of revenue which is 5% higher than it was a quarter ago, and our growth rate is 6.5%; and so hopefully that should give you a sense of the difficult comps. That's going to carry into Q4 and you\u2019ve heard sort of the outlook from -- in the commentary from Karen for Q4, but from a growth rate standpoint, we absolutely expect Q4 to be the low point for Diabetes growth. We expect the comp dynamics to normalize. We expect the return to growth in Q1 of next year, and then for FY 2020 certainly the full-year comp impact will normalize, and we are very confident that Diabetes is going to grow above the corporate average as we\u2019ve indicated all along.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks David. Next question please operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. As we go back to our models and take a look at fiscal year 2020, could you please remind us of some of the puts and takes as we think about all of that?","I know you've previously commented on foreign exchange and tax, but I just want to make sure that street numbers get set up correctly as we head into next year? Thank you.","Karen Parkhill","Thanks, Joanne. Appreciate the question. Yes, we are continuing to work our annual plan right now, so it's early for us to issue our full year outlook. We'll do that on our fourth quarter call.","But from what we can see today, we are confident in our ability to deliver a 4% plus topline revenue growth on an organic basis despite the fact that our pipeline is weighted to the back half of the year and that's obviously in line with our long-range plan.","As I mentioned to David too, we're also confident in our ability to continue to drive annual underlying operating margin expansion to the tune of 40 to 50 basis points, also consistent with our long-range plan. I mentioned that you should continue to model our tax rate next year to be between 16% and 17%. We're continuing to work that tax rate as well as any other additional financial levers, but at this point we are comfortable with current street consensus.","And on an FX basis, FX has been a headwind for us in the fourth quarter. We expect that to -- in the third and fourth quarter, we expect that to continue into next year. From an FX perspective, we would expect FX to be about several hundred million dollars on topline on the headwind and a modest impact on the bottom line. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bob Hopkins","Hi, thank you. And good morning. So just one clarification, either Omar or Karen, I think you said a couple of times on the call that fourth quarter organic revenue growth rate would kind of be the low point for Medtronic.","So I just - to be specific what is - could you just remind us what is your specific Q4 organic revenue growth rate? And I just want to confirm that I heard that correctly, you think going forward that's the low point? ","Karen Parkhill","Yes. So when you look at our full year forecast or our full year guidance for revenue growth that would imply about 3% plus or minus for the fourth quarter Bob. And that's what we're referring to as our low point.","Bob Hopkins","Okay. And then the other thing I wanted to kind of follow up on is just, in terms of the upcoming ACC meeting, I was wondering if you could just help us sort of set expectations heading into that meeting? Sort of any comments around setting expectations would be helpful?","And then, specifically on TYRX, may be help us, if that study is positive can you kind of frame the market opportunity and how you might be able to bundle with ICDs? Just -- if that trial is positive how should we think about incremental opportunity there? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay, Mike. ","Mike Coyle","So Bob, obviously the two late rating clinical trial presentations that we have coming up at the ACC are the low risk TAVR study and TYRX. Both of those have been accepted and we\u2019ll also have simultaneous publication.","On the TYRX in particular, we would estimate right now about one-third of what we would consider high risk device implant, actually use the TYRX product. So that would imply that if we have obviously a 7,000 patient study, we do have the power to answer the question of who is going to benefit from this.","That it would give us if positive ammunition to basically highlight the sets of standard of care in what we consider to be high-risk in order what -- what we consider high risk is in large device implant on ICD or CRT device, CRT-P device or any de novo implant of those or any replacement procedure including pacemakers.","So again, right now we have a utilization of about, one-third of our cases are actually using a TYRX by being able to add about $1000 per procedure and given the unique nature of this technology, it's only available from us.","We think we can use it to drive market share as well in terms of both initials and potentially even on replacement basis. So we consider it to be a very important technology and a very important study. ","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor with UBS. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I appreciate you talked about a lot of big pipeline drivers coming up here in fiscal 2020. And I was curious if you could get any kind of update on your surgical robotics program?","That's one where investors have a lot of focus and we're still waiting for some more details on what that looks like and when it might come into the fold. So can you give us the latest and greatest there? And just how you're feeling about that program?","Omar Ishrak","Bob go ahead. ","Bob White","Thanks, Matt. And appreciate the question. So as Omar mentioned during his commentary, we had actually over 100 surgeons use our robotic systems and in fact, just a couple of weeks ago I had a chance to sit in when one of them during our preclinical labs as we did a partial nephrectomy.","And as I chatted with the lead surgeons you could tell, it was really impressive experience both from the aspect of the way the system performed, the procedure, the workflow associated with the system.","And so, as we previously communicated we're absolutely on track for FY 2020 launch. But importantly, and I think interesting to you is once procedures have begun and we're collecting additional clinical data, they will arrange opportunities for you to experience one of these cases live. So we're excited with our progress. We're excited with the feedback we get and we're excited to bring the system.","Matthew Taylor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Next question please operator?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matt Miksic","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'll keep it to one. So for Karen you mentioned that \u2013 just maybe for background, the changes you talked about in January to the tax rate and the impact on the bottom line growth. Clearly, non-op impact and you've reiterated here just a couple of questions ago I think the top line growth of 4% plus and the 40 to 50 basis points of margin improvement.","So operationally, if look at 2020, I guess I'm asking a question but kind of confirming that it's fair to think about operationally the sort of long-range plan in effect and hitting on those metrics.","I guess, the question is below the line you mentioned some financial opportunities and I guess, I'm thinking below the line either in the deadline or other non-off-line to sort of help offset the non-impact of tax.","If you could maybe flush out what some of those might be and perhaps what some of those were as you're heading into the end of the year is to have \u2013 how you can potentially offset that be very helpful? Thanks.","Karen Parkhill","Yes. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate your question. And I definitely appreciate the fact that you got that our long-range plan holds for next year on an operational performance basis. Below the line there are additional financial levers. Looking at our tax rate and what we can do to work to improve that.","Also looking at our interest expense and income line item, and then obviously share repurchase. We will focus on all of those levers and when we have updates on that we'll be sure to give them to you.","Omar Ishrak","Let me just try to put little word here. I understand operationally all the things that Karen just said and you understood and I can confirm that, but let's not forget about pipeline. Our pipeline is extremely exciting.","We have some really some exciting new product introduction next year, the micro EVs one that I'm really excited about, the robotics and so on. So let's not forget that. Operationally, we'll be there but the pipeline sets us up normally for next year but for the future as well.","Matt Miksic","Terrific. Thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Matt. Next question please operator?","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Pito Chickering","Good morning. Very impressive short term and long term pipeline of new products, I will sit back and look at the R&D center this whole \u2013 I think it's a \u2013 potential revenues. It's been pretty consistent despite the strong pipeline.","So two questions, the first one, with the strong pipeline ahead does it make sense to increase R& D spend - took advantage of your momentum? You have a new products. And second from a process perspective how is IR tracking versus your own internal expectations? And how does that changed over the last few years?","Omar Ishrak","Let me just take on that. And then Karen maybe can add to it. First of all, our pipeline is funded. So we're spending R&D money to fund our pipeline and we will make sure that that happens.","As we see overall operational success, the first place will put our money into its organic R&D spending because that's the highest return that we can get out of any kind of investment that we make.","Having said that, we also always look at continued R&D productivity. We look at sharing between different groups, transferring of technology between one group and another that makes our R&D more efficient and it actually accelerates pipeline, miniaturization technology and back technology are the two biggest examples where our fixed capability can move across different groups and make that R&D quite efficient.","So that's the way we look at that and I think from a return perspective there's certainly within our projections, the organic ones and I think most of the acquisitions too have had returns that are better than our cost of capital. So Karen you want to add to that?","Karen Parkhill","Well said. The only thing I would add is that we're focused on improving our overall return on invested capital for the whole company and obviously our R&D pipeline is a big part of that. And as we look at tuck-in acquisitions, we\u2019re focused on making sure that those ROICs are strong and accretive for the company too.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Pito. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice print there. So just may be I\u2019ll limit myself to one question. Maybe I'll have two bits in that question, but Omar for you. If you look at the organic for the company its coming really, really strong we're looking at close to 5.5 for fiscal 2019.","You are talking about pipeline. When we think about first half versus second half of next year, are we looking at first half may be at the low end of your four to five, and maybe back half coming in at the high-end? When these pipeline -- when it actually comes to fruition, is that organic going to accelerate in that fiscal 2021?","And then Karen for you just quickly on margins. 40 to 50 bps at constant-currency, but I think I heard you say FX headwinds a few hundred million dollars on top, but more modest. Does that imply their FX is going to be a benefit drop next year on margins? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. First of all I think you're right about the pipeline that it is backend loaded towards the second half of the year and as the quarters progress you'll see the benefit of that in our growth rates and I think you read that correctly.","But I think more importantly the other point that you made is that product introductions are the starting point. These things carry through into FY 2020, 2021 and filling these products will get approval in other countries and other new products will also come up towards FY 2021.","So again from a product introduction perspective you'll see a gradual increase backend loaded like you mentioned and the growth rate will correspondingly follow that lower end of first half, higher in the second half. I think that's the right way to look at it.","Karen Parkhill","And then the other thing I would add Vijay is that we mentioned that we think that our fourth quarter growth rate is a low point for us and so you can think about that as you look ahead next year too.","And then from a benefit, your question about benefit on FX on operating margin line. We see FX as being a headwind for us and you can expect a little bit of a headwind on the operating margin line right now at least where we are today and where our hedging is right now.","Vijay Kumar","All right. Thank you, guys.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Vijay. Next question please operator.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Robbie Marcus","Great. Thanks for the question. Hooman, I wanted to circle back to diabetes and you talked about the outlook for 2020. But I want to touch on the breakthrough designation you got this morning for the Personalized Closed Loop pump.","Maybe talk about with the recently acquired Nutrino Health adds to this? When we might see data and approval of this in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Is there a new hardware involved on the CGM and pump side ? And maybe touch on how this compares to where you think the competition is in next-generation systems? Thanks.","Hooman Hakami","Okay. Thanks Robbie. What I'll say is there's probably not enough time on this call to do first-line closed loop justice, but I'll give you kind of a flavor for it. We really think that Personalized Closed Loop is going to be a system that truly paves the way for a true closed loop system.","And because of that we just - we don't feel that closing a loop is aspirational any longer, it's actually achievable. And if you really think about today's algorithms, Robbie, they essentially behave the exact same way for every single patient even though every single patient is different.","Personalized Closed Loop changes all that. It's real-time system. It automates all facets of insulin delivery in a way that is personalized and adaptive to the user. In addition the system is going to provide unique insights to help the patient, help them with predictive diagnostics which we think is going to dramatically simplify diabetes management for the patient. And so we really think this is going to be a transformative system and we're thrilled to have received breakthrough designation for it from the FDA.","Now, as far as launch date goes and all of that, we just received a breakthrough designation. For competitive reasons, I think it would be premature to talk about launch dates, but what I will say and you touched on this is that we're investing heavily in Personalized Closed Loop.","Our acquisition of Nutrino was made with Personalized Closed Loop in mind. We are fully resourced from an R&D standpoint to drive this program as aggressively as possible and we're excited to share more details with you as we progress with the program.","Robbie Marcus","Is that something we might see data at ADA 2020?","Hooman Hakami","Yes. So, ADA 2020, I think, we will outline for you more details around Personalized Closed Loop for sure. And I think what you will see as we start to more articulate what the system is and what the capabilities are, you'll see that it will be completely differentiated with respect to -- not only what's out there today, but what's also coming.","Robbie Marcus","Thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Rob. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Bruce Nudell","Good morning. And thanks for the question and congratulations on a very balanced quarter given the challenges you had. I have a question for Mike. Mike I know the upcoming trials at ACC are embargoed, but could you just help investors think about on the basis of death and stroke, in particular, is superiority needed to change the paradigm of surgery versus TAVR in that low-risk population?","And I think it's important because there are probably around 3,000 surgeries that suddenly come on a table. Just your thoughts about -- surgery might be great, but does TAVR go to the runner or do you actually need superiority to kind of change the discussion between patients and practitioners? Thanks so much.","Mike Coyle","Well, certainly, we've seen patients be highly enthusiastic about less invasive approaches to therapy. And so there is a large patient pool that is associated with these technologies in TAVR and ultimately, in the mitral space.","So I think non-inferiority is certainly a good starting point at this stage, if that's where it ends up. But over time, from my perspective, as we get more experience with these technologies and we see durability in the technology, we're going to see significant patient pool to expand in the market.","Bruce Nudell","Thanks so much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Bruce. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro","Good morning, guys. Thank you. Omar, I had a question, I guess, for you and both Karen, on expense growth in the context of your margin goals. You have a number of pretty compelling technologies on the table between robotics, the TAVR market expansion, diabetes, heading into next year.","So I'm interested in how you - if you could help frame the way in which you're going to fund those growth initiatives whilst delivering the margin expansion? Are there other couple areas of obvious savings on the SG&A line that would help a lot with that? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","You're right. Look, there's two big areas that we look at. In the SG&A line, we're looking at better productivity in our go-to-market methodologies. In our \u2013 primarily on the back office, commercial back offices, which we're concentrating and putting into one place. That actually saves a lot of money.","We're also using new types of technologies to be able to do these processing tasks much more efficiently. So the commercial back office and the commercial go-to-market, not from a sales person perspective, but more from a support perspective is a good area of opportunity for us and that will yield a lot of dividends.","The other one which we've mentioned all along in our program is in full flight and we've got a program to reduce the number of manufacturing sites we have, from, I don't know, 80 or 90 a few years ago, to more like 50 to 60. And, I mean, that clearly gives us some level of productivity.","In addition to that, we have a continuing effort in each factory to improve the efficiency of our lines through different quality processes that are continuously improving. And improving in sites which already have those processes and we put them into new sites as they get ready for production.","So I think those are the main drivers to which we get cost reduction. The back office, commercial back office and the cost down programs we're concentrating on manufacturing sites. Our supply -- our overall indirect and direct supply also, because of our sites is the leverage point.","And finally, our services from our functions are ones that we monitor a lot like HR, finance, legal, et cetera. We monitor those services and we compare them to benchmarks against companies of our size and we expect to be best-in-class in one or two of those areas or higher, because of the integration we had to do.","But over the next few years we'll get them to best-of-class and that will also give us \u2013 free us \u2013 free some extra funds to do the R&D which we're focused on. I think I covered it. Karen, anything to add? ","Karen Parkhill","You totally covered it. I would just say that our Enterprise Excellence Program is specifically designed to drive that operating margin expansion and enable us to continue to invest heavily in R&D.","Isaac Ro","Got it. Thanks very much guys.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Isaac. ","Isaac Ro","Thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Karen one for Mike. So Karen, on the guidance in fiscal Q4 is about 3% organic you said and you expect that to be at the bottom. I guess my question is, when we look at a first half of fiscal 2020, why would it be higher than that 3%? What drives the improvement? Anything besides the diabetes comps getting easier?","And then Mike, I think drug-coated balloon that mid-teens growth this quarter came in better than people expected. Just any color or commentary on the outlook for that business? Thanks for taking the questions.","Karen Parkhill","Sure. Thanks Larry. You are already noted the comps which is a big deal. We had very tough comps in the back half and that changes as we move into next quarter. When we think about CVG too, we expect that to improve as we launch new products.","But also keep in mind that we will anniversary the revenue recognition change that we made to the services and solutions part of CVG in the first quarter. And then we'll also anniversary the MCS decline in the third quarter. So hopefully those things help you. ","Mike Coyle","And Larry as it relates to drug-coated balloons, we actually -- we're quite pleased with the growth profile of the business. Obviously in January we're a little concerned when that med analysis came out where we saw certain accounts basically kind of pushing the pause button on utilization, while they waited for additional data.","I think the communication across the board from the manufacturers looking at their own data in detail and especially our randomized controlled data in both the U.S. pivotal trial, the Japan trial and our Global Registry Data were helpful in terms of providing a patient level analysis.","And then we've seen independent publications like the one we saw in JAMA here last week, that basically we showing on claims databases, no correlation with desk for paclitaxel. So as more and more data come out, it's obviously getting the market more comfortable with the conclusions around the performance of the technology.","We know it off a significant efficacy benefits relative to standard balloon technology. And for us, we are looking at continued expansions and indications for use into new areas. We should have U.S. approval for AV fistula indication in FY 2020 and we continue to do work on below the knee. So we see that technology as an important strong long-term growth driver for our AVF business. ","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Larry. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with SVD Leerink. Please go ahead.","Danielle Antalffy","Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. Mike a quick question for you on heart failure business and as expected, we saw some weakness in LVAD. Just curious how you're seeing that continue to play out there? How much of that would you characterize was impact from competition versus the change in the transplant guidelines. Just trying to get a sense of the go forward outlook just for that market and for that business overall? And then I had one quick follow up. Thanks.","Mike Coyle","Sure. Well, the two issues that identified at the JPMorgan Meeting were almost simultaneous, right, the approval of the competitive HeartMate 3 product and the changes to heart failure guidelines. As we went through the quarter the front end of the quarter really took the brunt of that -- sort of market correction.","We think the U.S. market was down 20% to 25% as basically LVADs -- patients with LVAD were kind of put to the bottom of the list where heart transplants. And obviously a lot of those patients are now being bridged to transplant with technologies like ECMO. So the question will be, how did they do in their transplant surgeries when they're on a less robust support system over time? And obviously that's going to take new quarters to play out in terms of being able to look at, what it does to the overall market. But clearly, the bigger issue for us was the competitive share shift that we saw.","Our competitive brought out a meaningful improvement over their older technology. There was a lot of interest in the market to try it and see how it was performing. We had seen some of those accounts coming back, but there is a big correction that now has taken place. And I think whereas we were looking at sort of a 35% market share prior to that new product coming in.","During this quarter, it was closer to 20%, on a global basis it has settled out at sort of a 25% share price for us. I think that is probably a good way of thinking about the go forward for the overall market.","We obviously have a lot that we're working on in terms of our dichotomy indication for a less invasive surgical placement for the HVAD technology and we have a number of important technology developments that are taking place to the system that we think can help improve complication rates to both go-to-market and grow our shares. So but at least in the short term, this will be a headwind for us for the next several quarters.","Danielle Antalffy","Okay. And you answered my follow-up on what's next. So thank you so much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Danielle. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart","Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Karen, I just wanted to quickly make sure I understood your comments correctly on the consensus EPS for next year. I think you had said you're comfortable in that and that implies about \u2013 I guess 5.6%-ish growth.","I thought in January you guys were saying that it might be 150 basis points off the CAGR. How should we just think about that overall kind of growth for next year? And then just longer-term, I think in the breakout commentary Mike had mentioned something about growth perhaps coming in a little bit higher in 2021, because of some of the new products and just want to kind of flush out how should we really think that 8% mark?","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for the question, Kristen. So FY 2020, we've talked about \u2013 we've got the big headwind of our tax rate. We also have some FX headwinds that I mentioned. So at this point, yes, we are comfortable with current street consensus and we will give our annual outlook on our fourth quarter earnings call.","We're continuing to work our long-range plan. But at this point, I would say, we're comfortable. As we think about the strength of our pipeline though, it is weighted towards the back half of next year and beyond. And so we're really excited about that and beyond piece of it.","Omar Ishrak","Yes. Just to sort of confirm that Kristen clearly as the pipeline comes through it's going to \u2013 the growth rate is going to accelerate and we're very confident in the plan that we've laid out the 4%-plus growth rate overtime and it's too early to talk about \u2013 tell you what are these plan, but clearly the expectation is as the quarters go by here the rate will grow \u2013 will rise and just the pipeline itself would imply that. So we're confident in increasing growth profile over time as we look into the future.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. And then I think the two things that you mentioned on the pipeline Intrepid and simplicity longer term. Just quickly on that Intrepid are you now able to do that transeptly and any sort of data that we could be expecting on neither that program or simplicity in the near-term?","Omar Ishrak","I think Mike go ahead. ","Mike Coyle","So on Intrepid we continue to enroll in the APOLLO study. We've been very pleased we have not seen any drop off in enrollments rates in the wake of collapse data. And we continue -- these are all typically delivered technology or products right now. We continue to work on the pipeline for transfemoral, and obviously we're still making a strategic decision around how small do we need to make the profile of the device, we can make it transfemoral right now or in a trance assignment.","It's a large technology. So the decision whether to actually make that a -- engineer a smaller solution and then go into market with it, or into clinical trials with it or to go with a larger version that we're currently developing is still a work in process.","And then on the Simplicity trial ,we continue to enroll in both the off med on med pivotal trial results which will be the basis for the PMA approval. We would expect data availability for that early in FY 2021.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Kristen. Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question please.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, thank you. Good morning. May be, Omar I could ask about emerging markets? Another very strong quarter. I think it contributed about -- a little over two points of your growth in the quarter.","So maybe could help us understand if there are particular products that are driving that? And how we can get comfortable with the sustainability of that contribution going forward?","Omar Ishrak","Well, yeah, I'm glad you brought that up. I was going to make a comment anyway because for sure our pipeline is exciting, but the emerging markets performance and consistency and its gradual increase over time is something that we feel pretty good about.","And I think the way to look at that is look -- there's no question about the demand rising and the fact that there\u2019s a huge opportunity to increase penetration of existing products, which have been approved like for years.","And we've over time built core expertise in how you do that in aligning patient awareness, helping build infrastructure and training physicians and then deploying our technologies. So that process -- and then going direct or optimizing our go-to-market strategies in those emerging markets. You put all of that together that's our strategy.","Now that is something that you just flip a switch and you do it. You build that expertise over time and we've done that over the last I'd say at least five to seven years. And we have got a pretty clear understanding of how to continue to grow on that platform.","And so we're pretty consistent -- we're pretty confident about the consistency of this double-digit profiling in emerging markets. I'm sure there will be macroeconomic changes here and there but by enlarge the health care need is somewhat independent of that and also the geographic diversification we have within emerging markets has proven to be an asset in enabling us to demonstrate consistency.","So yes we are very confident in emerging markets of maintaining the double-digit profile and one that we've built a track record on, build experience on, and one you can depend on.","Raj Denhoy","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Raj. Omar, do you want to finish?","Omar Ishrak","Yeah, sure. Thanks. Thanks everyone. Thanks for question. And on behalf of the entire management team, thanks for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress and the results for a full year on our Q4 earnings call, which we currently anticipate holding Thursday May, 23. So thanks again to everyone for participating and for your support.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect."],"13802":["Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call August 22, 2017  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Ryan Weispfenning - Investor Relations","Omar Ishrak - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Karen Parkhill - Chief Financial Officer","Mike Coyle - President, CVG","Bryan Hanson - President, MITG","Geoff Martha - President, RTG","Hooman Hakami - President, Diabetes Group","Analysts","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo","Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets","Matt Taylor - Barclays","Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Good morning. My name is Darla and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Medtronic First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning. Please go ahead.","Ryan Weispfenning","Great. Thank you, Darla. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our first quarter which ended on July 28, 2017. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook as well as details related to our patient care, nutritional insufficiency and DVT divestiture to Cardinal Health. During this call, many of the statements maybe considered forward-looking statements and actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016 and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis. Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Good morning and thank you, Ryan and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $7.4 billion representing growth of 4%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.12 growing at 11%. Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our underlying businesses and the stable growth of our markets as well as the diversification benefit of our groups and regions. While the temporary sensor supply constraint and an IT disruption affected first quarter revenue growth, we continued to drive operating margin expansion. This margin improvement combined with the previously communicated tax benefit this quarter translated into strong earnings leverage. Looking ahead, we have now entered a period of clear acceleration in our innovation cycle and we expect to see increasing revenue momentum from several important new product launches over the balance of the fiscal year.","Before discussing the details of the meaningful progress we are making in each of our growth strategies, let me briefly cover two specific issues that affected our first quarter performance. In our Diabetes Group, we are experiencing strong demand around the world for our new diabetes technology. This demand is a direct result of our differentiated strategy to move towards fully closed loop systems, which utilized our algorithms and CGM sensors to automate insulin dosing. We launched the MiniMed 640G in international markets in 2015 and the world\u2019s first hybrid closed loop system the MiniMed 670G with Guardian Sensor 3 in the U.S. in June. These advancements have increased our installed base and market share resulting in a large increase in CGM demand above our already high expectations.","To put it in perspective in just the past 10 quarters since launching the 640G, our overall sensor unit demand has more than doubled. The increased demand is largely for the new highly accurate generation of sensors enhanced in light in international markets and the Guardian Sensor 3 in the U.S. and has temporarily outstripped our production capacity. We accelerated plans to increase sensor production capacity last year. But these lines are not expected to be ready for commercial production until our fourth quarter at which time we expect to have the capacity needed to meet the rapidly growing sensor demand. Until then we have to prioritize sensor fulfillment towards our installed base of customers. In the short-term, this leaves less available for high revenue generating new patient system sales.","It is also important to note that our priority access program necessitated by the early approval of the 670G which allowed customers to purchase a 630G and then swap it for 670G once available for a small fee has been very successful, with close to 32,000 enrollees exceeding our original expectations. However, because we only recognized a small portion of deferred revenue when exchanging the pumps the program currently affects both revenue and margins. We expect to complete fulfillment to our priority access customers later this fall. owards the end of the fiscal year, we expect our diabetes group to be in a position to capitalize on its differentiated innovation in the marketplace with stronger revenue and profit growth not only from increasing sales of our leading insulin pump technology but also ongoing sensor annuity revenue.","Next, let me update you on the IT system disruption that occurred in June. As we communicated over the course of the quarter publicly, including an 8-K and 10-K filings, we experienced a global disruption to an IT system on June 19 that affected our ability to process, ship and manufacture orders globally. During the days following, we mobilized resources as quickly as possible to not only identify the underlying issue, but also put in corrective measures to restore the system. As a result our system was subsequently and fully operational later in that week. After the system had been fully restored we engaged Ernst & Young to conduct an independent root cause analysis in partnership with our own technology experts and our vendor partners. The independent analysis concluded that the root cause was due to inadvertent human error which caused the mis-configuration within certain data storage systems and resulted in our IT system becoming inoperable. Both our internal analysis and the independent analysis found no evidence of external actor involvement, data exposure or compromising this event. Based on our internal findings and that of UI, we are taking appropriate actions to prevent this type of event from happening again, including but not limited to improvements aimed at IT network design, hardware and software systems enhancements, operating processes and execution and governance.","While the IT disruption did have some impact on our overall performance for the quarter it was not material for our quarterly revenue or earnings per share. We continued to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and double digit EPS growth in line with our long-term expectations. This event could have had a more significant impact in the quarter if not for the outstanding work and commitment of our employees around the world and the understanding and the partnership of our customers. Our team rose to the occasion to ensure product was available to customers and patients during the discussion and then worked tirelessly to fulfill backlog that built up during the event. This resilience and round-the-clock commitment of our Medtronic team made all the difference and ultimately allowed us return to normal operations expeditiously and effectively. There is no longer any outstanding backlog associated with this event and our IT system is operating normally. We are pleased to put this event behind us.","Now let\u2019s discuss each of our growth strategies; therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. In therapy innovation we are seeing strong adoption of our innovative new products across all of our business groups. In our cardiac and vascular group which grew 6% we are leveraging the breadth of our products and services as well as our strong positions in important rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth. In the first quarter transcatheter valves, AF ablation, LVADs, transcatheter pacing systems, insertable diagnostics, atherectomy and drug coated balloons all contributed to CVG\u2019s strong performance. In TAVR we delivered growth in the high-30s in both the U.S. and international markets. And looking ahead to expect our recent U.S. FDA approval for intermediate risk and global rollout of our Evolut PRO valve to drive continued TAVR growth.","In coronary, we gained drug-eluting stent share with our recently approved Resolute Onyx in both the U.S. and Japan. And we expect this product to increasingly drive meaningful coronary growth as we go through the fiscal year. Next our minimally invasive therapies group grew 3% or 5% after adjusting for the divested businesses that will no longer be part of our reported results starting in the second quarter. With mid single-digit growth in our Surgical Solutions division driven by new products in Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling. In Advanced Energy, we continue to rollout the new LigaSure instruments in our Valleylab FT10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling, our endo stapling specialty reloads with Tri-Staple technology are driving growth. We also continue to rollout Signia, our new single-handed powered surgical stapling system that provide surgeons with real-time feedback during surgery. These innovations are providing momentum to the transition from open surgical procedures to minimally invasive procedures, or MIS resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. At the end of this fiscal year, we intend to further our goal of moving procedures from open to MIS with the first-in-human use of our surgical robot platform. We look forward to bringing a more comprehensive value proposition to our customers across all key surgical areas: open surgery, traditional MIS, robotic surgery and services.","Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 2% this quarter. And within RTG, our Spine division grew 1%. We estimate that both the U.S. and global spine markets have slowed modestly. However, we continue to gain market share which we attribute to the success of our speed to scale new product launch initiative. We also continue to gain market traction with our surgical synergy strategy growing the number of customer contracts that combine our spine implants with capital equipment for imaging, navigation and powered surgical instrumentation sold by our neurosurgery business. Our Brain Therapies division grew 7% driven by high-teens growth in Neurovascular and high single-digit growth in Neurosurgery. Brain Therapies continues to see traction from our recently launched StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system and strong low 30s growth of our Solitaire family of revascularization devices for acute ischemic stroke.","Turning to diabetes, while revenue growth declined 1% given the reasons mentioned earlier, we gained global durable pump and consumables share driven by significant clinician and customer demand for our 6 series pumps. CGM revenue grew in the low 20s, including growth of nearly 50% in international markets driven by demand for our sensor-augmented pumps and improved sensors. The Guardian Sensor 3s coming off our production line consistently demonstrate the MARD, which is a measure of sensor accuracy of 10.4% in a real world setting in line with the performance we saw in the pivotal studies, with a much larger sample size.","Next, let\u2019s turn to our globalization growth strategy. Emerging markets grew 12% in line with our long-term double-digit growth expectations as we continue to expand access to our products and services around the world. Our consistent emerging markets performance continues to benefit from geographic diversification, with strong results across the globe. Latin America grew 16% with double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Argentina with continued strong results in China growing above the market with 12% growth as we continue to consistently perform in a complex environment that we believe will become one of our largest markets. Southeast Asia delivered 12% growth, with Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand all delivering robust results. In the Middle East, we grew 12% as we begin to see recovery in the region. In particular, Saudi Arabia grew in the mid-30s, our first quarter of growth in six quarters as customer inventory levels appear to have normalized and hospitals have to begun to purchase again.","Let\u2019s turn now to our third quarter strategy, economic value. We continue to see success in our Hospital Solutions business, which grew double-digits as we are now managing cath labs and operating rooms for nearly 140 customers around the world, including our first in Mexico. We are also seeing strong growth in our TYRX value-based program for infection control and implantable devices more than doubling the accounts and the contract in the quarter to 325. Now, approximately 10% of our U.S. CRHF implantables revenue is covered under a TYRX related value-based healthcare risk sharing arrangement. In diabetes, we were pleased to announce a new outcomes-based agreement with Aetna. We are a component of our pump reimbursement with now successfully meeting clinical improvement thresholds.","We are aggressively developing other unique value-based healthcare solutions across each of our groups. While we are still early in the journey, we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients and healthcare systems as well as our shareholders.","Before turning the call over to Karen, I would like to highlight that we closed our transaction of Cardinal Health at the beginning of the second fiscal quarter, divesting a portion of our patient monitoring and recovery division. We expect this transaction to have a positive impact on our revenue growth rates and margins with modest near-term earning solution. We remain committed to the disciplined portfolio management and capital deployment that balances return to shareholders with reinvestment in internal and external opportunities that are aligned with our growth strategies and are expected to drive strong financial returns.","With that that let me ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our first quarter financials and outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar. As Omar mentioned our first quarter revenue of $7.390 billion represented an approximate 3% [Technical Difficulty] and approximately 4% on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency had a negative $33 million on first quarter revenue and tuck-in acquisitions completed almost a year ago contributed approximately 140 basis points to revenue growth, driven in part by the benefit gained from Medtronic ownership. Our revenue fell just shy of 4% growth by approximately $30 million on a total of $7.4 billion. When we updated our guidance in July, we expected our revenue would be slightly higher, but the IT disruption caused the unique dynamic affecting our visibility through quarter and as we worked to clear the order backlog including higher than expected sensor demand in diabetes. And as you know given the buying patterns of our customers we tend to have a larger amount of sales in the last few weeks of every quarter in some of our businesses.","Importantly as Omar mentioned the IT system disruption is behind us and we are seeing strong demand for our new technologies giving us confidence in our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year. In the quarter we delivered continued operating margin expansion and strong EPS leverage. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.74, non-GAAP was $1.12. After adjusting for the $0.02 negative impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 11%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 26.9% on a constant currency basis representing a year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points. With the impact of currency included our first quarter non-GAAP operating margin also improved increasing 10 basis points year-over-year.","Taking into account currency any the acquisitions that we have done in the past year, our operating margin improvement on an organic basis was approximately 70 basis points in the quarter. The operating margin improvement was driven by efficiencies as we continued to deliver on our Covidien synergies. This was partially offset by purposeful investments we are making in sales and marketing in the first half of the fiscal year to support new product launches. Net other expense which is included in our operating margin was $66 million compared to $39 million in the prior year and negatively affected our operating margin improvement by 30 basis points. The increase in net other expense was due in part to foreign exchange re-measurement and our hedging program which combined were $5 million loss in the quarter versus the $4 million gain in the prior year. Looking ahead we expect net other expense to be approximately $110 million per quarter and slightly higher than that in the second quarter. This includes approximately $30 million to $40 million per quarter of hedging expense based on recent exchange rates.","Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $194 million, slightly less than our original expectation as income earned on our cash investments helped to offset debt expense. Looking ahead, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $180 million to $200 million a quarter. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 13% and benefited from $47 million an operational tax adjustment that became evident and were communicated late in the quarter. Excluding these adjustments our non-GAAP nominal tax rate would have been 15.7%, in line with our expectations between 15.5% and 16.5% for the remainder of the year.","First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.376 billion shares. We repurchased a net $1.1 billion of our ordinary shares in the first quarter, executing the annual return commitment to shareholders, concluding our incremental $5 billion commitment announced in January 2016, and pulling forward some of our incremental $1 billion repurchase commitment from our divestiture to Cardinal Health given our lower stock price. We expect shares to continue to come down in Q2 and then stay roughly flat for the remainder of the year given our tendency to purchase shares earlier in the fiscal year.","In June, we increased our cash dividend by 7% making this our 40th consecutive year delivering a dividend increase. Combining our share repurchase activity with the $625 million we paid in dividends in the first quarter, our total payout ratio was 111% on non-GAAP net income and 169% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind, our payout ratio was elevated as we tend to execute the majority of our annually planned share repurchases early in the fiscal year.","Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to reiterate our annual guidance and updated with the completion of our divestiture to Cardinal Health, which occurred at the start of our second quarter. For fiscal year 2018, we expect comparable constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5%, which removes the divested revenue from the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2017 as well as the impact of currency. On a comparable basis, the divestiture is expected to result in more than a 30 basis point improvement given the partial year impact to our fiscal \u201818 revenue growth. This translates into a full year annualized recurring growth rate benefit of approximately 50 basis points as highlighted previously. While we recognized the divestiture as a positive impact to our guidance range, the current supply constraint in diabetes will continue to impact growth in that business until later this fiscal year.","Looking at revenue growth by our business group, for CVG, quarterly growth rates have typically been between 4% and 7% in recent years. Given the strength of its near-term pipeline and easing prior year comparison, we now expect CVG to grow in the upper half of its historical range for the full fiscal year. We expect CVG\u2019s growth to be strong in the second and third quarters before facing a difficult comparison in the fourth quarter. MITG has typically reported growth rates between 3% and 4% excluding the impact of acquisitions and the divestiture is expected to increase growth by about a point. In fiscal \u201818 given the partial year impact of the divestiture and lower growth in the first quarter, we now expect MITG to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. For RTG, quarterly growth have typically been in the 3% to 5% range in recent years, balancing strong growth in Brain Therapies against competitive challenges in pain therapies and a strengthening share position in a relatively flat spine market, we now expect full fiscal year growth for RTG to be at the low end of this historical range.","Finally, in our Diabetes Group, historical growth before the recent market disruptions was typically in the high single-digits to low double-digits. With the impact of the temporary supply constraint, we now expect diabetes to grow in the range of 1% to 4% this fiscal year, with improvement in the second half as we fulfill the new 670G to non-priority access customers in the third quarter and increased our sensor supply in the fourth quarter. While the growth acceleration has been delayed by a few quarters, we expect to enter fiscal year \u201819 with ultimate strong double-digit growth in diabetes.","Looking at the second quarter, we would expect to be in the lower half of our annual revenue growth range on a comparable constant currency basis with accelerating growth in CVG offset by a decline in diabetes in the high single-digits. Diabetes revenue is expected to temporarily decline sequentially before improving in the back half of the year for two reasons. First, we expect less deferred revenue recognition in the second quarter from our Priority Access Program as more pump shipments associated with this program occurred in the first quarter. Second while we will be able to fulfill new 670G customers after we fulfill the Priority Access customers. We anticipate that new sales will be muted until we can ultimately fulfill centers with pump. Only a limited amount of patients are likely to be willing to purchase the pump and wait for the sensors.","With regard to operating margin, we expect solid improvement in the fiscal year with greatest strength in the back half. We expect our gross margin on a comparable constant currency basis to be flat for the year with modest pricing pressure offset by operating improvement. SG&A as a percent of revenue is expected to improve particularly in the back half of the year as we continue to execute on margin expansion opportunities and enabling functions, transition to centers of excellence and optimize our distribution channel. With respect to earnings, we continue to expect fiscal \u201818 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9% to 10% on a comparable constant currency basis. For the second quarter, we would expect temporary year-over-year decline in our growth and operating margin leading to EPS growth flat to slightly up on a comparable constant currency basis. Given the continued investments we are making to support product launches, the impact of temporary revenue declines in diabetes and the operational tax benefits we received in the prior year that are not expected to repeat. However, we continue to expect EPS growth and operating margin expansion to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year.","While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast if recent exchange rate which included \u20ac1.18 and JPY109 remained stable for the fiscal year. Our full year revenue would be positively affected by approximately $380 million to $480 million including an approximate $25 million to $75 million tailwind in the second quarter. Full year EPS would be affected by approximately negative $0.03 to a positive $0.01 including a positive impact of approximately zero to $0.02 in the second quarter. Finally, regarding free cash flow, we continued to expect it to grow in the high single-digit compounded annually from fiscal \u201816 to \u201818 albeit now on a comparable basis given the divestiture.","To compare you should adjust for items that are considered part of the divestiture net proceeds like tax and transaction costs that affect free cash flow. These are expected to be approximately $400 million this fiscal year and $200 million next year. In addition, you should adjust for the loss of free cash flow generated by the divested businesses which was approximately $100 million per quarter. Without these adjustments free cash flow is expected to grow in the low single-digits compounded annually from fiscal year \u201816 to \u201818.","Now I will turn the call back Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Karen. And looking ahead to the remainder of our fiscal year we have confidence in our guidance and visibility into the acceleration in our innovation cycle as we see momentum coming from several new product launches this fiscal year. And let me remind you of a few them. In CVG we now have intermediate risk approval in TAVR and are launching our new revenue Evolut profile. We are also in the early stages of market launch for new Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent our micro transcatheter pacing system and or MR-Conditional Quadripolar CRT pacemaker in our largest global markets.","As we enter the back half of the fiscal year we expect to launch HVAD destination therapy and our next generation Azure [ph] wireless pacemaker family in the U.S. as well as the impact of to Admiral drug-coated balloon in Japan. In MITG as I mentioned earlier we are launching our Signia powered surgical stapling system and gearing up to release our surgical robot platform later this year. In RTG our product refresh in the spine continues and we are preparing to launch our Solera Voyager 5.5\/6.0 fixation system. We are also seeing great traction with our StealthStation S8 navigation system and our continued partnership with Mazor and their Mazor X system. And in our diabetes group in addition to ramping up the 670G hybrid closed loop launch, we are also preparing to launch our standalone CGM system Guardian Connect in the U.S. later this year which will be combined with our sugar IQ app that utilizes IBM Watson cognitive computing.","Let\u2019s now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen I will ask Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bryan Hanson, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question and if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call.","Operator, first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Thank you, guys and good morning everybody. I wanted to start with two questions. So, first, there appeared to be somewhat conflicting statements and I understand part of it is legality on the impact of the computer outage. So, could you try and quantify, because obviously there is a comment in your prepared remarks as well as the press release that says that was not material. So, can you try and quantify what the impact was this quarter? And then second, obviously there is going to be a focus on the diabetes business and the step down to the outlook for the year. So, can you just spend a little bit more time on what\u2019s going on with the sensors and why now we are looking at effectively a backlog all the way out to the fiscal fourth quarter versus previously fall? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Yes. Let me quickly address the diabetes one and then I will let Karen address the IT system question. From diabetes, look, what\u2019s happened is the \u2013 our success rate with our products, which all have now sensor attachment, has actually been very high not only with the 670G here in the U.S. but with also the 640G which we launched in Europe roughly 2 years ago and that plus the Guardian Connect in Europe has really gained traction. And what\u2019s happened is the demand for the sensor really grows by multiple factors compared to just pump revenue, because for every pump, you need to supply sensors for the whole year in an ongoing basis. And so when you do that demand equation, that number comes to be a very large number and although we are accelerating the plans to add a new line, it just takes a little longer than one would want. I think that\u2019s all I can say that the attachment rates are much higher than previously envisaged that even a short while ago we were planning the number of customers who want the priority access for the 670G is also significantly higher than we were expecting. All of this leads to a multiplication of the number of centers that are required and when you do the math, it just comes to a very large number, which we just can fulfill immediately. But having said that, these are all things that are in our control and we are pretty confident that by the end of the year will be \u2013 diabetes will be able to take advantage of these new products which actually we have been driving to and are pretty revolutionary in their own right. So, Karen, you want to say something on the IT?","Karen Parkhill","Yes, on the IT outage, it\u2019s very difficult to separate and quantify the impact related to the outage. We did say that it is not material to the first quarter revenue or earnings per share, so very difficult to quantify beyond that.","Mike Weinstein","Okay, alright. So, just two follow-ups, so one on the sensor side, it appears part of the problem is that as you are moving to a lower MARD, it\u2019s harder to manufacture the sensors, we all are aware of that, but just it sounds like the yields aren\u2019t as good and that the reliability in terms of the life of the sensors isn\u2019t as good, so you are having to include an extra sensor in the packets that we are shipping out. So, can you comment on that? And then just the other follow-up is the change in the MITG guidance, the increase was less than we were expecting post the divestiture and that part looks like to a weaker performance in general surgery this quarter. So, could you just comment on the MITG business effectively and say why didn\u2019t guidance move up more there given the divestiture and why was general surgery weak? Thanks. And I will let others jump in.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. First of all, with the diabetes, it is not an issue of yield at all. The yield is perfectly good and in line with our expectations and the number of sensors that are required are the standard number of sensors that we expect for patients to cycle through. So, that is really not the issue at all. We are extremely confident in our manufacturing, the process, the yields resulting in much more accurate sensor performance. And this is purely an issue of acquiring capital equipment that needs to be approved by the FDA and put in place. And when that happens we will release sensor capacity. This has got nothing to do with any yield differential of any or need for cycle these sensors any quicker than is normally expected?","Hooman Hakami","Yes. Mike the only thing I would just add to that if you really take a look at what Omar mentioned with respect to the dynamics this is purely a function of increased demand, not manufacturing output or manufactured performance. And maybe two statistics to keep in mind, you heard in the commentary our installed base demand for sensors in Europe was 50%. We were expecting growth in Europe, but 50% was more sensor utilization than what we were expecting. The second that you heard from the commentary is that there were 32,000 priority access patients that signed up that was a 30% increase versus what we expected. So this is purely a function of increased demand not as Omar pointed out of anything to do with yields or lower marks [ph]. Our marks are great, our yields are totally in line with expectation, it\u2019s just our ability to meet demand and this is a temporary thing.","Karen Parkhill","Keep in mind that our diabetes patients on 640G do not need to use the sensor attached. But they are choosing to use it more and more often because of the accuracy with that sensor. And that is one of the reasons that the demand was higher than we originally anticipated. In regard to MITG, we do expect revenue growth for the year now to be 3.5% to 4.5% and that does include the positive impact of the divestiture for the partial year of about 30 basis points. On a full year basis we would expect that to be about 50 basis points, so we are increasing our guidance in that business line.","Hooman Hakami","Thank you, Mike.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Mike. We will get the next question?","Operator","And from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just a couple of questions for me, the first is for Geoff and then maybe one for Omar. Geoff, just to talk about just RTG kind of broadly for a second, sort of a tale of two cities, the core spine numbers to us looked better actually, I wonder if you could talk about your share momentum in core spine relative to what we have seen which is industry weakness amounts most of your peers in spine and then of course offsetting that is SCS and TBS [ph] businesses just based on product cycle innovation are not doing as well and when do you think those businesses can begin to stabilize and why? Then I had a quick follow-up?","Geoff Martha","Yes. In the spine market look, we have seen a little bit of softness this last quarter. We had the spine market growing like 1% to 2% historically in the last two quarters Q3 and Q4 for us. We \u2013 Medtronic we were at 3% overall growth. We had the spine market, it\u2019s hard for us we are triangulating. We don\u2019t get market data for a couple of more weeks. But based on what we can see we have new market relatively flat maybe 0.5% growth. So that definitely had an impact on us this quarter. But we are still gaining share and we think it\u2019s on the strength of one our product releases and this whole methodology of launching them around speed to scale. And then our surgical synergies deals which I think will build momentum as we get continue to expand our partnership with Mazor. But right now over 5.5% in the U.S. of our core spine volume is tied in with these capital deals and that\u2019s a growing number. So the two factors that are driving the business once is just product releases and we will see that continue throughout the year. Second half we have a couple of new product releases coming and launching in the speed and scale manner and then combining them with the capital equipment. And that is obviously it when you look at as vis-\u00e0-vis the other multinationals we are performing quite a bit better. And on the pure plays I mean the gap is very \u2013 is narrow dramatically. And as we move forward with introducing robotics in the portfolio with Mazor ICS and plus our continued product launches in core spine I feel good about where we are and I see positive momentum. But you are right, that\u2019s been offset by pain stem in TBS. And pain stem has been declining in that mid single-digits, even little higher over the last couple of quarters and the catalyst for change there is going to be Intellis which we plan to launch in the back half of the calendar year. And Intellis will be the smallest implantable rechargeable system on the market 40% smaller than our current one with a state-of-the-art programmer. I mentioned it\u2019s rechargeable and it will be a fast recharge like 75% faster than our current and it\u2019s upgradable and you are right, but you are also able to download novel stim patterns and algorithms as we are investing in. And you combine that with our evolved work flow that we launched a few quarters ago, which is definitely helping us. I think that will stabilize that business. And then again, we are continuing to invest in novel stim patterns, which this Intellis platform we will be able to handle. And then DBS, that\u2019s going to take a little bit longer. I mean, we are funding that business in terms of our R&D, but it will be probably several quarters over a year before some of these new innovations come to market that we have talked about in terms of our new steerable leads, our new PC+S system and then a very novel cranial mounted rechargeable system. So, DBS is it a little bit further out and then we see Pain Stim when Intellis launch and the dynamic that\u2019s shifted as spine has gone up and Pain Stim has gone down, DBS was still performing. In this past quarter, it started to shrink a little bit as Boston got on the market in Europe with their MR compatible system.","David Lewis","Okay. Thanks, Geoff. And my two follow-ups, one for Bryan, I don\u2019t know if I caught the specific answer in MITG. It did look on the margin there is a little core softness in MITG across some of the major segments. I don\u2019t know if there is anything you will be willing to call out there? And then for Omar, now that you have closed the divestiture, can you just kind of level set us in terms of where we should be thinking about priorities of future free cash and the broader balance sheet and most specifically as it relates to buyback after you complete the $5 billion dollar program? And then just M&A, how investors should be thinking about your priorities here mid-tier, larger acquisitions or more smaller growth innovative deals?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. From a margin perspective in our business, I don\u2019t see anything with probably similar to the mix in the quarter, I don\u2019t see anything that would continue there. And just real quick on general surgery in a question was asked previously, it was a little lighter in the quarter likely due to surgical volumes. It reacts more to surgical volumes than our advanced energy business and advanced business overall. And so that\u2019s why we saw little bit of weakness in general surgery versus what we have seen in the past. It is almost directly impacted by these surgical volumes and that was the reason for the softness.","Omar Ishrak","And with respect to the questions for me, let me start with the acquisition strategy. Look, we remain focused on tuck-in acquisitions today and they worked for us. We have converted them into the ones that we have done. We are converting them quite smoothly into organic growth drivers for us over time. We are not really focused today on transformative M&A. Remember we are still in the last year of integration of Covidien. We just did a divestiture that is separation agreements that we have got to follow through. So, we are focused on executing these big sort of bets in many ways that we made. And we continue to have very disciplined approach to pursuing tuck-in acquisitions and we intend to continue with our approach. Over the long-term, we will continue to build value for shareholders and we look at opportunities that are accretive to margins and growth trajectories that support our strategic priorities. I think Karen can comment a little bit on the capital allocation perhaps on the buyback as well.","Karen Parkhill","Sure. As you have heard us talk about in the past time, we are focused on paying back to our shareholders in the form of those dividends and share purchases and that won\u2019t change. We are also focused on balancing that payback with continued reinvestment in our own business, so that we can continue to grow that long-term value of Medtronic.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thank you, David. Darla, can we have the next question please?","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks and good morning.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning.","Bob Hopkins","I just wanted to ask two questions that really sort of clarify the guidance maybe. And Karen to start out this is pretty simple math, but just to confirm the new EPS guidance for fiscal 2018 including Cardinal by my math based on your new disclosure it sums to about 475 to 480 is that correct?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. We don\u2019t comment directly on exact EPS guidance. But we do expect \u2013 continue to expect 9% to 10% growth on the base of last year. So hopefully, that\u2019s helpful.","Bob Hopkins","Well, obviously, you give all the moving pieces in your disclosures and I just wanted to make sure that we had that right, but I guess we can follow-up offline on that, but our math tend to run 475 to 480 and I guess the other EPS clarifying question that I had was it I am just trying to reconcile the old guidance to the new guidance and understand maybe what has changed I know you are now giving your growth targets off of pro forma numbers, but I mean your old guidance called for 9% to 10% underlying EPS growth on legacy Medtronic and then $0.05 to $0.10 hit and then you said Cardinal will dilutive by $0.18, those are the three sort of big pieces to your old guidance and I am just curious could you help us understand what\u2019s changed with this new guidance, obviously we can see that FX has gotten better, but as I sum through all the matter it seems like something must have gotten a little bit worse either the Cardinal dilution or maybe the base business due to other income or diabetes so I am just trying to understand what\u2019s changed relative to the old guidance you never used to give it?","Karen Parkhill","Sure. I would say that the biggest thing that\u2019s changed is in our diabetes business and the impact of the lower revenue growth until the end of the fiscal year given the demand and supply constraints and that guidance does ultimately have an impact through the P&L. And so that does also affect the bottom line. Beyond that we do expect that to be offset by some better guidance in CVG than initially given. Given the strength of that new pipeline and on an EPS perspective, we do expect that the dilutive impact of the transaction is still $0.18 on a net basis after taking into account the use of proceeds on a gross basis when you are looking at the numbers that we provide to reset your base on a gross basis that would translate into about $0.23 dilutive before taking into account these proceeds.","Bob Hopkins","And do you have a number that quantifies the impact of the diabetes change in guidance for this particular quarter what the impact was on organic growth?","Karen Parkhill","I would say that again difficult to give you an exact dollar amount of the impact to the quarter of the demand and supply equation. But clearly it did impact us to perform under what we had initially guided for the diabetes business last quarter.","Bob Hopkins","Okay, thank you very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Bob. Next question?","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, guys. How are you?","Omar Ishrak","Good Kristen.","Kristen Stewart","I have missed you all. I guess I have just a couple of more strategic questions and I just want to clarify just on diabetes it sounds like the demand is just more overwhelmingly positive, has this changed your mind from a strategic perspective \u2013 I am sorry for the background, just in terms of wanting to change your thoughts on going more from a consumer level because you have 30% more demand for like using 640G with the sensors why not think about going more just to our base business not going more the professional route?","Omar Ishrak","This for central\u2026","Hooman Hakami","So Kristen hi, this is Hooman, nice to hear your voice. The \u2013 let me just touch on that. First of all it is as we talked about purely a demand equation. And as you rightly pointed out, we have Enlite 1 sensor, our Enlite enhanced sensor, our Guardian Sensor 3. All of those are experiencing strong demand which as Omar and Karen mentioned we are working to fill the capacity in order to meet that demand. It doesn\u2019t change our strategy overall, number one. So strategically actually this increased demand means the strategy is working. With respect to sensor augmented systems and then as far as personal versus professional CGM, I would say two things. One as Karen and Omar alluded to in the commentary we are still working with the FDA for the launch of our own personal CGM which should hopefully happen in this year. The Guardian Connect sensor with sugar IQ, that\u2019s number one and on top of that we continue to go down the path within our non-intensive type 2 business to drive professional CGM more aggressively through primary care physicians. So we are pursuing all three of these angles and that\u2019s been the strategy and we will continue to try that strategy.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, great, awesome. And so with the FDA just getting new lines of that just was causing more of the delay and causing the backup in demand, not I think you are pretty strong in saying Omar it\u2019s not yield?","Omar Ishrak","Correct.","Hooman Hakami","It\u2019s not deal, it\u2019s capacity just to meet the demand.","Kristen Stewart","It\u2019s not the [indiscernible] of product and just the demand and getting more lines cleared by the FDA. Okay, perfect, that\u2019s clear. Okay. And then Omar, I am just curious on your thoughts of the recent FDA decision to kind of pull back on some of the bundled payments in terms of where care is going and the need to reduce care, but I am just curious on your thinking on whether this changes ultimately strategy and how you think about things going forward and then also just comments strategically on you there has been more consolidation in the industry, your thoughts competitively where you are stacking up and especially in light of the divestiture to kind of the evolution of Medtronic and where you are positioned now?","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thanks Kristen. First of all this year measurement it would be with the payment changes. The changes really that is not mandatory anymore. I think there is general encouragement to move more towards value based payments. And I think it\u2019s not only CMS but the commercial payers are also looking at it in that dimension. At the end of the day the value based healthcare is around improving outcomes at a lower cost. And I think that the trajectory is not going to change. I think is good realization of that. I think operationalizing this requires granular work and we are in the middle of that and we are driving that partnering with both providers and payers and CMS in doing so as we come up with the right models. So I would say that the change from the mandatory version is just that, it is not mandatory anymore. There is no real change in philosophy about the value of bundle payments and the importance of outcomes measurements. I think with respect to the industry value based care is where they industry has got to move to. Consolidation gives you a capability to have a seat at the table. It gives you more assets to use to deliver value based healthcare, because you probably need a variety of capabilities to do so. But at the end of the day, innovation in this industry that\u2019s relevant for patients is never going to go away. And let\u2019s not confuse getting broader in some ways with lack of focus in specific physician partnerships and therefore driving innovation which will then result in the higher value that\u2019s what MedTech does. And that is not going to go away.","Hooman Hakami","Grea. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thank you, Kristen. Next question please.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me just follow-up on the question that was asked earlier about weak U.S. surgical volumes and in the spine market, overall calendar Q2 was pretty mix with the large cap MedTech companies and with growth slowing, so I wanted to see if you guys could talk about why you think U.S. surgical volumes might have been weak maybe any inside on trends in July and August and why you think the spine market might be a little soft? And then I had a follow-up. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","I think there is two things on that, first of all always remember that the U.S. market is driven by innovation cycles. And as we go through our innovation cycles, the underlying market is really dominated by these growth spikes that as we get. And as we move into an accelerating phase of innovation you will see our U.S. almost go up. With respect to the underlying market there is a slight change which is in the range of changes that have happened in the past and you are right that surgical volumes overall have been a little softer as have spinal volumes. A lot of this has to do it electric procedures, people backing away from those. I think that\u2019s the best that I think that we have seen that there has been an intentional sort of conservatism if you like maybe a caution about their elective procedures right down the middle of the year. But again, it\u2019s within the range of movement of these markets over time. So, it\u2019s not anything beyond that. And I do think that innovation cycles are the ones that really moved these markets much more dramatically. And I think as we go through this period of accelerating innovation, you are going to see that.","Larry Biegelsen","Any commentary on the spine softness, is that also procedure related? And just for my follow-up, maybe, Mike, there is a couple of presentations coming up at ESC that could impact your AFib business, CASTLE AF as well as renal denervation, the SPYRAL OFF MED trial. Could you talk about significance of those trials and any other color you might be able to add before the data? Thanks.","Mike Coyle","Larry, on the spine market, I just \u2013 I do attribute it to what Omar was talking about these broader themes around elective procedures. A little more specifics we can rule out a few themes. I mean, we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 we do have some visibility in the payers and we haven\u2019t seen any increased pushback from payers, any increase like declines of procedures, because we do review insight into that. We haven\u2019t seen that. And then just talking to physicians, we haven\u2019t seen any other significant catalyst. They still seem pretty positive about the market. And so at this point, again like I mentioned earlier, we will get more procedural insights in a couple of weeks, because the market data has delayed a little bit, the data that we get. But at this point, we are attributing it to the broader elective procedure dynamics that Omar mentioned.","Omar Ishrak","And then Larry on the questions about the clinical trials to come up here at ESC for late-breaking clinical trials, I don\u2019t have much to say on the CASTLE AF study until we actually see the results there. Obviously, our franchises are doing very well in that particular area both therapeutically with the cryoablation and continuing benefits from the FIRE and ICE study as well as obviously continued growth in the insertable loop recorder market, where frankly most of the growth that we see there is being dominated by its use in cryptogenic stroke and syncope. So, we don\u2019t expect those to be particularly impacted, but we will wait and see what those data are. As it relates to the renal denervation, obviously we have been working now for better part 3 years to basically look at the application of that therapy. We have changed the device obviously to the spiral device. We have changed where we are doing the application of energy to go more distal into the renal artery. We have changed the patient population that we are studying based on the evidence that we saw of who responded and who didn\u2019t in the original HTN-3 study. And we also have obviously now executed on randomized clinical trial, sham-controlled for the both on and off, on-med and off-med arms and what\u2019s going to be presented at ESC next week is the off-med patient cohort there. So, we think that\u2019s probably the purest look at the therapeutic value of renal denervation. There will be simultaneous publication for that and we will discuss those results after they are actually presented at ESC.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Larry. Next question, please Darla.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Hi, good morning guys. I just want to ask one more question on surgical volume, so we get it spine volumes in the U.S. were slower in 2Q and there was some softness in general surgical trends in 2Q, but can you give us your expectations for the second half of this calendar year. And the reason I am asking is because one of things we have heard is that these higher \u2013 lower premium higher deductible plans are starting to push more and more cases into the fourth quarter similar to what we see in knees and hips. So, is that a possible explanation as to why we saw some softness in 2Q and is that a reason for volumes to get stronger in the back end? So I am just wanting your thoughts on that? And then I just had a follow-up question for Mike Coyle.","Omar Ishrak","Okay, Bryan, why don\u2019t you take that?","Bryan Hanson","Yes. So, what I would tell you is that thinking in Q2 we get \u2013 it\u2019s not a perfect science by the way. And so if you look at the variables that would drive the lower surgical volumes in a quarter it\u2019s very difficult to say what variable actually had the biggest impact. So, I don\u2019t want to draw any conclusions there. What I know is that from our own field sales organization from some of our key competitors that plan to space in their general surgery type products if there was softness in the quarter. I don\u2019t want to read too much into that though, because it\u2019s one quarter. We have quarters that are up \u2013 quarters that are down, so I am calling this a trend at all at this point. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to draw any conclusions to any strength that would be happening in the fourth quarter as result of this. One other thing I would mention in our Advanced Surgical business though we always look at surgical volumes, one of the key things we concentrate on is moving current procedures from open to MIS and that drives a lot of our growth. So, we are definite on surgical volumes, but not completely dependent on surgical volumes in that business.","Glenn Novarro","Okay. And then, Mike, just two cardio questions, one maybe a little bit more color on what you are seeing in your core piecing business today given Abbott is now launched an MRI safe pacer and then you are bullish on your spend outlook over the next couple of quarters with the Onyx launch, but maybe talk about what\u2019s truly different about Onyx that could allow you to gain share in the stent market over the next, I don\u2019t know, 6 to 12 months? Thanks.","Mike Coyle","Sure. On the pacing side, the market is very stable. We are seeing low single-digit to actually mid single-digit unit growth for initial implants. And obviously, we have seen some modest share loss to competitors as they have entered with MRI. But as that now we have brought out Micra both in the U.S. and Europe and we will be coming to Japan this quarter. We are obviously seeing recapture of especially the single chamber unit share at much higher prices obviously with the micro product. And as we head into the second half of this year, we will be releasing our next generation of pacing family, the Azure wireless pacer family both in Europe and in the United States. It\u2019s actually just been released in Europe and will be coming to the United States in the second half. So, we think we will actually get back into a share capture mode with that particular product. And then as it relates to the Onyx product, the feedback we have received from Europe and it\u2019s early release here in the U.S. and also in Japan is that it\u2019s the most deliverable stent in the market that it has the widest range of sizes and widths of any product that it basically can go anywhere and has great visibility. And we have seen it drive market share for us meaningfully in Europe to the point where we essentially recovered everything that had been given up as competitors are coming with their product. So, we are looking for a similar dynamic here in the U.S. and in Japan. And so we think we have obviously begun to see that. We are seeking a price premium for the product, which makes it a little slower in its ramp in terms of having to get approvals and committees to go on contract, but we are very encouraged with the feedback that we are receiving and we expect it to be a growth driver for us for the rest of the year.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. Thanks Mike.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matt Taylor","Hi, thank you for taking the question. I guess, it\u2019s the biggest change here. I just wanted to ask one follow-up on diabetes. As you are moving towards getting this new line up and running and adding that capacity, I guess can you help us understand what the gating factors are in terms of predicting that timing or what the bottlenecks could be with setting up that new line and what could push that timeline backward or forward if there is some conservatism in that guidance?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. I think look the major variable here is just the FDA approval that we need for the capital equipment that\u2019s needed for the line. The rest of it is pretty straightforward. We are replicating a line, a process that we know how to do. And there is some level of things out of our control is the FDA time cycle for approval. It\u2019s not anything that\u2019s different from what we have got approved in the past and we expect this to go okay, but it is something that\u2019s out of our control. And I think that\u2019s the major factor in getting the lineup. Is there anything else from that?","Hooman Hakami","No, that\u2019s exactly right. We know the equipment. We know the process. So bringing the equipment in doing all of the qualifications that\u2019s something we feel very comfortable with. Then there is obviously the variable of turning all of that over to the FDA and seeking their approval. So as Omar pointed out, that\u2019s the single biggest variable in this that has uncertainty around it, the other elements we feel very good about.","Omar Ishrak","And just to make it clear, we have gotten approval for this kind of stuff from the FDA in the past without any issue. So, there is nothing that\u2019s any different, but it is something that needs approval.","Matt Taylor","Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up on the presentation I noticed that CRT-D has actually declined low double-digits this quarter. So, I was curious if you could give us some color on that? I was a little surprise by the magnitude of that decline and if anything could change there, going forward to improve that?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. The decline that you are seeing in the CRT-D is basically being driven by the U.S. and it is basically we are seeing low single-digit declines in initial implants for CRT-D. We are actually taking market share in the initial implants, but we are also now seeing sort of the low double low double-digit declines in replacements. This is something we talked about a year ago in Q1 and Q2 as a competitor who had a major recall at the end of our Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. That obviously drove competitive replacements for us, which masked if you will that decline that\u2019s really being driven by the extending of battery life in the CRT-D space. And that\u2019s what you are seeing sort of reflected in the numbers. The other major driver for that which is temporary to the Q1 results is that we saw fairly significant destocking of hospital held inventory in the United States in Q1, where essentially the hospitals are looking not to hold this much inventory of product and if they want to take it, they want significant discounts to restock that, which we have opted not to do. So, that is more of a temporary issue that what we think will not see this big of a magnitude of it going forward.","Matt Taylor","Great. Thanks a lot for the color. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Next question please, Darla.","Operator","It\u2019s from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much for taking my question. To me shift a little bit to the land of robotics, you have a new surgical robotics expected outside the United States this year and you mentioned Mazor in your comments. Could you please give us an update on your thinking about those two aspects of your portfolio?","Omar Ishrak","I will let Bryan go first and then let Geoff talk about Mazor?","Bryan Hanson","I couldn\u2019t hear you very well. What was the question on the surgical robotic system?","Joanne Wuensch","Just an update on how you are thinking about the launch applications and differentiations and anything else you could add to the color of as we look towards that?","Bryan Hanson","Well, obviously, we are pretty excited that we are in the fiscal year that we are going to get the first human use. So, that\u2019s a positive. We are in the \u2013 what I would define is the pilot phase build right now and we are obviously working very diligently for verification and validation and also any things that we need to put together for regulatory submissions. So, we are heading down the path, feel confident with what we have today. Obviously, with this complex of a product, a lot can happen in the VNV process, but we are feeling good about where we stand today. In the strategy, it\u2019s the same that I have mentioned before organization from a mission perspective is to move our patients from open surgery to MIS. This is another tool to ensure that we can do that. And we feel confident that once we have launched this, we are going to be in a unique position to bring more value than any other company in the world. We will be able to fully service open surgical procedures, traditional MIS procedures and robotic surgery as well as provide operational efficiency services within the operating room. So, we remain very confident in the product and we remain very confident in the overall strategy.","Geoff Martha","And then this is Geoff on Mazor, as I think most people know, it\u2019s public, it\u2019s out there is our relationship with them has a continuum if you will and we are in this phase of the relationship is a lead sharing then if we hit certain milestones and they hit certain milestones, we move to more of a distribution. And the initial phase has gone very well. It\u2019s tested the hypothesis that we believe robotics has a strong place in spine surgery and it works well with our broader solutions around intraoperative imaging and navigation. And so we are very pleased with where the relationship is going. And I think we can talk more about this in the next quarter here in terms of moving towards distribution. In addition to that, a go forward look on tighter product integration with our navigation and intraoperative imaging systems as well as our spine implant business how this impacts their product roadmap as well, but the relationship continues to go well. It\u2019s growing. Our customers see a lot of value and not just the robot, but the robot \u2013 Mazor X robot used in conjunction with our intraoperative imaging system the O-arm 2 as well as our navigation platform StealthStation.","Joanne Wuensch","Okay. Most of my questions have been answered. Thank you very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Joanne. Will take one more question please.","Operator","And your final question will be from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","Thanks for letting me in [ph] guys. I appreciate it. Want to spend a minute talking about the nature of your relationship with hospitals. There are couple of items here that have been brought upon that I thought are interesting, one was just the nature of surgical procedures and I am wondering if you are seeing any impact from the increase in prior authorization required by hospitals and payers before scheduling procedures, whether that\u2019s having an impact on volumes in spine and elsewhere in your business?","Omar Ishrak","Look we don\u2019t have any direct insight into that. We don\u2019t hear of that as a specific reason. And like I said this range is within a fluctuation range that we have seen before. So we are gauging it in that light. And like we mentioned earlier electric procedures probably down a little bit, but again in the ranges we have seen before. And again let me emphasize that product innovation in this market is what really swings these markets. And we do think that for the right procedures where there is real value that the patient can see and the physicians can see the procedures that happen and they will grow when new innovation comes along. And we are in a period of accelerating that innovation, so we do expect our U.S. growth numbers to go up in the coming quarters, offset a little bit by the diabetes slowdown in the next quarter or so because that\u2019s mostly \u2013 almost all U.S. But really surgical procedures themselves I think again are in the range of history, historical trends. And we expect our product innovation to positively impact those markets.","Isaac Ro","Okay. It\u2019s helpful. Maybe just from another direction I think there was an earlier comment on the CRT-D business with regards to hospital inventory, are you seeing at a higher level any change in the way hospitals manage their inventory for your products, I mean it seems like again that customer group is a little bit stretch in terms of their financial health and so just understanding how they are managing their cash flow and how that impacts you?","Omar Ishrak","Well, I think the methodology for managing is more or less the same as it\u2019s always been and you go through these cycles again in the range that we have seen before. And look I hear too from hospitals just in general that they are concerned about their business flow. But again it\u2019s nothing that\u2019s more than what we have seen before and in that range. And for the right think they will do it. But their buying patterns are in line with what we have seen, nothing dramatically different.","Isaac Ro","Okay. Thank you very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thank you, Isaac. Okay. So with that, let me thank you all for your questions and on behalf of the entire management team I would like to thank you again for your support and interest in Medtronic. And we look forward to updating you on our progress on our second quarter earnings call which we now anticipate holding on November 28 which is a week later than normal closing time needed as a result of the divestiture of the Cardinal Health.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead sir.","Jeff Warren","Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2015 first quarter which ended July 25, 2014. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Also, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis. And finally, today\u2019s earnings call does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or solicitation of any vote or approval.","In connection with the proposed Covidien transaction, Medtronic Holdings Limited has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary joint proxy statement of Medtronic Inc. and Covidien plc that also constitutes our preliminary perspectives of new Medtronic. The registration statement is not complete and will be further amended. After the registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC, the final joint proxy statement perspectives will be mailed to Medtronic shareholders and Covidien shareholders. You should review materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information about regarding post transaction including information about Medtronic and Covidien, the respective directors, executive officers and certain other members of management and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxy in favor of the proposed transaction.","Please also review the disclaimer page at globalmedtechleader.com for additional information on forward-looking statements and other important information on the proposed transaction. With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak ","Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported first quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, which represents growth of 4% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93, growing 6%. Our Q1 revenue growth is in the middle of our outlook range for the year and within our mid-single-digit baseline goal. Our overall organization again delivered balanced growth with strong performances in some areas offsetting challenges in other parts of our business. Significant this quarter was our performance in the U.S. where we grew 6%, the highest growth in this region for five years. We believe mid-single-digit growth in the U.S. can be sustained over the coming quarters based on the momentum of our new products.","Therapy innovation contributed over half of our global growth this quarter. When combined with our focus on globalization and economic value, further enhanced by our pending acquisition of Covidien, we are well positioned to further improve our competitive position and long-term growth profile. As we have done previously, we intend to quantify, communicate, and execute in each of our independent growth vectors. Our new therapies growth vector contributed 200 basis points to our overall growth in Q1, which was well within our previously stated expectations of 150 basis points to 350 basis points. ","As I mentioned earlier, execution on several key new product launches helped drive growth this quarter. And looking ahead, we believe our robust pipeline will contribute significantly to our future growth. ","Starting with the cardiac and vascular group, our Reveal LINQ miniaturized cardiac diagnostic monitor along with strong above-market performance in AF Solutions are driving clear growth acceleration. This helps propel our cardiac rhythm and heart failure business to 4% growth, a level of performance that we have generally not seen since the core implantables markets slowed down four years ago.","Over the past few years, the cardiac rhythm and heart failure team has systematically executed on a strategic plan delivering multiple new attractive growth drivers, including AF and heart failure management products and services, predictive diagnostics and deep miniaturization technologies. All of these growth drivers are clearly resonating in the marketplace more than offsetting pricing pressures in the more mature parts of the business.","Another highlight in Q1 was the strong execution by our structural heart team on the ongoing U.S. launch of CoreValve transcatheter valve. With the patent dispute behind us, our team is now laser focused on what really matters ensuring more patients have access to this life-saving therapy. The early results have exceeded expectations as we have been aggressively opening new accounts and have captured over 40% of the U.S. market in just two quarters of launching CoreValve. ","Looking ahead in our Cardiac and Vascular group, we will launch our recently approved Attain Performa quadripolar lead system in the U.S. in the next few weeks, which coupled with our proven AdaptiveCRT algorithm, is expected to improve while U.S. High Power share as it already has in Europe and Japan. We also continue to make progress in a number of other meaningful products in our pipeline, including our SEEQ cardiac diagnostic patch, CoreValve Evolut R Transcatheter Valve, Resolute Onyx drug eluting stent, IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon, and Micra leadless pacemaker. It is worth noting that in Q1, we realigned our four CVG businesses into three business units organized around disease states with a specific focus on comprehensive disease management. ","These changes allow us to better capitalize on important trends in our global markets, including the general trend among global reimbursement models to focus increasingly on disease outcomes versus discrete episodes of care, the growing importance of longitudinal patient management in the cardiac rhythm and heart failure space, the increasing level of collaboration between physician specialties and the newly formed heart teams in the coronary and structural heart market, and finally the growing focus on new technologies for peripheral vascular disease management in the aortic and peripheral market. ","Turning now to our Restorative Therapies group, strong growth in neuromodulation and solid performance of surgical technologies offset modest decline in spine. In neuromodulation, the RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system and Activa DBS system continued to drive growth. We also saw resurgence of growth in Gastro\/Uro due to improved procedure volumes. ","In surgical technologies, our team has balanced performance across ENT, Neurosurgery, and Advanced Energy. We are excited about the recently launched NuVent sinus balloon system. NuVent marks our first entry into the attractive sinus balloon dilation market, and we expect it to steadily take share in what is currently a $200 million opportunity. We also strengthened the breadth of our neurosurgical portfolio through the acquisition of Visualase last month. Visualase\u2019s MRI guided laser ablation technology is an important addition to our portfolio of therapies for neurosurgeons and broadens our overall market leading RTG neuroscience portfolio.","In spine, while revenue declined 3%, we believe factors weighing on Q1 were temporary and our plan to return to growth in FY15 remains on track. Spine\u2019s overall performance in Q1 was primarily affected by U.S. core spine which faced short-term pressure from inventory rebalancing and the timing of new product launches. In addition to our recently approved PRESTIGE LP artificial cervical disc, we are expecting to completely refresh our anterior cervical plate portfolio and launch new interbodies with advanced materials and functionality over the coming quarters. Our spine performance was also affected by year-over-year decline in BMP. However, we have not seen four quarters of sequential stability and underlying demand for BMP, which should provide easier comparisons starting in Q2. ","In diabetes, the strong U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system with Enlite is driving solid double-digit growth in both insulin pumps and CGM. Our focus in selling and supporting the pump and sensor as an integrated system is translating into global share gains in insulin pumps and U.S. share gains in CGM. The MiniMed 530G is the only system in the market that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step towards our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our threshold suspend feature including publications in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Looking ahead, we are preparing to launch the MiniMed 640G and MiniMed 620G in international markets in Q2. ","Our next growth vector, emerging markets contributed 130 basis points to our overall Company growth, which fell 20 basis points short of our minimum 150 basis points expectations. The main issues this quarter were in China and India. Our Greater China region grew 6% as we dealt with some near term challenges in the distributed channel and management changes. We expect China to quickly return to double-digit growth for the remainder of the fiscal year. India also had a difficult quarter declining 7% as we face disruption from distributor terminations and inventory rebalancing. We\u2019re executing a definite plan for optimizing our India distributor channels, but this will take the remainder of the fiscal year before we return to double-digit growth. In both India and China, we are developing direct partnerships with healthcare providers of all sizes. In the long term, this will result in the highest levels of business conduct standards, give us more direct contact with our end customers, and unlock significant margins.","While India and China fell below expectations, our Middle East and Africa region continues to be an impressive source of emerging market growth with the result up 30% in Q1. We have a strong strategic plan in EMEA executing on both large tender wins as well as Channel optimization opportunities. Latin America also had a good Q1 with strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Columbia and Mexico. And in our Central and Eastern Europe region we were encouraged to see that Russia return to growth in Q1. ","Despite the short term challenges in certain regions, we remain confident and enthusiastic in the long term outlook of emerging markets. We continue to focus in developing new public-private partnerships. For example, I was recently in China finalizing an agreement with a large sub-province. Over the past nine months, we met frequently with local government officials there, quickly aligning around the need to dramatically increase access to Hemodialysis therapy. Our discussions resulted in the comprehensive partnerships whereby we will manufacture Medtronic Hemodialysis products locally in return for manufacturing and commercial incentives including guaranteed purchases and support for accelerated regulatory approvals.","As we execute in these public and private partnerships, as well as market development and channel optimization strategies, we expect our emerging market growth to steadily improve and consistently contribute to 150 basis points to 200 basis points to our overall growth.","Finally, services solutions are third growth factor, contributed 50 basis points to our overall growth which is within the 40 basis points to 60 basis points annual range that we have targeted. Our Cath Lab Managed services business continues to grow in Europe with numerous long term contract representing over $0.5 million of revenue. We continue to grow this business both within Europe and in other regions around the world and are in discussions with an additional 150 healthcare systems. Our Cardiocom business also continues to deliver strong results, driven in part by growth of over 50% in patient access support services for providers. We view Cardiocom as an important healthcare services platform to deliver comprehensive integrated care solutions in the future.","Turning to the P&L, we made appropriate business trade outs in Q1 to deliver on the bottom line. Non-GAAP EPS growth was approximately 200 basis points above our revenue growth in line with our targeted expectations. In addition, we delivered $1 billion of free cash flow in Q1 after adjusting for certain litigation payments. And we increased our dividend by 9%. We remain focused in reliably delivering on our base line financial model, mid-single digit revenue growth, EPS growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than revenue growth and returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. To achieve these goals, we\u2019ve continued to execute on our three primary strategies; therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value.","We believe the Covidien acquisition will accelerate these strategies, bolstering our long term market competitiveness as well as the sustainability and consistency of our financial performance. In therapy innovation, Covidien\u2019s impressive array of industry leading products enhances our existing portfolio, offers greater breadth across clinical areas and create exciting entry points into promising new diagnostic therapies. ","We believe Medtronic\u2019s deep clinical regulatory reimbursement and market development expertise will help accelerate the rapid adoption in markets around the world. Our globalization strategy will also benefit from the power of our combined companies. From a financial perspective, we will have a $3.7 billion emerging markets business that we are confident can sustain double-digit growth over an extended period of time. Covidien has extensive emerging market R&D and manufacturing while Medtronic has well established clinical expertise. These capabilities applied across a much broader product offering will significantly increase the number of attractive solutions that we can offer to governments and major providers.","Finally, this transaction enhances Medtronic\u2019s ability to deliver economic value to a broader range of stakeholders. The value proposition of Covidien\u2019s technologies primarily delivers hospital efficiency. While the value of Medtronic\u2019s chronic disease therapies are generally realized in post-acute settings. When combined, these complementary solutions will create a robust and unmatched integrated health franchise. We feel that our industry leading products, clinical economic expertise, global footprint and financial strength will position us to be the preferred partner for physicians, hospital systems, patients, payers and governments around the world. In addition to being highly strategic, the Covidien acquisition is also extremely attractive financial with achievable cost synergies that are expected to make the transaction accretive in the first year on a cash basis and within two years on a GAAP basis. The combined company will also generate significant free cash flow which can be deployed with much greater flexibility. ","While there has been a lot of media and political noise about inversions, let me clarify that when the transaction closes, Medtronic will continue to pay significant U.S. taxes and increase our investments in the U.S. On taxes we will continue to pay federal, state and local income taxes on all U.S. earnings as well as our social security taxes, property taxes and the medical device tax. Cumulatively, these taxes represent more than 45% of U.S. income and we expect to pay a similar rate post close.","In addition, this transaction will put us in an even playing field with foreign companies regarding use of internationally generated profits. This structure will allow us to invest much more aggressively in the U.S. and based on that we have committed to investing in incremental $10 million over the next 10 years. These investments will result in more high-paying U.S. job. We have a proven track record of creating U.S. jobs with our past acquisitions. For example, with Sofamor Danek, AVE and MiniMed, we have created nearly 10,000 U.S. jobs since acquisition. More recently with Cardiocom, we have more than doubled the work force in just 12 months. We also expect additional job creation with our recently completed acquisitions of Visualase and Corventis, two U.S. based companies. ","Our level of U.S. job creation will only accelerate following this transaction. In our view, acquiring Covidien is good for Medtronic, for our shareholders, for patients and for the med-tech industry and ultimately good for the U.S. economy. We remain fully committed to the Covidien transaction which we expect to close in calendar fourth quarter of 2014 or early 2015. Our integration planning efforts are well underway led by Geoff Martha who is reporting directly to me. The integration team is staffed with top talent from both Covidien and Medtronic and they are actively developing our comprehensive integration planning. In the end, we understand the success of this transaction will depend on our ability to execute this integration plan upon closure.","Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our quarterly results. Gary?","Gary Ellis","","Thanks, Omar. First quarter revenue of $4.273 billion increased 5% as reported or 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $34 million favorable impact of foreign currency. Q1 revenue results by region were as follows; Growth in the Middle East and Africa was 30%; Latin American grew 14%; Growth in U.S. was 6%; Greater China grew 6%; Growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 5%; Other Asia Pacific group 4%; with Western Europe and Canada region declining 2%; Japan declined 5% and South Asia declined 7%. Emerging markets grew a combined 11% in Q1 and represented 13% of our total sales mix. It is worth noting that results in Western Europe were negatively affected by our difficult comparison in Germany where customers made advanced purchases of CoreValve product in Q1 last fiscal year in anticipation of the since resolved CoreValve injunction.","Japan\u2019s performance was also affected by difficult comparisons from strong product launches in the prior year as well as the biennial R zone adjustments. Q1 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.93, an increase of 6%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.87, a decrease of 6%, driven primarily by the favorable change in fair value of contingent consideration payments in the prior year. This quarter\u2019s GAAP to non-GAAP pretax adjustments included a $30 million net restructuring charge, the final charge related to the initiative we announced last quarter and a $41 million charge for acquisition related items primarily associated with transaction cost in connection with the pending Covidien acquisition.","It is worth noting that on a cash basis, Q1 diluted earnings per share were $0.99, an increase of 5%. In our cardiac and vascular group, revenue of $2.254 billion grew 3%, results were driven by growth in low power, structural heart, aortic and peripheral and AF and other partially offset by declines in high power and coronary. In Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure formerly known as CRDM, revenue of $1.256 billion grew 4% and included $19 million of combined revenue from our Q2 acquisition of Cardiocom and Q3 acquisition of TYRX. High power revenue of $627 million declined 5%. As we have noted over the last several quarters, we believe the best way to view the high and low power markets is on a rolling two quarter basis given the variability and quarter-to-quarter dynamics.","We estimate that the global high power market growth profile is flat to slightly down with low single digit-growth in international markets offsetting low single-digit declines in the U.S. We estimate we gained about a 1 point of international market share on a rolling two quarter sequential basis, driven by the success of our Attain Performa quadripolar CRT-D lead system which was offset by CRT-D share loss in the U.S. Our U.S. growth is also affected by difficult comparisons given where we are in our high power replacement cycle. ","Going forward, we expect our U.S. High Power performance to improve as we launch the recently approved d Attain Performa system into the U.S. market during Q2. This system was differentiated AdaptiveCRT algorithm has performed very well in international markets. In fact the markets where we have launched the Attain Performa system are CRT-D share is up a 160 basis points.","Low Power revenue of $525 million up 10% driven by the strong global launch of ","Reveal LINQ in our diagnostics business. In June, data from the CRYSTAL AF trial were published in the New England Journal, which showed our Reveal monitor detected AF better compared to our standard care in patients with recent cryptogenic strokes. ","We continue to make progress on our global clinical trial for Micra. And expect CE mark by the end of this fiscal year with U.S. approval to follow in FY \u201917. Micra, the world\u2019s smallest leadless pacemaker is a true innovation in pacing and features a novel delivery in fixation mechanism specifically designed for this new approach to prevent perforation and dislodgement while still permitting repositioning in capsule retrieval.","Recently, at Cardiostim, one and three-month data were presented on the first patients to receive Micra showing successful implants in all patients with no major post-implant device related complications.","AF solutions grew over 30% as we continue to gain share in the AF market. Results were driven by robust growth of the Arctic Front Advance CryoAblation system which grew over 30% as well as strong double-digit growth from the international launch of our PVAC Gold Phased RF System. We continue to enroll VICTORY AF, our U.S. pivotal study of phased RF technologies in patients with persistent AF. ","In our coronary and structural heart business which is the consolidated legacy coronary and structural heart business unites revenue of $766 million grew 1%. Coronary declined 2% although this performance was above market driven by 2% growth in drug eluting stents on the continued strength of our Resolute Integrity DES. Worlwide DES revenue in the quarter was $279 million, including $101 million in the United States and $24 million in Japan. In the U.S., our DES share remains stable sequentially at approximately 30% despite the competitors\u2019 ongoing product launch. Reported revenues in our structural heart business grew 6%. ","However, after adjusting for the difficult TAVR comparisons in Germany that I mentioned earlier, our structural heart business grew in the upper teens, driven by exceptional performance from our transcatheter valves. Making the same adjustment, we estimate that the global TAVR market is growing around 30% including over 30% growth in the U.S. Our global transcatheter valve revenue in the quarter was $131 million. The U.S. launch of CoreValve is proceeding extremely well with our U.S. share exceeding 40% in the second quarter of the launch. We received FDA approval for high risk patients in June adding to the extreme risk indemnification we received in late Q3. Our team is aggressively activating new centers with a presence now in a 160 U.S. centers well ahead of our original plans. In international, we have completed enrollment in our CoreValve Evolut R CE mark trial and are expecting approval of this differentiated next generation recapturable system with its 14-French equivalent delivery system later this fiscal year. ","In addition, we expect to start enrolling U.S. IDE study for Evolut R later this summer, a 250 patient single-arm study with 30-day follow-up. In our Aortic and Peripheral business, formerly known as endovascular, revenue of $232 million grew 5% or 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus product line and the voluntary product recall of the below the knee DCB. Aortic revenues grew 7% as our market leading Endurant II and Valiant Captivia stent grafts have each gained 2 points of share in the AAA and thoracic markets respectively.","Reported revenues for our Peripheral business declined in the mid-single digits in Q1. However, after adjusting for the discontinued product lines just mentioned, our peripheral business grew in the high-single digits with strong double-digit growth in SFA DCB products. ","During the quarter, we submitted our final data to the FDA for the IN.PACT Admiral SFA drug-coated balloon and we were recently informed by the FDA that this PMA updation will be granted expedited review status. We now expect U.S. approval for IN.PACT Admiral by the end of this fiscal year.","Now turning to our Restorative Therapies group, revenue of $1.603 billion grew 3%. Results were driven by growth in neuromodulation and surgical technologies offset by declines in spine. Spine revenue of $743 million declined 3% with declines in Core Spine and BMP offsetting growth in Interventional Spine. ","Core Spine declined 2% with U.S. declining offsetting international growth. Both the global and U.S. CoreSpine markets appear relatively flat. Our U.S. CoreSpine business is expecting to launch a number of new products in FY \u201915 but only limited set quantities of a few of these products were available in Q1. We believe these new products will help drive a return to growth in our Spine business in FY \u201915. In addition to developing leading spine technology, our business continues to focus on procedural innovation and our surgical synergy program which integrates enabling technologies, surgical tools, spinal implants and our expertise. ","Interventional spine which primarily consists of our balloon kyphoplasty product lines grew 4%. The U.S. interventional spinal growth was boosted by stabilizing trends in the use of BKP as well as our increasing participation in more segments in the market. In the international markets, double digit growth was led by strong performances in both Germany and Japan. While there is still lot of work to do in this business, we are encouraged by these results.","Turning to surgical technologies, revenue of $381 million grew 5% with steady growth across all three businesses. ENT grew to mid-single digits driven by growth in monitoring and powered systems. ENT recently launched the vent EM Sinus Dilation System which is generating strong customer acceptance and is expected to contribute to growth going forward. Neurosurgery grew 3% with solid growth in Midas Rex power equipment partially offset by fewer upgrades in large capital equipment. In advanced energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast and cardiac device replacement markets, drove solid double-digit growth.","In neuromodulation, revenue of $479 million increased 11%, driven by solid growth in pain stim, DBS and gastro\/uro. In pain stim, our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system continues to show strength in the market, including positive surgical feedback on lead durability and adaptive stim automatic stimulation adjustment. And DBS, our neurologist referral development program in the U.S. and the strength of the early stim data in the international markets, which shows DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson's disease, continues to drive double digit new implant growth. Our gastro\/uro business had solid growth in Q1 driven by a rebound in the implants in the United States.","In our diabetes group, revenue of $416 million grew 12%, driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system, which includes the Enlite CGM sensor, a smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate sensor. In Q1, we started the limited launch in Europe of MiniMed Duo with combined CGM sensor and insulating fusion set. Early feedback has been very positive due to the enhanced comfort in single insertion site. At the ADA Scientific Sessions in June, we announced a new strategic alliance with Sanofi focused on developing novel type 2 drug device combinations in care management devices. In July, the results of our OPTIMIZE trial were published in Lancet which show that Medtronic insulin pumps deliver better glucose control for people with insulin dependent type 2 diabetes than multiple daily injections.","Looking ahead, we plan to launch our next generation MiniMed 640G system with predictive low glucose management in international markets in Q2. Our MiniMed 620G Japanese language system is also expected to launch in Q2 which will be the first integrated system in Japan. In addition, we are making good progress in our sensor pipeline as we continue our advancement towards a close loop system.","Turning to rest of the income statement, it is worth noting that all of my forward-looking comments on outlook and guidance do not contemplate the expected closings of the Covidien transaction. The Q1 gross margin was 74.1% after adjusting for a 30 basis point negative impact from foreign currency the Q1 gross margin on a non-GAAP operational basis was 74.4%. The gross margin continues to include significant spending on additional resources mostly diverted from R&D to address quality issues in neuromodulation in diabetes, which negatively affected the Q1 gross margin by approximately 40 basis points. The Q1 gross margin was also negatively affected by product mix shifts in cardiac rhythm in heart failure as well as the R zone pricing adjustments in Japan, two items that will likely affected gross margin for the remainder of the fiscal year.","Looking ahead, we continue to expect the gross margin for fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of 74.5% to 75% on an operational basis with Q2 expected to be at the lower end of this range. First quarter R&D spending of $365 million was 8.5% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies as well as generating clinical and economic evidence to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in FY15 to remain around 8.5%.","First quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.506 billion represented 35.2% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 basis point positive impact from foreign exchange, Q1 SG&A was 35.3% driven by investments to drive CoreValve sales as well as higher incentive payments due to the outperformance in new product launches. We continue to expect FY15 SG&A to be in the range of 32.7% to 33.9% implying leverage of 50 basis points to 70 basis points on an operational basis. For Q2, we expect SG&A to be around 34.5% on an operational basis.","Amortization expense for the quarter was $87 million. In FY15, we continue to expect amortization expense to remain in the range of $85 million to $90 million per quarter.","Net other expenses at quarter were $51 million including net losses from our hedging program of $9 million. This result was favorable to our prior expectations due to net certain litigation gains, milestone income from diabetes meter partnership and the accounting treatment on TAVR royalties. We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility on our earnings from foreign exchange. However, there is a growing portion of our profits that is unhedged especially emerging market currencies which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. ","Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY15 net other expense to be in the range of $335 million to $375 million which includes an expected $125 million impact from the U.S. medical device tax, an incremental $13 million over FY14 as well as increased royalty expense from the Edwards agreement.","For Q2, FY15 we expect net other expense to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million based on current exchange rates. Net interest expense for the quarter was $5 million. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $14 billion from cash and investments and $12.8 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q2, FY15 net interest expense to be in the range of $5 million to $15 million. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q1 was 19.1%. For FY15, we continue to expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20% and we expect to be at the upper end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated. In Q1, we generated $1 billion from free cash flow net of certain litigation payments. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow excluding one-time items to shareholders.","In Q1, we paid $304 million in dividends and repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock. In June, Medtronic Board of Directors increased the dividend by 9%, the 37th consecutive year of increased dividend payments. As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 42 million shares. First quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.5 billion shares. It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemptions which was a $154 million in Q1 will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY15, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 998 million shares including approximately 994 million shares in Q2. ","Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2015 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We continue to believe that constant currency revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% is balanced and realistic for fiscal year 2015. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact of exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year then our FY15 revenue will be negatively affected by approximately $40 million to flat, including the negative $20 million to nearly zero impact in Q2. ","Turning to guidance on the bottom-line, we continue to expect FY15 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $4 to $4.10. Based on current exchange rates, this implies earnings per share growth in the range of 6% to 9% on a constant currency basis after taking into account the currently expected $0.05 to $0.07 negative foreign currency impact of earnings. As in the past my comments and guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, our outlook and guidance do not contemplate the impact of the expected Covidien transaction.","I will now turn it back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak ","Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A let me briefly conclude by stating that Q1 was another successful balanced quarter. We continue to strive to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations. As we presented at our Investor Conference in June, we expect our continued efforts to deliver consistent and reliable performance combined with disciplined capital allocation, will enable is to create long-term dependable value in healthcare. And looking ahead, we believe this will be further strengthened and diversified by our Covidien acquisition.","With that we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I will ask Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac & Vascular Group, Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We are really able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and if needed one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe, I can get a couple in just on the product front. First is the 40% plus share comment in transcatheter valves, I'm sure caught people's attention? Can you just talk about how that progressed over the quarter. I ask because obviously you were dealing with the potential injunction overhang in the first part of the quarter and you resolved that with the settlement with Edwards in late May. Can you just talk about that commentary? Was that 40% plus comment true for the whole quarter or was that particularly true in the back half of the quarter? And then the second product was hoping to get an update on was the IN. PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon. I believe you submitted the data in the final module at the end of May. Do you have any update from the FDA on whether you will need to go to an advisory panel? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","","Mike can you take both of these?","Mike Coyle","","So, the transcatheter valve side, of course that comment about 40% market share is a U.S. statement, that\u2019s we basically have been proceeding with the launch as we\u2019ve described it, actually a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of the total number of accounts that have been opened and the training of those accounts, and we actually are getting a little higher share in the accounts we\u2019ve activated than we were expecting when we were talking at the analyst meeting. So we think our overall market share position\u2019s in the low 40s depending on how you want to treat the royalty income, which our competitor treats as revenue we tend to exclude it for purposes of that calculation on overall market share. On the IN.PACT Admiral that we have heard from FDA in terms of the fileability of our PMA. They have accepted it for filing with no major deficiencies. They have told us they are going to treat this as an expedited review. They have not yet given us the definitive answer on whether a panel is going to be required or not. ","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan","","Perfect. Let me ask one follow-up. Can you just comment on the regulatory path for the Covidien transaction, how things are progressing with China, the US, and the other geographies of note. Thanks. ","Omar Ishrak ","","Things are progressing, Mike, as we have thought. I think the schedule for the end of the calendar year in early -- or early calendar \u201915 is what we expected when we started the process, and it still holds. The China approval is a little slower, it takes a little longer and often times after the process starts after we\u2019ve made some progress in the U.S. and Europe. Things are going along just as we had expected. There are no major surprises, and I think we still expect this to close as I said towards the end of the year or early next year.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds from Citi.","Matthew Dodds - Citi","","Good morning. If we look at the expense side on gross margin SG&A, you came in a little lower than we thought on gross margin and higher on SG&A. The full year guidance is really unchanged. You've got a big improvement, it looks like in the back half of the year. I guess for you, Gary, for the gross margin, are a lot of these issues going to linger or are some temporary other than FX? And then on SG&A, how much of the CoreValve launch and this incentive pay was front-end loaded, meaning that it won't -- it was really focused on the first quarter and it will drop?","Omar Ishrak ","","Gary.","Gary Ellis ","","I can take both of those Matt. I mean as far as the gross margin goes, we do expect the gross margin will improve as we go through the year. As we indicated, it was a little lower here in the first quarter due to some things that we have known about, which are the quality costs in Neuro and diabetes. We also ended up having just with the mix, the product mix having a little bit lower ICD revenue in this quarter before the new product has been launched, and with LINQ, which is a little bit lower margin product that had a mix issue into Q1, but as we go forward and ICDs pick up again, we should be back up in the 74.5% to 75% range as we indicated. We also expect the issues to be addressed on the quality side within neuro and diabetes as we go through the year that will also start to come down. ","And as you indicated, FX, we obviously assume will start to become a minimized issue as we go through the rest of the year. So 74.5% to 75%, Q2 improving but it\u2019d still be kind of at the lower end of that range, and continuing to improve as we go through the year. SG&A was a little more here in Q1, we kind of had expected that, we knew we are launching a lot of these new products with LINQ, CoreValve, and we just knew we\u2019re going to have some higher expectations around expenses on those items. But it was in line with basically our expectations and as we go through the rest of the year, both investments obviously will start to leverage as we go through, as the revenues continues to build in both of those product lines, and so we\u2019re expecting that the guidance we gave for SG&A and total that still remains on track and we are not concerned about at this point.","Matthew Dodds - Citi","Just a quick follow up to Mike.","Omar Ishrak ","Yes, go ahead.","Matthew Dodds - Citi","So Mike, now that the litigation's over, can you say on CoreValve are you still capacity constrained or is that not an issue, because it was a good quarter out of the chute in the US. ","Mike Boyle","","Well, we have been staying ahead of the demand, it\u2019s been challenging for our operations in the group to stay ahead of the demand, but they have been doing that and we have not done any bulking of product or advanced purchase of product. So we are essentially selling as we implant, and we expected that will continue here during the next quarter. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. ","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","","Good morning. Maybe just one for Omar, maybe a quick follow-up. Omar, I appreciate your comments on the deal and the commitment relative to Covidien. I wonder if you can comment at all on, this transaction under various different transaction structures whether there may be remedies proposed by treasury or congress or pursuing this deal without an inversion structure. You talked a little about that on the day of the deal announcement. I wonder if you could update us on your views about the commitment to this transaction under different scenarios.","Omar Ishrak","Yes. Well, as I\u2019ve mentioned repeatedly and consistently, the strategic benefits of these transaction are very clear which I laid out today and earlier. We are excited about that. We feel, as we go through our integration planning process, we feel even more confident and excited about the strategic benefits of this combined company. So that\u2019s the driver for the whole thing. We can only plan a deal structure based on facts and what the current regulations and law are. And so that\u2019s why we structured it the way we structured it. Those things change before the close then we\u2019ll have to take a look at what those changes reflect and see what we can do to structure a new contract and so forth. But in all cases the strategic benefits do not go away and are clearly not affected by any legislative or regulatory changes. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it. it\u2019s pointless to speculate in what those new changes could be to give priority of things if any. So, we prefer to stay away from that and stay focused on getting the regulatory actions taken care of as quickly as possible and then get this transaction closed, and structuring the strategic benefits.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","Great, very helpful. And then one other important element of the strategy obviously is emerging markets and I know you talked about it in your prepared remarks, but maybe just help us understand two things. It sounds like there are underlying distribution changes in both India and China. Maybe help us understand why you're undertaking those distribution challenges. Is it really for greater long term revenue growth? Was it to respond to recent revenue depression? That would be very helpful. Do you think this quarter or sometime in the next two quarters we could see a trough in the growth rate in either India or China? Thank you. ","Omar Ishrak","Yes, thanks David. First of all distribution changes as you correctly point out, we\u2019re making are long term in nature. Look, we view emerging markets like I\u2019ve said before, as a key growth driver, not just for the next few years but for decades. Literally decades, because that\u2019s the nature of the opportunity, we\u2019re only addressing the premium segment when we get to value segment, the underserved; this is going to go on for a very long term. And as a result if you really talk of the long term the revenues from these regions will be big and certainly it probably will get from developed markets and we cannot have in that kind of a scenario go through indirect channels of -- we do not have direct control as with respect not only to business conduct standards but also and more importantly with respect to direct connection with our customers because we have to develop these markets.","So, these are changes that we have to undertake. In addition, some of the management changes reflect upgrading some of the people because the nature of the business is more sophisticated than it once was. So these really are platform changes that we\u2019re making they\u2019re necessitated by our long term aspirations. And we feel we can cover it within our present business profile. And so we\u2019re going ahead and making these changes which we feel will have a positive impact not only in our relationships and long term growth but also on our margin in these regions which already is good but can improve further. So that\u2019s essentially the outlook in the strategic thought process behind emerging markets.","In term of our trough, we are projecting both India and China to be double digit growth. The China, certainly in the mid-teens and India maybe even close to that by the end of the year, in other words for the full year. And so that will require an acceleration in the second half I think it will be different between the India and China. I mean there is still some variables in this, so I can\u2019t be certain but that certainly our projection as of today that going into the second half of the year we\u2019ll start to see a noticeable acceleration of growth in both of those regions.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","Omar was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit about some of the revised numbers that Covidien put out within your proxy, just in terms of the outlook. What gives you I guess the confidence in the longer term growth profile there and what if anything have you learned or makes you more confident in the revenue trajectory or perhaps even the cost synergies with some of the early integration or early I guess work under your belt, the transaction? ","Omar Ishrak","Well, I\u2019ve been visiting many of the sites and understanding the products. And number of early observations that I have. First of all, Covidien has a track record and it builds a track record of revenue growth in the mid-single digits. And they have a diversified enough revenue pool, both geographically as well as from a product and customer basis. That appears to me that it\u2019s quite sustainable and fairly tolerant of one-off market dynamics in there whether it\u2019d be product or geography. So that is reassuring, I mean we knew that going in but deeper dive confirmed that. Equally importantly, as we go through the different sites, the future growth platforms if we can build by accelerating some of the technical, technology integration or channel integrations, there appear to be a lot of possibility. I think our biggest challenge will be to focus and make sure you prioritize the ones which will have the right returns and not go after ones that are potentially big but have perhaps returns which are more risky or even longer term. So, I think the prioritization exercise will be our biggest challenge. We have already stated that the two areas which will be the highest priority are in peripheral, vascular and in neuroscience and those are like many integration teams progressing and going ahead in those areas.","The others will be longer term and surgical technologies and their surgical solutions is clearly opportunity both in terms of product integration for common co-points as well as technical and technology integration in future products. In addition, some of the capital equipment products and their monitoring products have longer term synergy in fact both our hospital solutions teams as well as our home monitoring business in Cardiocom. I think that\u2019s about all I can say Kristen at this point.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then just on the cost synergy side, do you still feel confident that that at least 850 number is the right number?","Omar Ishrak","Yes, I doesn\u2019t think there was any sort of doubt around that. I think all the work that we are doing is confirming that that\u2019s an achievable number.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","","Great. Good morning. So I wanted to ask two quick questions. First, on the CRM market outlook, excluding LINQ which obviously is going very well, it looks like the CRM market is just a little bit worse than we thought this quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little about the market dynamics in CRM. Is pricing a little bit worse than you thought? What at this point is your outlook for CRM market growth as you look forward? ","Omar Ishrak ","I think the overall low power market actually looks quite encouraging, I think we have seen stabilization of the market demand and although we are seeing obviously some renewed pricing pressure, I mean we are now looking at sort of 3% to 5% declines in ASPs in the U.S. and both pacing at ICDs currently and that\u2019s because we basically have anniversaried the major launches that we had. However, obviously we are about to enter a new launch cycle with high power side with CRT-D and we think that\u2019s going to help us in terms of improving the overall pricing dynamics. ","In terms of the overall unit market growth, we are seeing essentially flattish unit growth in the ICD market with low single-digit increases in initial implants are being offset by declines in the replacement cycle, mostly because of where we are in our replacement cycle. So, we believe the market going forward is flattish and that\u2019s what we are planning for otherwise encouraging from my perspective to see overall U.S. implantables growth for us at 4%. I mean we haven\u2019t seen that in quite some time and so obviously it\u2019s a good time to have a product like LINQ being added into the overall mix for implantables. ","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America","","All right, that's helpful. And then Omar just wanted to ask one question for you as a follow-up on the emerging market commentary that you made thus far. Specifically on China I was wondering if you could just provide just a little more detail on the specific changes that you're making in China currently so we can get a better understanding of the outlook of China long-term and understand why those changes are being made.","Omar Ishrak ","I think this is harmonizing our distribution channels and also making sure that we have got processes in place, so the inventory levels are right. And thirdly, to make sure that specific programs have allowed us to go direct to certain major customers to start with. And maybe one of the point, we are also starting a program to go after tier 2 cities in China where there is a lot of opportunity and there we are thinking of certainly some combined products into a single channel around cardiology primarily. So, those are the changes that we are making. The biggest impact ones are really sort of fine tuning our distribution channels themselves, the specific distributors and harmonizing them, streamlining them, more focused fewer of them because that\u2019s essential to be able to maintain control both from a business conduct perspective as well as end-customer reach perspective.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse.","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse ","","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Omar, regarding the transaction, some people on the buy side have a little bit of consternation about the prospects for the minimally invasive surgery franchise of Covidien. On the other hand, you're going to have a broader playground to work in, more applications that you could tailor this. But specifically people are somewhat concerned about resurgence, robotics, et cetera. How do you view the long-term prospects of that series of applications?","Omar Ishrak","I\u2019ve had a chance to visit two of their plans to work in these areas both in terms of the minimally invasive area as well as the advanced energy businesses and you really have to look at the two together because some of the tools integrated with the minimally invasive some products to create actually a more integrated offering than many of the competitors have. So I left those visits with a clear sense that there is a lot of focus on innovation, on next generation products and from a position of strength, not from a position of catching up which actually in these areas make quite a difference because some of these product lines require a lot of clinical expertise and clinical know how and clinical intervention if you like in the development. And I felt that the teams that I visited had a very strong experience in those areas. Good product positions today and very exciting technology plans for the future. So there is competition always and J&J is a good competitor, but I\u2019ve got every confidence of the teams that are in place in Covidien and the people that I\u2019ve met are absolutely capable of not only competing against anyone both from an edge and attitude perspective but also from a technical and clinical know how perspective. ","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse ","","Thanks. And I guess my follow-up; either you or Gary could speak to. Clearly administration wants some changes in the inversion attractiveness. And one of the things that's difficult to model or at least more challenging for us to model is if the law does change, how will you kind of assess the value of access to ex-US cash? I mean, just schematically, how should we be thinking about that value if worse in fact does come to worse. ","Omar Ishrak","Look, this is difficult for us to model too. We don\u2019t know what is going to be and it\u2019s pure speculation, at this stage we just did the model based on the current law and we\u2019re really not wasting our time trying to figure out five different iterations that may or may not happen. So at this stage we\u2019re just sticking to what we know. ","Gary Ellis ","","Yes, Bruce just to add, I mean obviously we\u2019ve been clear that all the advantages outside the strategic benefit of Covidien is that we do get access to the our O-U.S. cash and that\u2019s the question we are happy addressing, if there are changes to any rules and regulation we\u2019re going to happy determining how do we get access to that, because that\u2019s the benefit of it. But as Omar said it\u2019s just -- right now it\u2019s just the pure speculation on our part and we are not even doing any modeling because we have no idea of whether there will be any changes at all as move ahead. ","Omar Ishrak","We\u2019re just close on the transaction.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor from Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays","","I wanted to ask one on emerging markets. You talked a little bit about some of the changes in China and India. There has been a couple reports about China looking to really source some more products locally. I wondered if you could talk to how that could impact your strategy longer term and whether it just means you need to change some of your structure, some of your partnerships and how you may be able to continue to win there if the market goes more towards local products. ","Omar Ishrak","","There hasn\u2019t been any broad move of that nature in China that\u2019s consistent across the whole country for all products. So I am not sure that will be driven by broad-based regulation. However, China is a big enough market on its own with unique customer requirements that local manufacturing of various sorts will be something that\u2019s going to happen in China and then so we are committed to that as you know. We already have strong local manufacturing through in orthopedics and spine where we\u2019ve established over many years and accelerated by our recent acquisitions. We have also just last quarter finalized an agreement with LifeTech which will allow us to manufacture pacemakers locally and then finally we as I mentioned on the call, building a very promising partnership with one of the sub-provinces for the manufacturing of dialysis -- hemodialysis equipment and that platform also grow to include other products. Covidien by the way also has strong manufacturing and R&D capabilities in China. So put together, we will have enough options to be able to go local in China depending on what the regulations maybe but we hope that we don\u2019t have to wait for regulations, but on the leading edge of this and doing it because of true customer demand that we sense so that we can fulfill local needs in the most appropriate fashion. So I think we\u2019re very well positioned to take advantage of any change or otherwise in China for manufacturing.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays","Thanks and I know you're focused on closing the transaction. You can't speculate on what's going to happen. I think it's been a little bit surprising to see some of the rhetoric; some of the things that are being said by politicians are erroneous. What has surprised you most about some of the potential changes that are being talked about? And do you feel like your message about investing in the US and tax is resonating with Capitol Hill?","Omar Ishrak","Look, I think it\u2019s great to see that our message around reinvesting in the U.S. has been positively received by everybody and I think that\u2019s fair. And I think in the mix of this is beyond Medtronic is just an overall number of transactions that are potentially is causing some consternation I guess again we there is not much we can do about those things we\u2019re going to put our message out as accurately as possible in general in the fashion as we know how. And then focus on the strategic benefits and make sure that we know how to dial those in. I think that\u2019s all we can do at this stage. I am not prepared to comment in any political sentiments that may be there.","Jeff Warren","","Thanks Matt. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve gone past top of the hour but we\u2019ll take two last questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company","Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Two quick ones for Mike Coyle, a follow-up on Bob's question on the CRM business. If you think about the US business being one of the anchors to corporate-wide growth, you do have a new quad pole system that's been approved. Can you help us, Mike, take us through some of the puts and takes of the pressures that you've been experienced. You did mention in one of your previous comments about the replacement cycle for Medtronic specifically. I think Chris O'Connell, one of the other anchors to top line growth has been the spine business, the projection is to get back to growth in FY15. Can you talk about the path to get back to at least market growth rates for the US ICD business? ","Omar Ishrak","Before Mike and Chris jump in, I do want to point out that although those are both important markets, the level of diversification that we now have across our entire business mix is much more resilient due to changes in just those two market segments. And we continue to go ahead in that dimension not because those two markets aren\u2019t important but because there are several others as well and to the degree that we can diversify overall business and continue to do so it is a very important initiative for us. So, with that I\u2019ll let Mike go ahead and talk about the ICD the market.","Mike Coyle","First, relative to ICD, is I think if you the challenges in the quarter are U.S. challenges. So again if you look internationally, back at market share capture and overall market growth and so we expect the CRTD product entry is going to be a big aid to that issue. But as Omar pointed out, the fact that we actually are able to see growth in the overall implantable segment because of the addition of the new product category essentially and link is really going to help drive growth there and you\u2019re obviously now looking at a lower power segment that is in this reported quarter is showing market growth in sort of both the 3% to 4% range which we haven\u2019t seen in that segment for quite some time. So, we have a very diversified product portfolio across CEG with number of new growth drivers to offset areas of flat performance and obviously that showing up in the numbers this quarter.","Omar Ishrak","Chris you want to comment on spine\u2026","Chris O'Connell","Sure. Josh on spine as Omar stated the U.S. core was a little soft in the quarter and we were expecting some of that really due to the timing of some of the new products launches as you know we just got FDA approval on PRESTIGE LP which is a really exciting development. We have some revenue for that modeled in Q1 that we\u2019re now into Q2 on. We also mentioned the BMP which was down in the quarter but we\u2019ve just anniversaried the Yale results. And as Omar pointed out, we\u2019ve had four sequential quarters of underlying stability. So those factors and some other real positives international spine particularly the developed markets is doing well and growing better than it has in recent quarters and we had a positive Kyphon quarter and are encouraged by that. So when you put all that together particularly the new product cadence in the U.S. we think we have a good pathway towards growing the U.S. spine business this fiscal year.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company","And just want a quick follow up on the IN.PACT franchise.","Jeff Warren","One last one?","Omar Ishrak","Go ahead.","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company","Just a quick one on the IN. PACT franchise, two data sets on drug coated balloons have, at least top line data for IN. PACT and a full data set for Lutonix, can you talk about the international marketplace there for peripheral balloons? It sounds like you grew double digits. And then also when we may see a publication from the IN. PACT study. Thanks a lot.","Omar Ishrak","Yes, just keep in mind, right now, the overall drug coated balloon market is like a $50 million to $60 million global market. So we have that very nice growth with the SFA indication outside the U.S. north of 20%. But we hadn\u2019t yet published to-date and that we are expecting to happen here in the fall which we think will be a nice catalyst for international market growth. And obviously as we\u2019ve seen in a lot of market segments the U.S. PMA approval tends to be a catalyst for global growth as the data really gets validated and then published and assessed. And obviously that\u2019s the kind of data that we have with the IN. PACT Admiral SFA. So we are anxious to see the US approval. We think that will be a catalyst not only for growth in the U.S. but also internationally.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo ","","One big picture question. In the second calendar, Q2 calendar year, all of the public hospital companies saw an improvement in procedure volume in the US but that didn't show up in most med tech companies' Q2 results except yours, and yours seemed to have been driven largely by new products. So can you talk about what you're seeing from a procedure standpoint in the US through July? And then just for my follow-up, I'll throw it out now. I'm sure the TAVR market -- worldwide market growth numbers caught people's attention. I think you said the US and worldwide was growing over 30%. So can you talk about what you're seeing and what's causing that acceleration since you launched CoreValve? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Let me take the first one, I think you are right in fact I know you are right. Our growth in the U.S. was driven by innovation, by new products and their launches and their uptake as opposed to general procedure volume growth which was sort of low single-digit if not flat overall. So, I think as we expected the impact of more patients coming into the system is not something that affects the med-tech companies because we are generally focused on acute care and the level of patients that eventually flow through to acute care from the increased coverage that\u2019s in place now, is relatively small. And so that\u2019s why we are not really seeing any dramatic change in procedure volumes. However, we are very encouraged and excited by seeing the impact of new products which goes to show that innovation in this market, no matter how flat it maybe and whatever people may share about it, if you have true innovation you can get growth in the U.S. so that\u2019s exciting for us. Do you want to take this?","Mike Coyle","And then on market growth, obviously there have been a number of important catalysts that\u2019s taken place over the last six months with the data obviously on the extreme risk and high risk patient populations, I mean the mortality benefit in the high risk patient population is itself a catalyst. The approval by FDA of those expanded indications. The entry of one of our competitors into Japan and the fact that there are just more companies out talking about TAVR in Europe because of the essential trialing of their new products. All of those things are basically validating the broader role that TAVR can play in the treatment of aortic stenosis and that\u2019s what is driving the overall market growth.","Omar Ishrak ","","Okay, so thanks everyone for all your questions and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q2 call which we anticipate holding on November the 18th. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I would like to thank you all again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Thank you and have a great day.","Operator","","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you.","I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Mr. Ryan Weispfenning, Please go ahead.","Ryan Weispfenning","Great. Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s fourth quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017, which ended on April 28, 2017. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments: Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue-by-division summary. We also issued an earnings presentation that provides additional details on our performance and outlook. You should note that many of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports and other filings that we make with the SEC, and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on our website, investorrelations.medtronic.com. Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency basis. References to annual results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to fiscal year 2016, and rates and ranges are given on a constant currency and constant week basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and the extra week that was in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.","Finally, other than as noted, our EPS growth and guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion, representing growth of 5%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.33, growing at 6%.","Before providing more detail on our quarterly performance, I would like to recap fiscal 2017, a solid year for Medtronic. We delivered record revenue of $29.7 billion, growing approximately 5%, in the mid-single digits for the fifth consecutive year. We made progress in each of our growth strategies. In Therapy Innovation, we executed a steady cadence of meaningful product launches, as well as introducing some groundbreaking new technologies. In Globalization, we expanded access to our therapies in emerging markets resulting in double-digit growth. And in Economic Value, we continued to extend our industry leadership in developing value-based healthcare solutions. The integration of Covidien progressed as planned. We have now realized over $600 million in synergy savings and remain on track to deliver our goal of $850 million of total cost savings by the end of the next fiscal year. This operational productivity, coupled with our revenue growth, were key contributors to delivering double digit EPS growth and generating over $5.5 billion of free cash flow.","We strategically deployed our capital in line with our stated priorities, balancing return of cash to our shareholders together with disciplined reinvestment in our businesses. We met our commitment of returning greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and net share repurchases. In addition, we invested approximately $1.5 billion in several strategic investments and five tuck-in acquisitions, and we expect these acquisitions to further enhance our revenue growth and improve returns over time.","Finally, late in the fiscal year, we announced the sale of a portion of our PMR division to Cardinal Health for $6.1 billion as part of our disciplined portfolio management strategy. But most importantly, in fiscal year 2017, together with our physician partners, we served 70 million patients, more patients in more places around the world than any year in our history. It is incredible that two patients around the world are benefitting from Medtronic therapies and services every second. I am very proud of our more than 88,000 dedicated employees, for all that they accomplished in fiscal year 2017, and all that we can accomplish going forward, as we continue to fulfill the Medtronic Mission.","Moving now to fourth quarter performance. We had a strong finish to our fiscal year 2017, delivering over 5% revenue growth. CVG, MITG, RTG, and Diabetes all grew in the mid-single digits. Geographically, we also demonstrated solid, balanced performance, with mid-single digit growth in the U.S. and non-U.S. developed markets, and double-digit growth in emerging markets. Complementing our solid revenue growth, our operating margin and cash flow continued to improve as expected.","Our performance continues to be fueled by our three growth strategies: Therapy innovation; globalization; and economic value. We are creating distinct competitive advantages and capitalizing on the long-term trends in healthcare, namely, the desire to improve clinical outcomes; the growing demand for expanded access to care; and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems. These trends, along with an aging population in most countries, produce secular growth tailwinds that we believe represent sustainable, long-term opportunities for Medtronic.","Now, let\u2019s discuss our fourth quarter performance against each of our growth strategies. In Therapy Innovation, we continued to see strong adoption of our innovative products across all our groups.","In our Cardiac & Vascular Group, which grew 5%, we are leveraging the breadth of our products and services, as well as our strong positions in important, rapidly expanding markets to drive sustainable growth. Combined, our TAVR, insertable diagnostics, AF ablation, LVADs, and drug-coated balloons are now annualizing at nearly $3 billion and growing at over 20%. In our cardiac rhythm implantables businesses, we recently received CMS approval for reimbursement coverage in the US for Micra, the world\u2019s smallest pacemaker. Also, as announced last week, we now have U.S. approval for the first MRI safe quadripolar CRT pacing system.","In TAVR, we delivered mid-30s growth and increased our market share sequentially in both the U.S. and Europe on the continued launch of our Evolut R 34 mm valve. In Coronary, we just received FDA approval of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent at the start of this fiscal year. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong growth in TAVR, driven by the Evolut PRO valve and intermediate risk indication expansion, and in Coronary, we expect the recent approval of the Resolute Onyx will turn the mid-20s U.S. DES sales declines that we experienced in fiscal 2017 into meaningful growth this fiscal year.","In our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which grew 6%, we had high single digit growth in Surgical Solutions driven by new products in Advanced Energy and Advanced Stapling. In Advanced Energy, we continue to rollout three new LigaSure instruments with a nanocoating that helps reduce instrument cleaning, which improves surgical procedure efficiency. And, we continue to see strength in the Valleylab FT10 energy platform. In Advanced Stapling, results were driven by the sustained adoption of our endo stapling specialty reloads. We also launched Signia, our new, single-handed powered surgical stapler that provides surgeons with real-time feedback during surgery. These new products continue to facilitate the move of open surgical procedures to minimally invasive, resulting in better patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs.","In Patient Monitoring & Recovery, our above market growth was driven by strength in our PB980 ventilator, our Capnostream 20 bedside capnography monitor, capnography disposables, as well as our Nellcor pulse oximetry products.","Our Restorative Therapies Group grew 5% this quarter, with strong contributions from our Spine, Brain, and Specialty Therapies divisions. Our Spine division grew 3% and again gained market share. Core Spine grew in the low-single digits, continuing to benefit from our Speed to","Scale initiative as we continued to launch a series of new products, including the Solera Voyager and Elevate expandable cage. In addition, Infuse sales were strong, growing the double digits. Our Brain Therapies division grew 9%, driven by double-digit growth in Neurovascular and Neurosurgery. In Neurosurgery, our StealthStation S8 surgical navigation system received strong surgeon enthusiasm at the American Academy of Neurological Surgeons annual conference last month. While we launched it late in the fourth quarter, we expect it to result in accelerating sales growth next fiscal year.","Turning to our Diabetes Group, the growth rate at 4% decelerated sequentially as we predicted, ahead of the full launch of the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed loop system. Despite this, we gained insulin pump share in both the U.S. and international markets, driven by strong clinician and consumer demand for our 6 series pumps. In the U.S., direct pump shipments to consumers grew over 20%. In CGM, we grew in the low-20s and are seeing strong growth globally as more patients transition to our sensor-augmented pumps.","Regarding the U.S. launch of the MiniMed 670G, we have approximately 750 people taking part in our Customer Training Phase. The feedback has been extremely positive with a continued increase in patient satisfaction levels. We are preparing for a broader launch in June to the more than 20,000 pump users that are enrolled in our Priority Access Program. As stated before, we do not expect revenue growth to ramp substantially until after we have fulfilled the Priority Access orders, given the low revenue associated with the upgrade program.","Our product pipeline remains robust across all our groups, with a number of important near-term growth catalysts. We remain confident that our new therapies can drive sustainable growth next fiscal year and beyond.","Next, let\u2019s turn to Globalization. Emerging markets grew 10%, as we continue to expand access to our products and services around the world. In addition to ongoing traditional market development, we are executing on differentiated strategies, namely structuring partnerships with both governments and the private sector, as well as optimizing our distribution channels. We believe that these initiatives will not only position us for long-term leadership in emerging markets, but also will accelerate growth and lead to sustained market outperformance.","In the Middle East, we continued to face challenges in the macroeconomic environment, causing our revenue to decline in the mid single digits. However, in Saudi Arabia, our largest market in the region, we are encouraged by the relatively stable sequential revenue we have delivered for the past two quarters, albeit at a lower base, given the large year-over-year declines experienced earlier this fiscal year.","In other regions around the world, we delivered strong, double digit growth in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, and high single digit growth in Eastern Europe. In China, we grew in the low teens, with double digit growth across CVG, MITG, and RTG, largely driven by strong growth in pacemakers, advanced stapling, and neurovascular. In addition, we are seeing success from our expansion into Chinese 2 tier cities and private hospitals. In Latin America, we had high-teens growth led by strong results in RTG, Surgical Solutions, and Coronary & Structural Heart.","Brazil, Mexico, Chile, and Argentina all grew double digits. In Southeast Asia, which grew in the low-20s, we executed a number of channel optimization initiatives, including moving to direct distribution models in certain businesses in Indonesia and the Philippines.","Overall, the consistency of our Emerging Market performance benefits greatly from geographic diversification, reducing dependence on any single market. We continue to believe that the penetration of existing therapies into Emerging Markets represents the single largest opportunity in MedTech over the long-term.","Turning now to our third growth strategy, Economic Value. We continue to see success in our","Hospital Solutions business, which grew double digits, as we are now managing cath labs and operating rooms for more than 130 customers around the world. Also, we continue to execute our value-based healthcare signature programs. One of these is TYRX, our anti-infection envelope for implantable devices, which is an example of where a technology change directly results in clear and measurable value to the healthcare system, without any dependence on other variables. Since launching our value-based program for TYRX earlier this calendar year, we have outcome-based contracts in place at over 140 accounts, helping drive over 20% revenue growth in TYRX in the fourth quarter. Infection control for implantable devices is a large opportunity, as in the U.S. alone, over 6,000 patients are affected annually.","We are aggressively developing other unique, value-based healthcare solutions across each of our groups. And while we are still early in this journey, we remain focused on leading the shift to healthcare payment systems that reward value and improved patient outcomes over volume. As always, we expect to do this in a way that benefits patients, healthcare systems, as well as our shareholders.","Before turning the call over to Karen, I would like to highlight the agreement that we reached in the fourth quarter to divest a portion of our Patient Monitoring & Recovery division to Cardinal Health.","We were pleased to receive clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission last week and continue to expect this transaction to close in our second quarter of fiscal year 2018. This is a positive transaction for all involved, including our shareholders and employees, who, we believe, will thrive under this change in ownership. We are committed to disciplined portfolio management, and we reached the conclusion that these businesses, while truly meaningful to patients in need, are best suited under ownership that can provide the investment and focus that these businesses require. Upon closing, this transaction will have an immediate positive impact on our revenue growth rates and margins, with modest near-term earnings dilution. We intend to continue investing over the long-term in internal and external opportunities that are more directly aligned with our growth strategies and focus on strong financial returns.","With that, let me ask Karen to now take you through a more detailed look at the drivers of our fourth quarter financial results. Karen?","Karen Parkhill","Thank you, Omar.","Our fourth quarter revenue of $7,916 million increased 5%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency had a negative $37 million impact on fourth quarter revenues, and acquisitions contributed approximately 110 basis points to revenue growth.","GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.84. Non-GAAP was $1.33. After adjusting for the $0.2 negative impact from foreign currency, non-GAAP diluted EPS grew 6%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 30.7% on a constant currency basis, representing a year-over-year improvement of 40 basis points. With the impact of currency included, our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin also improved, increasing 10 basis points year-over-year. We continued to cover the earnings dilution from our recent acquisitions, which means we maintained earnings expectations while realizing incremental acquisition revenue. Taking into account currency and the acquisitions that we have done in the past year, our operating margin improvement on an organic basis was approximately 70 basis points in the quarter.","The operating margin improvement was driven in part by efficiencies as we continue to deliver on our Covidien synergies. This was partially offset by purposeful investments we made in sales and marketing ahead of upcoming product launches.","Net other expense was $48 million compared to income of $21 million in the prior year, due in large part to lower net gains from our foreign exchange hedging programs.","Our full year operating margin improved 140 basis points on an organic basis, which takes into account the impact of foreign currency, acquisitions we have done within the past year, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. This solid operating margin improvement was within our expected range for the year.","Below the operating profit line, net interest expense was $196 million, a sequential increase driven in part by our debt issuance in March. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $33.4 billion in debt and $13.7 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion dollars was trapped.","Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis was 17%, in line with our expectations. Fourth quarter average daily shares outstanding, on a diluted basis, were 1,381 million shares.","Turning to shareholder payout, in fiscal 2017, we paid $2.4 billion in dividends and repurchased a net $3.1 billion of our ordinary shares. This represented a total payout ratio of 86% on non-GAAP net income and 136% on GAAP net income. Keep in mind, our payout ratio is elevated as we have been continuing to not only return 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders, but also execute the $5 billion incremental share repurchase commitment we made through fiscal year 2018.","Before moving to our income statement guidance, I want to reinforce our commitment to strong free cash flow generation, which we recognize is an important driver of long-term shareholder value. In fiscal year 2017, our free cash flow was $5.6 billion, in line with our guidance, and representing very strong year-over-year growth of 35%. This growth was well above our long-term expectation to grow free cash flow in the high single digit range, roughly in line with earnings and is primarily due to the timing of litigation and tax items that affected our income statement in fiscal 2017 but won\u2019t impact cash flow until fiscal 2018. As you know, cash flow is subject to large swings in discrete items and, as we have demonstrated this year, can also be affected by timing. Going forward, we will talk about cash flow growth against a longer, multi-year view, and as such would expect our free cash flow to grow in the high-single digits, compounded annually, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2018.","Now, looking at the picture ahead. To avoid confusion, our guidance for this next fiscal year does not take into account the impact of the planned divestitures. We intend to update our guidance upon close of the transaction.","For fiscal year 2018, we expect constant currency revenue growth to be in the range of 4 to 5%, on both an organic basis and after taking into account the year-over-year benefit from the acquisitions we completed early last fiscal year. By business group, we expect CVG to grow in the range of 5 to 6%, MITG to grow in the range of 3 to 4%, RTG to grow approximately 4%, and Diabetes to grow in the 10 to 12% range, increasing from the first half to the second as we fully launch 670G beyond our Priority Access Program. Looking at the [fourth] quarter, we would expect total Medtronic revenue growth to be similar to the annual range. But, keep in mind that in the first quarter, we will be fulfilling the 670G Priority Access Program, so we would expect Diabetes growth to be similar to the past quarter and ramp throughout the year.","We expect solid operating margin improvement in fiscal year 2018, with greater strength in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect our gross margin on a constant currency basis to be flat to slightly improve throughout the fiscal year, with modest pricing pressure offset by operating improvement. Given historical and current foreign exchange rates, we expect currency to negatively affect the gross margin in the first half of the year, with a greater impact in the first quarter than the second.","SG&A, as a percent of revenue, is expected to improve next fiscal year, particularly in the back half as we continue to realize additional Covidien synergies in our enabling functions and transition to centers of excellence. However, in the first half of the fiscal year, we expect SG&A as a percent of revenue to remain relatively flat from the first quarter to the second, as we invest in sales and marketing for important new indications and product launches, including TAVR intermediate risk, Resolute Onyx and the 670G.","Given our recent debt issuance and the purposeful liquidation of some of our investments, we expect net interest expense to moderately increase over the level just reported in the fourth quarter. And, while difficult to predict given the dependency on our stock price movement, we expect a slight tax benefit from the accounting change for excess benefits on stock options we will implement in fiscal year 2018.","With respect to earnings, we expect fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to grow in the range of 9 to 10% on a constant currency basis, with higher growth in the back half of the year as we fully launch important new products and realize additional savings in SG&A as mentioned. In addition to these items, given the tax benefits we had in the first half of fiscal 2017 that are not expected to repeat, we would expect first quarter EPS to be in the upper end of the high single digit range, with the second quarter in the mid single digit range, both on a constant currency basis.","While the impact from currency is fluid and therefore not something we forecast, if recent exchange rates, which include a $1.12 euro and 111 yen, remain stable for the fiscal year, our full year revenue would be positively affected by approximately 75 to $175 million. Given historical and current rates, the impact from foreign currency would be a headwind in the first half of the fiscal year including approximately 10 to $60 million negative impact to revenue in the first quarter, and shift to a tailwind with the comparison against a stronger dollar in the second half. Full year EPS would be negatively affected by approximately $0.05 to $0.10, including a negative impact of approximately $0.03 to $0.05 in the first quarter.","As Omar mentioned, we expect the divestiture of a portion of our Patient Monitoring and Recovery division to Cardinal Health to close in our second fiscal quarter. As stated upon announcement, the transaction is expected to result in modest net dilution to our fiscal 2018 non-","GAAP earnings per share in the range of approximately $0.12 to $0.18, with the exact amount primarily dependent on the closing date of the transaction. The transaction is expected to improve our comparable, constant currency revenue growth rate and non-GAAP comparable, constant currency operating margin by approximately 50 basis points each. As previously stated, we intend to allocate $1 billion of the after-tax proceeds to an incremental share repurchase in fiscal 2018, with the balance used to reduce debt.","Now, I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen.","To conclude, Q4 was a strong finish to the fiscal year, with balanced, diversified growth across our groups and regions. Along with the mid-single digit revenue growth, our organization delivered meaningful operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth, as well as growth in free cash flow in fiscal 2017.","Looking ahead, I want to reiterate our longer term commitment to drive not only mid single digit constant currency revenue growth and double digit constant currency EPS growth, but also our focus on long-term value creation through strong free cash flow and strategic capital allocation, balancing return of cash to our shareholders with disciplined reinvestment to fuel future growth.","We will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Karen, I\u2019ve asked Mike Coyle, President of CVG; Bryan Hanson, President of MITG; Geoff Martha, President of RTG; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group, to join us. We want to try to get to as many people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question, if necessary, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact Ryan and our Investor Relations team after the call.","Operator, first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Two strategic questions to start off and I\u2019ll jump back in queue. The first is on cap deployment, the second one on margins. And maybe Omar or Karen, on capital deployment, if we think about the last access to cash you have between Puerto Rico and in the Cardinal assets, it\u2019s $8 billion, 7 of that is going to go into debt repayment. So, can you just talk about the messaging for shareholders here about repaying that debt, is simply a commitment to debt holders, what does it tell us about your interest in growth minded M&A or frankly larger would someone call more transformational M&A? And then I have a quick question on margins. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","First of all, we\u2019ve stated our capital allocation policies and we\u2019re kind following that. Second, we\u2019ve got a big transaction with this divestiture that you\u2019re -- that\u2019s coming up, and we\u2019re really focused on that. Third, our strategy for acquisitions, we\u2019ve said all along which is a disciplined strategy of looking at companies which fit our strategic goals that give us returns above our cost of capital over the long-term and that either doesn\u2019t have any or minimizes any dilution to present income. And those are the strategies we look at and the sizes, secondary and all of that through the strategic goals of the company and whether it fits or not is what we look for. But right now our focus really is on the divestiture.","Karen Parkhill","I would just add that in the near term we\u2019re focused on fulfilling our commitment to reduce our leverage post the Covidien acquisition, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. Over the longer term, we\u2019re focused on reinvestments to drive stronger growth and better margins in the longer term.","David Lewis","Okay. That\u2019s very clear. And then, Karen, just come on fiscal 2018 guidance, by our math, it applies about 80 or 90 basis points of margin expansion and that\u2019s sort of the lower hand of the place holder, you set down, or the Company set down last year sort of 70 to 140 basis points. So, is this sort nearly a refinement as we get closer to the year, some conservatism? What does it tell us about your commitment to delivering those longer term targets of 500 to 600 basis points or better? Thank you.","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for the question, David. We\u2019re very focused on driving operating margin improvement and leverage. And we cannot get to our double digit bottom line on our mid single digit top line without driving that operating leverage improvement. We\u2019re focused on driving solid plans going forward and executing against those solid plans to ensure that we deliver. As I said before, we will focus on the top line and bottom line, recognizing we need to get the leverage in between, but not focus as much as on the exact basis points of leverage in between because that can vary in any period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.","Mike Weinstein","Karen, a couple of financial items first. First one, the IRS appeal deal of the decision on Puerto Rico and that apparent delay to the resolution of that; how does that impact debt pay down plan and basically the assumption on cash flows -- for use of cash flows in FY18?","Karen Parkhill","So, the IRS did recently request to appeal the tax court decision. We do expect this to delay the ultimate outcome and the movement of cash. Until the IRS files are opening brief, which we expect in the first quarter, we won\u2019t have a better estimate on the length of the delay. We do still believe our initially filed returns were correct and we continue to defend that position. In terms of the movement of cash and the debt pay down, we do anticipate to use obviously the proceeds from the divestiture to pay down debt. And our leverage target of getting to around three times at the end of this fiscal year and continuing to be focused on maintaining an A credit rating do not include the expected proceeds of the Puerto Rico settlement.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. That\u2019s perfect. You made a comment about the impact on tax issue 2016 09 adoption; what is the EPS impact, given estimate of $0.05?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. We are -- it is included in our guidance of 9% to 10% EPS growth. And so, we are not giving an exact amount on that, mainly because it is dependent on our stock price movement, on the exercise of our options which are inherently very difficult to predict. We do expect that change to give us a slight tax benefit in the next year.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Then last item just on 670G launch. So, I want to make sure we are all thinking about just the timing of this ramp, not only in terms of what it means for revenues but in terms of share gains. Is it fair to assume that you really don\u2019t want to be offensive going what I would characterize as non-Medtronic patients more in the second half of FY18 versus the first half because right now, you are obviously dealing with the initial customer feedback to launch and in June you are going to the existing Medtronic patients, will be more second half of the year before you are really in a position to go out and take market share?","Hooman Hakami","Hey, Mike. This is Hooman. I\u2019ll answer the question. First, maybe a little bit of perspective on the fourth quarter because we were going through Priority Access there. And as was indicated in the commentary, even with Priority Access, we actually saw strong performance relative to the market and our peers. So, with the 630 and Priority Access, we gained over 4 points of durable pump market share in the fourth quarter. The other thing I would point out that I think is worthy of note is that globally our CGM sales grew in the low-20s because of the sensor attachment to all of these pumps. So, even though we are going through Priority Access fulfillment right now, in Q1 and we expect as Karen mentioned a ramp from Q1 to Q4, I think we\u2019re going to really put ourselves in a position to continue to take market share. And as we think about the full year, we feel really good that we are going to be able to end the year, not only with market share gains but also double-digit growth.","Operator","It comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","So, I just wanted to first of all congrats on a strong finish to the year. I guess for my first question, I just wanted to clarify the fiscal 2018 guidance because there wasn\u2019t actually an EPS given. So, I think I\u2019ve got this straight but you are saying off of a 460 number for fiscal 2017, underlying earnings growth of 9% to 10% less the $0.05 to $0.10 form FX, and then there is obviously the $0.12 to $0.18 we need to think about for Cardinal. So, question number one is, is that right; do I have all the moving pieces correct? And then this is nitpicking a little bit but I\u2019m just curious on fiscal 2018, why the 9% to 10% is just a little bit below the double-digit goal that you talk about long-term?","Karen Parkhill","Thanks for the question, Bob. You have the right ins and outs. And we did say that we will update the guidance post the close of the divestiture, just a little confusion. So but, the impacts from the -- the dilutive impact on EPS is you right that $0.12 to $0.18 is dependent on when we close the acquisition. We still expect close in the second quarter, but we don\u2019t know if it will be the beginning of the second quarter or the end of the second quarter. So, that\u2019s why we have the range.","In terms of the $0.09 to $0.10 EPS growth -- 9% to 10% EPS growth, we obviously are fully committed to our mid single digit top line and double digit bottom line growth over the longer term. In this fiscal year, our top end of that range is clearly double digit. Impacting the lower end of that range is the fact that we have a temporary increase in our interest expense, this fiscal year, given the slight increase in our debt as we focus on repaying it down with the proceeds. So, it\u2019s a temporary impact. And then, we also do have purposeful investment in SG&A in the first half of the year as we get ready to launch very important new product.","Bob Hopkins","And then, Omar, one bigger picture question for you. Love to get your views on something that we\u2019ve been trying to ask a lot of MedTech management teams lately, given how well the medical device space is doing. If you look at the earnings reports from hospital companies, their volumes aren\u2019t really doing much. But the medical device space, it seems like surgical procedure volumes are growing at a very nice clip. So, what are you seeing out there as you exited your fiscal year in terms of surgical procedure volumes and kind of what\u2019s your look for the rest of this year? And again, I ask the question because it just seems like MedTech is different than hospital volumes right now?","Omar Ishrak","I think your observation is correct. And as you said, our surgical volumes are hanging in there, they are stable. I won\u2019t say that they are going in upward trend or anything, but they\u2019re certainly stable. And I see that to continue. I would like to point out though that MedTech markets do swing a little more based on new product introductions, especially in the U.S., which is what we are looking at. And so, like we have had some pretty important launches in the last six months or so, and also important ones going forward as we have mentioned. So, I think you should probably think that into account that the technology introductions do give a swing to the MedTech space that probably hospitals in general wouldn\u2019t see. I think that\u2019s the best I can do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","I guess maybe on the guidance, Karen, that 4% to 5% constant currency growth for our fiscal 2018. It looks like maybe M&A is less than 50 bps, but I just want to make sure the organic for fiscal 2018 is still about 4% and that\u2019s what the guidance is implying?","Karen Parkhill","Yes. That\u2019s correct, Vijay. Our guidance for revenue would be on an organic basis and including the impact from acquisitions that will benefit us more in the first part of that year, given that we acquired these assets at the beginning of last fiscal year.","Vijay Kumar","And then may be Omar, one for you. Obviously margin expansion has been a huge focus for the Company. Gross margin performance in the quarter was really impressive. And then for me -- for us, CVG, which -- that your highest margin segments sort of came in line; MITG and RTG came in well above despite that gross margins came in well above. Maybe can you can just talk about what\u2019s going on within the margins and how confident you feel about margin expansion over the medium term? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","As we\u2019ve mentioned before, as we transition out of getting margin improvement from the Covidien synergies to the future, gross margin improvement through operations consolidation is going to be one of our biggest growth drivers in that area, our productivity drivers in that area. And as we do that -- as you put that [ph] you will see benefit across all groups because operations consolidation takes advantage of common facilities and that drives this proportion increase in some of the areas. So, I would say that that is one of our key strategic drivers; it\u2019s one that we\u2019re focused on; it\u2019s a first big transformational element of productivity that we\u2019re focused on as we come out of the Covidien synergy period, which will really be finished by the end of this coming fiscal year. So, that\u2019s what we expect to see, and we expect to see continued improvement in gross margin. And as Karen pointed in the guidance, we expect some improvement in the coming year.","Operator","It comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro","I wanted to start with a big picture question on 2018 guidance. Could you just speak a little bit to your underlying assumptions for the CapEx and utilization backdrop in the U.S.? There is clearly a lot of policy uncertainty out there. I appreciate sort of your baseline assumption there.","Omar Ishrak","Well, the CapEx, our business is overall less dependent on CapEx. But at the same, if you remember that the CapEx that we have is very linked to procedures. These are not necessary diagnostic procedures; these are actual therapy procedures and therefore is often funded by growth in those procedures. So, we\u2019re somewhat -- I think it\u2019s better to see our business more in line with volumes of procedures, rather than CapEx investments in general. So, I think that\u2019s probably a better way to look at our business rather than specifically CapEx investments.","Karen Parkhill","And I would just -- in terms of CapEx hitting our cash flow, we would anticipate approximately $1 billion over the next two to three years, in line with what we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years. Our spending on IT investments should come down over the next one to two years but that will be offset by investments in our manufacturing consolidation strategy.","Isaac Ro","Thanks for that. May be just to clarify, my question, Omar, was really, not so -- I appreciate your business sense. I wasn\u2019t talking so much about capital equipment purchasing but just the general preponderance for hospitals to spend on new technology and then at the same time utilization in terms of overall healthcare volume.","Omar Ishrak","I think, look, the new technology -- we\u2019ve seen that when meaningful new technology comes out in our space, it comes out with good clinical evidence that says that if you deploy these, they have meaningful benefit for patients. And in general, we\u2019ve seen, if reimbursement is there, which we usually make sure it is, then there is pretty good adoption when new technology comes in. And we see the market and basically share goes up with the introduction of those new products. So, I think that\u2019s really the biggest driver of any market swings into the MedTech space in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","So, two financial questions for me. So, Omar, you grew about 5% in fiscal 2017 on a constant currency week adjusted basis and you are guiding to 4% to 5% in fiscal 2018, despite the fact you have a lot of new product launches and important new indications. So, the question is kind of why didn\u2019t you feel comfortable kind of guiding to 4% to 6%? It\u2019s a little bit like Bob\u2019s earlier question on the 9% to 10%; it\u2019s a little bit nitpicky. And so, what areas might slow in fiscal 2018 relative to fiscal 2017?","Omar Ishrak","Look, we just wanted to provide a slightly tighter range than a generic mid-single digit range which we could have, but we just wanted to give a slightly tighter range. And I think that\u2019s where that came from. I think that what we\u2019ve seen this past fiscal year is we\u2019ve seen some movement in the quarter, there is some level of uncertainty in marketplaces always. So, we just wanted to make sure that we again can hit the guidance that we put out there. I think the trend that we have right now, the new products would suggest that we should be able to deliver within that range.","Larry Biegelsen","All right, fair enough. Karen, I\u2019m sorry. Were you going to say something?","Karen Parkhill","No, the only thing that I would add is that we are focused on delivering consistent reliable growth.","Larry Biegelsen","Fair enough. And then, Karen, one for you. You had FX swing from I think it was negative $100 million to negative $300 million to positive $75 million to $175 million or swing of about $325 million at the midpoint from negative to positive. But the EPS impact remained at kind of negative $0.05 to $0.15. And I know everybody realizes you hedged but do we ever at some point see the benefit from the change in currency on the top line; do we ever see that benefit on the bottom line? Thanks for taking the questions, guys.","Karen Parkhill","Thank you for the questions. We do have -- we do expect if current rates remain stable to where they are today, a positive impact to revenue for the year, as you mentioned the $75 million to $175 million and a negative EPS impact of $0.05 to $0.10. That mismatch is really driven by the fact that the FX impact on revenue is based on rates versus a year-ago, put simply. But the impact on gross margin is based on the time the inventory\u2019s been on our balance sheet. So that can mean you can have differences between the top and bottom line impact. But, I think it\u2019s important to note for this fiscal year at least in any case that that $0.05 to $0.10 negative impact on the bottom line is only a small headwind compared to previous years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matt Taylor","I wanted to ask a more detailed question maybe about the CVG guidance, because you are forecasting 5% to 6% and outlined a couple of product launches that you are going to be spending behind. So, I thought it\u2019d be worth talking about this more specifically with Onyx coming to market here and then intermediate risk and then Micra is new too. So, could you give us some color commentary on those things and what\u2019s really driving the CVG growth?","Omar Ishrak","I\u2019ll let Mike answer that question. So, go ahead, Mike.","Mike Coyle","Yes. We\u2019re heading into particularly I think attractive pace for new product introduction. Obviously the 34 mm is now available in U.S. and in Europe and impacted the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve got the approval for Evolut PRO, which is our next generation valve, transcatheter valve in the U.S. that really didn\u2019t have an impact on Q4, but will in Q1 and that will follow on with European group in the first half of next year. As you mentioned Onyx in the U.S. is now approved didn\u2019t really impact Q4, but will for the rest of fiscal 2018. Micra and CRT-D quad, the MRI -- CRT-D quad will also have meaningful impact on the quarter. And as we move through the summer, we expect expansion of intermediate risk for core valve as well as Onyx approval in Japan and in the second half we will be looking at destination therapy for the hardware technology as well as drug-coated balloon improvement in Japan. So those will big the drivers of our growth in FY18.","Matt Taylor","And maybe just a bigger picture question kind of for Omar and Karen. Just wondering, your emerging market growth is about 10% and you\u2019ve talked for long term about aspirational goals that are higher than that. Obviously you highlighted a lot of the moving parts with different geographies this quarter, but what you need to do to be able to push that rate up over time or is it just more of a function of how the micro environment is?","Omar Ishrak","Yes, I think, look, we intend to move that up. I mean that is our goal. I think the move will be gradual, rather than sudden. So, expect that from us. I think there is enough macroeconomic uncertainty that what we have had is the odd region really getting hurt by that. I want to point out that these are macroeconomic, but like the Saudi situation, was not a reduction in implant rates. So, the procedures actually are pretty stable. But as these countries sort out their own management of inventory and their own ability to deliver these products, they are going through these moves, which drive some constrains in the sale of these products. So, I am not sure that they are all necessary bad as these markets stabilize over time. We are encouraged by the fact that the implant rates actually at the customer level continue to grow. That\u2019s one thing. So, the closer we get to these customers and more direct we become, I think you will start to see these rates start to go up in a systematic fashion. If I were to point one thing, it is our ability to go direct. I think the more we do that, the higher our growth rates will become, not only from immediate transition but ongoing growth as we get closer to these customers.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn Novarro","Two questions, first for Mike Coyle. Mike, it looks like you had a real solid U.S. ICD [ph] number in the quarter, and by our math, it looks like, you took share. It looks like you are taking share first because you are still in the only play with MRI safe and then second you are still dealing with their recalls. So, how should we think about the ability to continue capture share in the U.S. through this year and how should we think about share capture as we go into calendar 2018 when St. Jude and Boston get MRI safe in the U.S.? So that\u2019s for Mike. And then, for Bryan, can you quickly give us an update on the robot. I think at stages, we\u2019re talking about launch outside the U.S. for your surgical robot in fiscal 2018. Thanks.","Mike Coyle","Glenn, I think we actually did have some meaningful share capture in the U.S. from really two sources, one was what was initial implant growth, which was approaching the single digit, which is pretty good given that the overall market was probably slightly down in terms of initial implants. But we also -- and as you point it\u2019s a combination of things, not just the MRI labeling that we have but also some very significant differentiation in each of the product categories. Our Visia AF is the only single-chamber device that can actually detect atria fibrillation and report it out, so essentially getting [indiscernible] with each single-chamber device.","And then, the differentiated algorithms that we have within our CRT systems, the Adaptive CRT and quad CRT that have been showing reduced hospitalization for the recurrent heart failure. So, those are things that we think will continue to maintain differential advantage for us even after competitors match up on the MRI side, which was not the case, it was more of an equalization [ph] when they came out with the technology. But the other thing that was occurring during the quarter and we expect to continue to occur is that we\u2019ve actually had a nice improvement share on the replacement market and that is principally driven by that as you point out a major competitive recall but even more important by this TYRX [ph] program that was mentioned in the context of the commentary.","Infections are particularly a problem in replacement procedures especially with ICD and CRT systems. And we instituted this risk-sharing performance guarantee program where an account can actually get, if you will, insurance on a patient combing back with an infection, we will make a major payment, [indiscernible] to help offset the cost of the infection, as they will lose money on given current reimbursement rates and what they have to do to treat those patients. But that\u2019s only available; they are actually using the envelope on a Medtronic device. So, that has actually resulted in a pretty big spike to percent increase in the number of devices that are going in on competitive leads. And so that is really helping us to drive growth.","Glenn Novarro","Okay, great. And then, Bryan, on the robot?","Bryan Hanson","Thanks for the question. So, we\u2019re finally in the fiscal year, we\u2019re planning on launching robotic system and I guess that we\u2019re pretty excited about it. It\u2019s at the end of the year, unfortunately; I wish it was in the beginning but it\u2019s at the end of the year. I will remind everyone that we don\u2019t expect material revenue in 2018; we do expect material revenue in 2019, as we\u2019ve been saying. But I want to make sure that we refocus everybody on our 10th year. In robotic system our goal isn\u2019t necessarily just to compete in robotics; this is a part of a much broader strategy for us. The fact is we\u2019ve got a lot of open procedures today that we truly believe should be done minimally invasively. And I am perfectly fine with them being done minimally invasively in a traditional sense or robotics. But either way, if we can do that, we can number one, fulfill the mission of the organization, because these patients will be treated in a much better way from an outcomes prospective. And all our stakeholders when we make this move from open to MIS.","Byproduct is which we are really focused on. We don\u2019t have to add an additional patient to the surgical funnel, but if we can make this shift from open to any form of minimally invasive surgeries, we can add a $10 billion marketplace. So that\u2019s the $10 billion price of that a single new patient just changing the way the patient is treated. And we do feel that there will be some period of time that we will be the only medical device company in the world that will be able to offer a full complement of products and open traditional MIS and robotics and on top of that bringing these optimization services to the operating room. So we\u2019re pretty excited obviously and looking forward to the launch.","Glenn Novarro","And the U.S. launch is still in fiscal 2019, is that correct?","Bryan Hanson","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuensch","I actually have two. The first one was to go back to the view towards operating synergies. As you end the near of the end -- near the end, I\u2019ll get there, of the Covidien synergy opportunity, where else are you going to be able to pull levers to get that leverage?","Omar Ishrak ","Well, like I mentioned little earlier and like we\u2019ve stated all long, the first area that we are already beginning to see some benefit from is in operations consolidation, in reducing our manufacturing footprint, consolidating many of the operations that we\u2019ve had around the world that we\u2019ve sort of instituted over time. So, we expect some gross margin improvement as a result of that and that\u2019s our first focus.","Beyond that through the Covidien integration, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to put in place a new IT system and SAP. And I think the benefits of that will play itself out over a longer period in the next few years as we reduce our back office footprint in different centers around the world. I think those are the two big ones. I think following that we are also looking at creating more-efficient shared services in some of our functions, which again the availability of an IT system facilitates that as well. So, those are the approaches that we are going after and we are building a pretty solid strategic roadmap to execute that.","Joanne Wuensch","That\u2019s helpful. And as my second question, we\u2019re a little bit over a year on the implementation of the CMS bundled payment program in the U.S. What observationally have you learned and how have you incorporated that into your business practices? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Yes. We\u2019re over a year into the first one, the auto program and the uptake from different hospitals has been relatively slow; I think they are picking up on it and I think that\u2019s progressing. We\u2019ve got our own offering that you will start to hear about more this year. But in addition, what\u2019s equally significant is that CMS has introduced some cardiac bundles, and we are also in the process of coming up with offerings in those areas. We are actually -- we have a lot more experience and clear data that we already have of benefits that we can get by looking at the therapy over an extended period. So, we still are supportive, very supportive of CMS\u2019s move toward these value-based bundle payments. I think these programs have clear outcome measures. They identify the patient cohorts that get these treatments. And these are areas where we can have -- we can make contributions, both in the care pathway itself working with our physician customers and partners, as well as in technologies. So, we are very supportive of these, and we are seeing hospitals beginning to start to implement these procedures.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS.","Matt Miksic","So, I have got one, I want to dive a little deeper into the transcatheter valve business and also maybe just to touch deeper into spine. So, TAVR, put up a very strong worldwide number, better than what you are expecting and highlighted the impact of larger size valve. Mike, I was wondering if you could provide any color or tone on maybe the market by geography, for example referrals in the U.S. or other factors and let us [ph] recall on other dynamics, potentially impacting Europe? And then I had one follow-up on spine for Geoff.","Mike Coyle","Certainly, U.S. growth has been robust, high 30s for the U.S. market, I think it\u2019s being driven by two things, one is penetration into the intermediate risk, which of course we haven\u2019t had opportunity yet to participate in beyond our current trial enrollments, given that we don\u2019t have approval on that segment, but we do expect to get it here by the end of the summer. And then secondly, we have been taking share and exceeding the high risk patient population, principally driven by the presence of the 34 mm valve that was the segment that we described as being 30% of our mix. And that\u2019s proving to be true as we mobilize [ph] the market. But the other thing it does when we obviously have that full amount range of products is it lets you participate more broadly in the accounts. And so, we\u2019ve been expanding account penetration as well as expanding share in that segment. And obviously now the opportunity to bring Evolut PRO into the market, given its improvement in terms of both rates of PDL as well as reductions in pacemaker rates, we think really position us well to continue to kind of grow and pick share there.","Europe was much more of share capture story as 34 mm came in later there. So, it seems the same dynamic in the U.S. but we also obviously have the benefits of some market dynamics there with the Lotus recall [ph] opening an opportunity for us to take some additional share as well. So, we had meaningful sequential share capture taking place there. There are obviously other dynamics there with some of loading of shelves in Germany at one of our competitors that even when we -- when we shift that, we see very significant share capture. And obviously we are continuing momentum in the OUS markets, probably low-20s overall growth or so. So I think that pretty much summarizes where the market is.","Matt Miksic","And just to clarify, one of your colleagues in the U.S. market had talked about peers, I should say maybe not colleague but they have talked about smaller centers kind of surprising to upside in terms of productivity. Any color on that dynamic, the kind of core centers versus some of the newer TAVR centers?","Mike Coyle","Well, they certainly are and the attention in terms of improving the productivity of patient flow through those centers and we are seeing that. So, I think that is opening up capacity but we are also seeing more centers actually being able to qualify to be TAVR centers, and so that number is well over 500 now and we continue to participate in probably 450 of those and we are going to expand as we move into the intermediate risk. So, I think all centers realize how important it is to be able to participate here given the patient demand and just the clinical benefits for patients to get TAVR technology. So, we continue to see -- for capacity to grow within existing centers and then for new centers to come on stream.","Matt Miksic","And then, just -- thank you, Mike. And then, Geoff, the numbers for spine were also better than expected and in a market that frankly in the first quarter was maybe a little slower than we expected when we look across the group in general. And I wanted to just get a sense in the U.S. in particular, maybe just focus on, not so much the double digit, low double digit BMP growth but, but the core implants and rest of the business, the robots and any other initiatives, you mentioned a couple of products, what you call out in the U.S. that\u2019s helping sort of maybe reinvigorate that business a little bit?","Geoff Martha","Sure. I would say excluding biologics and to answer your question, I\u2019d say there is three things. One, it\u2019s a steady launch of these new products in core spine, so whether it\u2019d be inter body changes, [ph] or a fixation, a steady launch of those and doing that as we talked about before at scale. So, it\u2019s a more simplified -- it is a sales force. It\u2019s a more -- and a lot of physician partners. So, we\u2019re launching these things in a steady cadence, a purposeful cadence, it\u2019s tied to procedures and when we launch them, we launch them at scale, all the stats, all the training, all that is happening in a tight window, much tighter window than we used to. We used to do this over nine quarters; we\u2019re now doing it over two. And that is having an impact in and of itself. So, the number of products, steady cadence and the way we\u2019re launching it at speed and scale initiative we\u2019ve been talking about.","The second is the surgical synergy strategy. So, our view on -- a lot of people like to call it robotics and I think that\u2019s kind of a shallow thinking quite frankly. As we look at this, it\u2019s way beyond the robotic arm, it\u2019s a bunch of enabling technologies like navigation or operator imaging, the robotic arm, surgical planning, all this technology come together to go after these procedures and lower the cost or improve the clinical outcomes; that we\u2019re not placing a lot of that technology in exchange for incremental implant volume. And so that is having another impact. So that\u2019s the second big impact, because as we place that equipment in exchange for incremental volume. And then the third is our sales force is reinvigorated. They are seeing all this coming and what the future holds. And so they are very excited. And a lot of the competitor reps that are coming are also helping as well.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust Robinson. ","Bruce Nudell","A couple of quick questions for Mike and then one for Omar. So, Mike, your PCR and I was really struck by the net clinical benefit of left atrial appendage closure. Given the limitations of oral and quad [ph] therapy, is Medtronic in play and how big do you think that market gets? Secondly, [indiscernible] it was kind of hinted that the U.S. pivotal four transcatheter mitral valve replacement might start this year 2017, how big is that trial; how long might it take? And then for Omar, I met with a TAVR company from China yesterday and the price point is 25 grand but reimbursement is only to the tune of 30% or so. So, the question is, should we forever think of some of these emerging markets as low technology or basic technology plays or might that situation for high-tech stuff change over time? Thanks so much.","Mike Coyle","Bruce to answer your question, just starting on LAA, that\u2019s the segment we don\u2019t currently participate in; that\u2019s a segment that our business development team keeps a pretty close watch on. We think there are puts and takes with the existing technology we think there maybe some better ways to go about this, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet that has caused us to want to jump in. But it\u2019s like anything else, we continue to look at it and then the progress follow the market and then technology that it is available. And then on your question around TMVR, it would be pretty mature to talk about this specific study design. We\u2019re still in discussions with FDA and what that might look like. We are now at essentially 50 implants with our existing intrepid system. We are increasingly enthused that we have the right design to go into clinical trials and we are working on the study design with FDA and will probably have more to say about that over the next quarter or two.","Omar Ishrak","I think on the China question, that\u2019s actually a very good question, in terms of emerging markets in general. As these markets go to universal coverage, there will be a tendency to kind of homogenize the products. I think that\u2019s sort of encouraged us to take our value based healthcare analysis and business models to these emerging markets much more rapidly and in a much more accelerated fashion than we were thinking because the key to getting the differentiated pricing, if you like, is to demonstrate differentiated outcomes, which we think we can. And so that\u2019s how this is going to go and play there as well. We will demonstrate additional value with these differentiated products. If there is no value, we shouldn\u2019t be getting more price. And so, I think that\u2019s the way we have reported and it\u2019s really a slight sort of reprioritization of our own strategies in the sense of the value based healthcare effort is now getting increasing traction in some of these emerging markets. We\u2019ve previously thought that that was in access only situation but we think now access couple with value based healthcare, in fact making sure that we get differentiated products with fair pricing in all these markets as universal coverage kicks in.","Karen Parkhill","Before we end Q&A, I want to correct a statement that I made on the guidance around the quarterly gating. We do expect revenue growth for the full year, as I said, to be in the 4% to 5% range and looking at the first quarter, I had said the fourth quarter but I meant to say the first quarter. Looking at the first quarter, we would expect total Medtronic revenue growth to be similar to that annual range.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Thank you, Karen. And thanks to all of you for your questions. On behalf of the entire management team, I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q1 call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, August the 22nd. Thank you all very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's Second Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to hand the program over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead.","Jeff Warren","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2013 second quarter which ended October 26, 2012. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","First a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements, and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available in the Investor's portion of our website at medtronic.com. And finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2012, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.","With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar S. Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported second quarter revenue of $4.1 billion, which represents growth of 5%. Q2 non-GAAP earnings of $902 million were flat, and diluted earnings per share of $0.88 increased 5%. Our GAAP earnings include a non-cash charge related to our ongoing litigation in our TAVI business, and Gary will discuss this item in a little more detail later.","Building on the last couple of quarters, Q2 represented another positive step toward our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth on both the top and bottom line. In fact, we believe our organic revenue growth outperformed the MedTech market by 200 basis points with a number of businesses and geographies that delivered outstanding performances but at the same time, there were businesses and geographies that face some pressures, and we're watching these very carefully. Overall, we're focusing on effectively managing headwinds and tailwinds to deliver a balanced and consistent performance.  This quarter, 2 of our larger end markets, U.S. ICD and U.S. Spine, continued to show signs of stabilization. Growth in both these markets were relatively stable sequentially, and we also executed well and took share in both of these important markets.","Let's first discuss U.S. ICDs in more detail. Similar to last quarter, we estimate the market declined in the mid-single digits. Our business was down 3%, enabling us to gain approximately 1 point of share year-over-year and 2.5 points sequentially. Pricing declined 3%, a slight improvement to last quarter's rate. Concurrently, our implant volumes improved sequentially and were up over 5%. While hospitals continue to reduce their bulk purchases on a year-over-year basis, they were relatively stable sequentially. These positive implant trends suggest that the U.S. market stabilization will continue.","Turning now to U.S. Core Spine. We estimate that the overall markets are modest year-over-year decline without any fundamental shift sequentially in the underlying dynamics. Market procedures declined in the low single digits, and positive mix offset pricing declines. Looking at our own results, our U.S. Core Spine business was down 4%, with Q2 being the most difficult comparison from last year. Our year-over-year and sequential growth was also affected by the timing of the NASS Annual Meeting, which occurred during the last week of the quarter. Despite these headwinds, it is worth noting that our U.S. Core Spine business was sequentially flat and delivered modest share gains. Our business continues to stabilize, driven by the increasing broad surgeon acceptance of our new products and procedures. We're also differentiating our Spine business to enabling technologies, such as O-Arm imaging, StealthStation navigation and POWEREASE powered surgical instruments. This is also evidenced by the strong growth in our U.S. navigation business, which grew over 35%.","Hospitals continue to invest in our capital equipment for spine surgery, as they see clear value from better outcomes in more efficient procedures. This is also resulting in significant pull through from navigation in power-enabled spinal implants. We believe that there's progress, but there is still only on the leading edge of this large opportunity, and we need to continue to drive navigation to become the standard of care in spine procedures.","The other part of our U.S. Spine business, BMP, declined 20% in Q2. Pressure will continue to exist in this portion of the business until the questions around INFUSE are better clarified. Yale continues to work on finalizing its report and while the timing is controlled by them, we are now expecting the systematic reviews to be published in the early 2013.  Looking at the remainder of our businesses, we had a number of standout performances with new products where we're making a difference. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, our Resolute Integrity Drug Eluting Stent continues to perform well. Our U.S. DES share is still improving and in Japan, our share has more than doubled since we launched the Resolute Integrity stent early in the quarter.  Across the balance of our CBG portfolio, we are seeing double-digit growth in AF, TAVI, aortic stent grafts and our peripheral vascular product lines.  In our Restorative Therapies Group, our neuromodulation business continued a strong performance with double-digit growth in pain stim, DBS and InterStim.","In pain stim, our RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator gained share again this quarter. Our DBS business also had a strong quarter, with our referral development efforts enabling more patients to receive our pioneering Activa therapy. Our Uro\/Gastro business is performing well with its expanded indications for InterStim Therapy.  Surgical Technologies had a stellar quarter, growing 17% with double-digit growth across all 3 businesses: ENT, neuro surgery and Advanced Energy. Even after excluding the impact of our acquisition of last year, which we have now anniversaried, Surgical Technologies grew 13%.","In Diabetes, our CGM business also grew double digits. While we are executing on our product launches, we're also making progress in advancing our industry-leading product pipeline. Before the end of the fiscal year, we expect to receive U.S. approval for our MiniMed 530G insulin pump and sensor system in diabetes and CE Mark and CIVM [ph] for our Viva and Evera high power family. In FY '14, we are targeting the launch of our Advisa MRI pacemaker in the U.S. and our next-generation Multi Electrode Renal Denervation System in Europe. We're also planning the European launch of our next-generation insulin pump, the MiniMed 640G system early next fiscal year and finally, we continue to execute on bringing our transcatheter valves and renal denervation products to the U.S. market, expecting to launch both CoreValve and Symplicity in FY '15.","Turning to international. Our revenue grew 8%, and improvement over the growth rate last quarter was relative stability in Western Europe and improving growth both in Japan and in emerging markets. Western Europe grew 3%, but the market conditions varied significantly country by country. Growth was stronger in the U.K., Germany, France and the Nordics, all delivering mid-single-digit growth or better, partially offset by softness in Southern Europe. In fact Italy, Spain and Portugal combined negatively affected our Western Europe growth rate by 2 percentage points. Italy was particularly soft this quarter, declining 3% as we started to see significant pricing and volume pressure in October. These pressures in Southern Europe are affecting the overall market, and we continue to monitor the situation very closely as we manage this headwind going forward.","Japan had a strong quarter with growth of 12%, more than absorbing the unfavorable impact of R-Zone pricing that went into effect in April. In addition to Resolute Integrity's strong performance that I have mentioned earlier, several new products are making a difference in Japan. We're seeing great acceptance for Endurant, which has quickly become the leading AAA stent graft in Japan. In CRDM, the launch of our Advisa MRI Pacemaker late in the quarter helped drive mid-single-digit pacing growth. Our pain stim business is also experiencing strong growth in Japan with RestoreSensor gaining 10 points of share year-over-year.","Turning to emerging markets. Our Q2 growth rate was 18%, a 400 basis point improvement from our growth rate last quarter. Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa and India all grew above 20%. And although China's growth of 11% was below our long-term target, it is worth noting that results were significantly affected by the decreased revenue from our Weigao joint venture, following our announcement to part China Kanghui Holdings. We are in active discussions with Weigao about the future, and we are working to minimize disruptions to our business as we position ourselves for long-term success in the broader China orthopedics market. We're putting plans in place in all our China businesses to achieve our long-term growth goals, and we expect steady improvement going forward.","While emerging markets in total have not quite met our 20% growth goal the last couple of quarters, I strongly believe that as we're executing our strategies, we will achieve this level of performance consistently over the long-term. We feel that continued emerging market growth, combined with market stabilization, as well as our broad portfolio and strong pipeline of future products, provides the foundation to deliver dependable top and bottom line growth over the midterm. In addition, we are executing on our long-term strategies of creating economic value and further accelerating globalization in order to achieve the upside to our baseline expectations. In support of our globalization strategy, we took steps this quarter in both of our groups to become a long-term leader in the emerging market value segment.","In CVG, we announced our intent to purchase an equity interest in LifeTech Scientific Corporation, a leading China-based developer of minimally invasive cardio and peripheral vascular devices. Our agreement will allow us to distribute certain LifeTech products, as well as the option to acquire additional ownership of the company.  In addition to their current Structural Heart product lines, LifeTech also has a robust development pipeline, including surgical heart valves, LAA closure devices and peripheral vascular products. With this alliance, we intend to bring together the resources of Medtronic with the local market expertise, brand recognition and growth potential of LifeTech.","In September, we also announced our acquisition of Kanghui, a leading Chinese orthopedics company. Kanghui has a broad portfolio of trauma and spine products focused on the growing value segment, and they are just beginning to expand into a large joint reconstruction. The company has a strong local R&D, manufacturing, distribution and emerging market export capabilities. We recently closed the transaction, and we welcome the Kanghui employees to the Medtronic family.  Both Kanghui and LifeTech are significant investments in China, fully aligned with our globalization strategy. They immediately give us critical mass of knowledge and expertise in the specific need of the Chinese market and patients. It is also important to note that both deals exceeded our high financial return hurdles, which is my expectation with any investment or acquisition that we make.","In addition to executing in our globalization strategy, we're also continuing to make progress in our economic value initiative. As I meet with payers and healthcare system administrators, I remain convinced that our breadth and scale, combined with economic value, will differentiate our company in the changing healthcare environment. We're making economic value more granular across all of our businesses and geographies. We are implementing the science that will help us translate economic value principles into a real advantage not only for us, but also for our customers. Improving our operating rigor remains key to fully capitalizing on our long-term strategies. We are making progress in reducing our product cost by $1.2 billion over the next 5 years. This is important not only to maintain our gross margins, but it also fuels the development of clear products, which are essential to creating new value segment opportunities. In addition, our strategies to improve working capital by increasing our inventory turns are beginning to gain traction. Not only does this instill good fiscal discipline, but it will strengthen our already robust levels of free cash flow generation. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P Dividend Aristocrat, Medtronic has a long track record of consistently increasing our dividend. We believe the level of our shareholder return commitment is appropriate, given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. The remaining 50% gives us ample flexibility to make investments with sustainable growth, and we are and will continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy this capital with a particular focus on returns. We expect any M&A transaction to pass -- to surpass our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate, and we do not intend to pass along EPS dilution to our shareholders.  Our belief is that our strong capital allocation policy combined with consistent and dependable growth, which we will deliver by executing in our near, mid- and long-term growth drivers, will create sustainable shareholder value.","Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take any questions. Gary?","Gary L. Ellis","Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $4,095,000,000 increased 2% as reported and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $118 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q2 revenue results by region were as follows: growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 26%; Latin America grew 23%; growth in Middle East and Africa was 22%; south Asia grew 21%; growth in Greater China was 11%; Asia-Pacific grew 10%, including 12% growth in Japan; growth in Western Europe and Canada was 3%, while the U.S. grew 2%; emerging markets grew a combined 18% in Q2, and represented 11% of our total sales mix.","Q2 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $646,000,000 and $0.63, a decrease of 26% and 23%, respectively. These declines were due to a litigation charge resulting from the recent Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmation of the April 2010 jury verdict in the Federal District Court of Delaware related to our Structural Heart business. Based on this ruling, we believe the one-time non-cash $245 million pretax charge represents our best estimate of the exposure at this time. After adjusting for this certain litigation charge as well as certain acquisition-related items and the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, second quarter earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $902 million and $0.88, flat and an increase of 5% respectively. Adjusting for the net gains related to the Advanced Energy acquisition of PEAK and Salient in Q2 last year, non-GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share increased 4% and 9%, respectively.","In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2,137,000,000 grew 6%. Results were driven by solid growth in Coronary, Endovascular, Structural Heart and AF Solutions, partially offset by declines in Pacing. CRDM revenue of $1,227,000,000 was flat. Worldwide ICD revenue of $689 million was flat. Our Protecta ICD, with its shock reduction and lead integrity alert technologies, combined with the proven long-term performance of our Sprint Quattro leads, continues to receive strong market acceptance. We gained over 200 basis points of global ICD share sequentially, and our share is now at the highest level in 10 quarters. We were also pleased to see our lead-to-port ratios continue to increase, and our replacement market share is up nearly 400 basis points.","Pacing revenue of $480 million declined 2%, slightly better than our estimate of the global market. Our U.S. Pacing revenue declined 8% in line with the market. These declines were driven primarily by pricing, which was down in the mid-single digits and to a lesser extent, hospital inventory reductions and fewer industry replacement procedures. We captured share in our international markets on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, driven in part by the launch of our Advisa MRI pacemaker in Japan, a device that we expect to launch in the U.S. market at the beginning of next fiscal year.  Our AF Solutions business grew 20% globally, with U.S. growth in excess of 30%. Growth was driven by the strong global performance of our next-generation Arctic Front Advance balloon with EvenCool Cryo Technology as we continue to gain market share.","Coronary revenue of $429 million grew 19%, as our Resolute Integrity drug-eluting stent continued to capture global share. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $258 million, including $99 million in the U.S. Resolute Integrity's deliverability, unique FDA labeling for diabetes and long-term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally. As Omar mentioned, we more than doubled our DES share in Japan to 16%, with the late August launch of Resolute Integrity and exited the quarter with good momentum.","In renal denervation, we continue to lay the groundwork for this important opportunity. On the clinical front, 18 months data from HTN-2 was announced at ESC. And while still on a limited number of patients, the data showed SYMPLICITY continues to provide superior and sustained blood pressure reduction in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension while maintaining safety. We are also advancing our renal denervation pipeline, completing the first stage of our First-In-Man Study for our next-generation multi-electrode system.","As we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in June, this system is expected to reduce average total ablation time from 16 minutes to 24 minutes today to 2 minutes total, and all through a 6 per inch catheter. We believe this product will further strengthen our leadership position in this important MedTech growth market. Commercially, while SYMPLICITY is available in many international markets, we lack broad reimbursement for the therapy which is affecting the update, and will likely remain that way until we get additional clinical data. While SYMPLICITY revenue is ramping somewhat slower than expected, we still believe our technology, strong clinical data and robust intellectual property represents a large multibillion-dollar opportunity.","Turning to Structural Heart. Revenue of $271 million increased 6%, driven by double-digit growth in TAVI. While market growth slowed in Europe, we continue to leverage our innovative portfolio for global expansion, and are leading in introduction of new valves, sizes and the imitations that are driving growth and serving more patients. We are continuing to rollout our CoreValve Evolut 23-millimeter valve, which promotes better sealing and provides future re-capturability. With Evolut, we are now able to serve the broadest range of TAVI patients on a common 18 French delivery system.","In Q2, positive data on direct aortic implantation was presented at London Valves, and we continue to see increased adoption of this innovative implant technique by cardiac surgeons.  We also completed enrollment in the high-risk arm of our U.S. pivotal trial as we continue to make progress in bringing CoreValve to the U.S. market. In transapical, the first results from the Engager European Pivotal Trial were presented in October, which showed positive clinical outcomes, including exceptional hemodynamic performance. Finally, we were honored that our Melody Pulmonary Transcatheter Valve received the prestigious Prix Galien USA 2012 Award for the best medical technology, which is our industry's highest accolade.","Turning to endovascular. Revenue of $210 million grew 17%, with strong balanced growth across our intra-aortic and peripheral businesses. In aortic, we gained global AAA share on both a sequential and year-over-year basis, driven in part by the launch of Endurant in Japan, as well as the continued acceptance of Endurant II on our other global markets. Thoracic sales grew double digits on the strength of Valiant Captivia in the U.S. and China. In peripheral, our global share also continues to decline, with double-digit growth in our clinical stent business. We completed enrollment in our IN.PACT Drug-Eluting Balloon trial for our below-the-knee indication in international markets.","Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1,958,000,000 grew 4%. Results were driven by growth in Surgical Technologies, neuromodulation and Diabetes, partially offset by declines in spine. Spine revenue of $782 million declined 5% globally and 8% in the U.S., primarily driven by declines in BMP. Core Spine revenue of $649 million declined 2% globally and 4% in the U.S. While the spine market declined, we are not seeing any significant changes sequentially in the underlying market conditions including procedure trends, pricing pressure or competitive dynamics. It is worth noting that our Core Spine business grew on a sequential basis. We are seeing signs of improvement in our business as new products and procedures continue to perform well.","In thoracolumbar, our Solera system rolled out its core capability, and we are now at 70% of set capacity. Solera, with its advanced biomechanics and new capabilities, including its attractive combination of navigation and powered instruments, is generating strong surgeon interest.  In cervical, we launched our BRYAN ACD and based on its acceptance in other countries, we believe this disk will allow us to capture significant share in a growing $100 million-plus U.S. market.  In interbody we launched our AMT implants, as well as the CAPSTONE CONTROL, and we believe that in addition to improving our interbody growth, these innovative implants will generate pull-through revenue for the rest of our thoracolumbar portfolio.","Our Other Biologics products had double-digit growth, with continued adoption of our Grafton and MagniFuse DVMs. In BMP, revenue of $133 million declined 19%, including a 20% decline in the U.S. It is important to note that BMP is one of our lower margin products, muting its impact on the bottom line. We expect the Yale Systematic Reviews on INFUSE to be published in the first calendar quarter of 2013.","Surgical Technologies revenue of $344 million grew 17%, which included $35 million of revenue from Advanced Energy. Organic revenue growth was 13%, driven by double-digit growth in ENT and neurosurgery. Neurosurgery in particular had a very solid quarter, led by strong U.S. sales of our high-value O-arm imaging and StealthStation S7 navigation capital equipment. Our capital equipment is driving solid results, and we believe we continue to gain share. Our strong performance also reflects increased surgeon demand for our differentiated navigated spine procedural solutions.","Turning to neuro modulation. Revenue of $454 million increased 10%. Our pain stim business continued its recent track record of double-digit growth, driven by sales of our RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator with AdaptiveStim technology. In DBS, we had another strong quarter of double-digit growth, as our referral channel development efforts have led to strong new implant growth. Also growing double digits this quarter was our Uro\/Gastro business, driven by the adoption of our InterStim Therapy. Across neuromodulation, our investment in markets outside the United States and in Western Europe are starting to show results, our Q2 growth of over 25% in each geographies.","Diabetes revenue of $378 million grew 6%, driven by double-digit growth in CGM. In the U.S., we are anticipating FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump and Enlite Sensor to occur in late FY '13, which we expect to reaccelerate growth in the U.S. We also continue to make progress in our next-generation MiniMed 640G pump, which we expect to launch in Western Europe early next fiscal year.","Turning to the rest of the income statement. Q2 gross margin was 75.1%. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, our gross margin was 75.6%, but gross margin was also unfavorably affected this quarter by approximately 30 basis points related to one-time items, including obsolescence charges from new product launches and one-time integration-related activities. We continue to offset pricing pressure through our 5-year $1.2 billion cost of goods reduction program. For the remainder of FY '13, we expect gross margins to be approximately 75.5%, excluding the negative -- expected negative impact of foreign currency.","Second quarter R&D spending of $387 million was 9.5% of revenue, which was driven by higher clinical spending in transcatheter valves and renal denervation. We remain committed to investing in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. And for the remainder of FY '13, we expect R&D spending to be in the range of 9% to 9.5%.","Second quarter SG&A expenditures of $1,417,000,000 represented 34.6% of sales versus 35% in the second quarter last year. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses, while at the same time investing in new product launches and adding to our sales force and faster growing businesses and geographies. In FY '13, we continue to expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement.  Amortization expense for the quarter was $79 million. For the remainder of FY '13, we would expect amortization expense in the range of approximately $90 million for the quarter, an increase due to the Kanghui acquisition. However, as we have previously stated, we intend to offset this dilution.","Net other expense for the quarter was $63 million. Net losses from our hedging programs were $27 million during the quarter. As you know, we hedge much of our operating results to reduce the volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. In Q2, our hedging losses were greater than expected due to a one time hedging issue related to a balance sheet exposure during a period of significant change in euro exchange rates. We have taken steps to prevent this from occurring in the future, and we were able to cover the impact to earnings to realized gains in our minority investment and debt security portfolios. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY '13 net other expense will be in the range of $215 million to $235 million. This includes the expected impact from the U.S. medical device tax that will begin in January and higher royalty expense due to increased sales of Resolute Integrity. For Q3, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $24 million. Excluding the $23 million non-cash charge with convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $1 million. Interest expense was lighter than expected in Q2 due to the one time gain that helped to offset the previously mentioned increased hedging expense. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $11.5 billion in cash and cash investments and $11.5 billion of debt. For the remainder of FY '13, we expect non-GAAP net interest expense to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the quarter, which excludes the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.","Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 24.4%. Excluding the impact of one time items, our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q2 was 20%. For FY '13, we expected adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19.5% to 20.5%. This does not include any benefit for the U.S. R&D tax credit, which has not yet been extended by Congress. Historically, the R&D tax credit has an annual benefit in the range of $30 million to $35 million or approximately $0.01 per quarter. In the first half of FY '13, we generated nearly $2 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","During Q2, we repurchased $614 million of our common stock or approximately 1% of our outstanding shares. As of the end of Q2, we have remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 31 million shares. Second quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,028,000,000 shares.","Let me conclude by commenting on our fiscal year 2013 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We are tightening our constant currency revenue growth outlook to 3% to 4% for FY '13. This implies a continued outlook of 2% to 4% constant currency revenue growth for the second half of FY '13, which we believe remains reasonable and conservative. Although we can not predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY '13 revenue will be unfavorably affected by approximately $305 million to $345 million, including an unfavorable $40 million to $60 million impact in Q3.","Turning to guidance on the bottom line. Given the uncertainty surrounding final IRS implementation guidelines of the U.S. medical device tax, and as well as the uncertain renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit, we continue to remain conservative and expect FY '13 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.62 to $3.70, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year, nor do they include the impact of the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.","I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?","Omar S. Ishrak","Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me conclude by reiterating that we were encouraged by Q2 results, but we recognize that it was only another step toward achieving our goal of delivering consistent and dependable growth. While we continue to manage a number of headwinds, we believe that our leading portfolio and pipeline, combined with stabilization in emerging markets and continued strong growth in emerging markets, position us well to deliver on our baseline expectations over the mid-term, and these baseline expectations are: consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth; consistent EPS growth, 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. At the same time, we are also preparing to be a leader in the transformation of global healthcare by implementing our long-term strategy of economic value and globalization. We are only at the beginning of our journey, but we believe that crisp execution of both our baseline and long-term growth strategies, combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long-term value in healthcare.","With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Michael Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; and Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group, to join us again for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Gary, I want to come back to one of your comments on gross margins. You mentioned sort of the one-time effects in this quarter. But if we go back, it was one of the strongest revenue quarters in 2-plus-years, but the margins were one of the weaker ones in the last 2 years even though it's kind of in line with where you had margins in the third quarter of '11 when you also had some one-time impact. So I guess adjusted for the one-time impacts, are we seeing the beginning of your very strong performance in emerging markets beginning to weigh somewhat on gross margins?","Gary L. Ellis","I mean not a lot, David. I mean overall, obviously we're fighting headwinds as we do see growth in the -- some of the emerging markets, and we've continued to see pricing pressure across a lot of our businesses, which again for the most part, we've been able to offset with product cost reductions. So the way we look at it, our standard gross margins, which gets prior to some of the -- our other product lines, which are more onetime in nature, the standard gross margins are relatively holding relatively firm. We haven't seen a big change in that over the last several quarters, and we didn't see that in this quarter either. So that's why it was primarily one-time issues. We had some obsolescence obviously related to the fact that Resolute Integrity is doing much, much better than we've expected, and obviously a more obsolescence with endeavor as a result of that. We had some other integration costs as we do some of these acquisitions that are more onetime in nature that are affecting the gross margins. So overall, I don't want to make light of it because I think there are pressures on the gross margin that we've seen for the last several years, but we've managed that relatively well. It's more of the one-time items that had an impact on us in the quarter, plus FX, obviously.","Omar S. Ishrak","And also, I think if I can add very quickly, the emerging markets themselves, the sort of products we're selling, the pricing environment is not that different from certainly Western Europe.","Gary L. Ellis","That's correct.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just a kind of a follow-up question related to growth. So we think about the growth in the first half of the year, 5% constant currency, the strongest growth we've seen in the last 2 years. You've got multiple product lines, like neuromod, where growth is the strongest we've seen in 3 years, maybe you can just talk to us about your view that the second half of the year will slow incrementally off the first half of the year, what are some of the driving factors of that? Or does that simply reflect conservatism given the environment?","Omar S. Ishrak","I think there is some conservatism regarding the environment. We obviously intend to drive growth as aggressively as we can and -- but look, there's all kinds of headwinds. Western Europe, for example, has a lot of uncertainty built around Southern Europe, and there's a fair amount of pricing pressure in some of these markets. So overall, there's enough -- still enough uncertainty out there in the marketplace that it's best for us to give the guidance that we just did. There's -- in the U.S., we're going to get through the end of the year, and the policy implications that will be put in to place and again, there's uncertainty there. So I think we have to take into account that headwinds will come our way, and we'll do our very best to manage them, and we certainly will drive growth as aggressively as we can, but I think the guidance that we put out is probably maybe somewhat conservative, but we want to be realistic about this.","Omar S. Ishrak","I think there is some conservatism regarding the environment. We obviously intend to drive growth as aggressively as we can. And -- but, look, there's all kinds of headwinds. Western Europe, for example, has a lot of uncertainty built around it. Southern Europe, and there's a severe amount of pricing pressure in some of these markets. So overall, there's enough -- still enough uncertainty out there in the marketplace that it's best for us to give the guidance that we just did. There is, in the U.S., we are going to get through the end of the year and the policy implications that will be put into place and again, there's uncertainty there. So I think we have to take into account that headwinds will come our way, and we'll do our very best to manage them, and we certainly will drive growth as aggressively as we can. But I think the guidance that we put out is probably maybe somewhat conservative, but we want to be realistic about this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just might cut across a few of you, but following up on David's question on the growth second half of the year. If you look at this quarter, the one market that really jumped is Japan, and that's your biggest international market. And it was driven by a bunch of different products. You had the Resolute Integrity, Endurant. You highlighted Advisa MRI, RestoreSensor. Why couldn't that market continue to be strong the next, say, 2 to 4 quarters, and more than offset some of the issues in Western Europe?","Omar S. Ishrak","Well, it's good. I mean we expect Japan to be strong. We were very excited about what we're seeing in Japan. In fact, the Resolute Integrity will have its first full quarter of launch this coming quarter. So I think there is -- it's certainly in the next 12 months or so, Japan is going to be -- definitely going to be one of our premier growth engines. We're just balancing everything here, Matt. There's no concrete headwinds and tailwinds that we can lay our hands on, we just know that there's still enough uncertainty out there that you just cannot tell. And certainly, if you just look at the overall economic environment, there are pressures across the world. And you just need one of them to fall into a crisis level and it could take a lot of tailwinds from a market like Japan, away, and we just have to be careful with that. And that's really all I can say around that. But certainly, we have high expectations from the Japan market, and those, I think, we'll realize.","Gary L. Ellis","We, obviously, Matt, can't say much more to what Omar said. I mean obviously, we don't expect Japan -- we expect Japan to be very, very strong. We saw increased growth in the emerging markets, most of our markets, even Europe, obviously, had a very strong growth compared to some markets this quarter. So our teams continue to do very, very well, and we feel good about that. But as Omar said, there's just -- there's so much uncertainty in the marketplace right now. We are still being -- maybe we're being viewed as somewhat cautious, but we feel that's the appropriate thing right now. And we'll continue to execute, but you're absolutely right. There was a lot of strong points in this quarter that if the -- if those things continue, we should expect...","Omar S. Ishrak","I mean, we don't get surprises. Negative surprises. I think because the tailwinds that we have, by and large, we think will continue, and we're seeing pretty good momentum there. But you just never know what headwinds come our way, and we just need to be cautious about that.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just one little quick, and that was a lot of answers. Gary, on the FX, on the other income, versus expectations, was it right to think about that as a $0.02 to $0.03 hit, the difference in what should have been and what you ended up losing?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. It was about -- it was a couple of cent impact for our -- what we had there in the quarter. And as we said in some of my comments, we saw that early in the quarter. It happened in August. We saw it and we took steps to offset it in taking some gains out of the debt minority investment portfolio. But it was a couple of cents, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So let me -- Omar, let me get you just to comment a little bit more about Europe. And we saw with a lot of other companies reporting through their September quarters commentary about Europe. I know you guys commented about Italy. Could you just talk about how you feel about the health of those markets going, particularly into the largest countries' fiscal year ends and whether you're seeing any slowdown in procedure volumes or purchasing in particular geographies?","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. Well first of all, look, the underlying demand is going to be there for sorts of products that we sell. So that's going to be there in the long-term. Now given that there's clearly pressure from a volume perspective in Italy, which we've already seen going towards the end of the fiscal year certainly. And also not only in volume, but also we anticipate some level of pricing pressure in Italy. Now with the lower pricing that might increase on volume at some point in the future, we haven't seen that yet. Now Greece also, although there's a -- the business is reasonably okay there, let's say, yes, we still have to watch collections which are out there and see how the market performs in terms of our receivables. And that might put constraint in how fast we can grow there. Spain, too. Actually we have been collecting there and all the way, the tougher quarter, the outlook is improving a little bit. But in all of these Southern European markets, at any time, policies could come into place which would simply ration the volume, primarily because of budgetary reasons with Nordic consideration, short-term move by the governments to just stop volume to save money and just as simple as that, that can easily happen and that's essentially what we're seeing in Europe. Now we're working the best we can to manage that in that environment, and we are also trying to structure our product lines so that even in that environment, we can show that we provide economic value. But that's on the traditional way of doing business and over a quarter or 2, we'll just have to face that kind of volume pressure.","Gary L. Ellis","And as we said on the comments, Mike, I mean, France, Germany, the U.K. and the Nordic, there's still, I think, strong growth in both -- I mean, especially in volume in those markets. So we're not -- we could see some -- a little  bit of a slowdown as we get to the end of the calendar year that we normally see, but then we'll see a pick up again for ourselves in January as the new budgets come in effect. So as Omar said, I mean we're very cautious, especially about some of the Southern European countries and we're watching Europe in general, just overall. But some of the countries are continuing to see very strong growth.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. You touched on it briefly, just -- could you just comment a little bit more on the Edwards litigation? And, a, what you're doing to shift your manufacturing relative to your existing business outside of the U.S. and b, how you think about this impacting your timing or plans for U.S. launch?","Omar S. Ishrak","Okay. First of all, we are making good progress in shifting our manufacturing, and most of it is already complete and we intend to complete that very, very shortly. So by and large, we think we'll get our volume outside the U.S. very shortly. At this stage, we're planning U.S. launch as driven by our clinical trials. And I think it's in the FY '14 that we are planning the U.S. -- FY '15 we're planning the U.S. launch, and that is what we're planning for. And we don't expect this litigation to have any material impact on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So quick question on the pipeline, especially TAVI in Europe. I think in the last couple of quarters, you guys have said that you're comfortable, that you think the TAVI market in Europe could be growing 15% to 18%. I assume that outlook has changed now. But I would just love to get some comments from you on what you think of the outlook for TAVI in Europe going forward given current market conditions.","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. I think -- look, the procedures -- I was just in Europe recently, and there is a strong demand there, and we're extending the patient base there. But there are some pressures in Europe. I'll let Mike comment on this. I mean, we just introduced a new product there as well which we expect to help. But Mike's going to [indiscernible].","Michael J. Coyle","Sure. At the start of the fiscal year, we were thinking it was a reasonable expectation to look for 15% kind of growth in the market. That has contracted somewhat, and I think we're looking now at that sort of high single-digit growth based on the numbers that have been reported so far this year. This is one of the procedures that I think is getting a lot of scrutiny from just the reimbursement perspective, and there are drags being put on the procedure volumes as a result of that. Now on the other hand, we are very robust in product introduction cycle there with the Evolut 23-millimeter product that's been released. We obviously released our Engager data and expect -- we did CE Mark for that in the near-term, and that's going to give us an opportunity to continue to drive share. We actually think we took market share in the addressable market in Europe here during the last quarter. So we think we are looking at a slowdown versus what we had expected at the start of the fiscal year. But it's -- it does still look like high single-digit kind of growth.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Mike, 2 other quick things. One, can you comment on what you're seeing from a pricing perspective in TAVI in Europe? Is there any incremental pressure there from your perspective? And then any update you could provide on the U.S. trial for renal denervation? Are we still on track there for completion in the time lines that you provided previously?","Michael J. Coyle","So on pricing for TAVI, they're totally up very well. We've not seen any real pricing pressure there, it's been more of the procedure volume pressure that we've seen there that has resulted in this bit of a slowdown from what we had thought at the start of the fiscal year. On the TAVI, or on the renal denervation activities in thee U.S., we continue to aggressively pursue enrollment in the SYMPLICITY HTN-3 trial. As we've said in the past, this is a challenging trial to enroll. It's turning out that we have to enroll more patients than we had expected to get to the number we want randomized. And that at the moment with the enrollment rates, is looking like it's going to be a challenge to get that completely enrolled by the end of the fiscal year, so this could spill into next year. However, we have a number of plans that we are putting in place to try to accelerate that similarly as we can implement sort of, unilaterally. Other ones, we'd have to work with FDA to get some modifications to the protocol. We are pushing on those fronts, and we're going to do everything we can to get that enrolled as quickly as possible. On the other hand, we think we can actually accelerate some of the commercialization aspects in the U.S. from the standpoint that we had originally expected there be a gap in time between FDA approval and then getting CMS reimbursement approval. We are now trying to pursue a parallel path for those 2 which, we think, would allow us to accelerate the ramp once we get approved in the U.S. So those things are balancing sort of against each other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A follow-up on Bob's question. Just with the renal denervation in the U.S., just want to make sure, your prior, I guess, assumption for the completion of enrollment had been calendar first quarter, I guess, of '13 and now, you're saying that's going to be more calendar kind of midyear?","Omar S. Ishrak","Mike...","Michael J. Coyle","Based on the current run rate, that's where would be expect to be coming in.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And you're still comfortable with the FY '15 approval time line?","Michael J. Coyle","That would still work with an FY '15 approval time line.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on just x, I guess U.S. sales, you guys had originally expected I think it was $60 million to $70 million in FY '13. Can you maybe just comment on where you are now? I know that you had reimbursement was constrained. But what are you also seeing from other competitive perspective given that there's several other renal denervation systems approved for use as well?","Michael J. Coyle","We don't see the competitive pressures being the big issue. It is more the ability to -- with the fact that we don't have separate reimbursement in many countries for this technology. So our overall coronary renal denervation revenue numbers are very much in line. In fact, they are tracking ahead of what we had provided as guidance at the Analyst Meeting. There is more in the Coronary and slightly less in the renal denervation side than we had been talking about. But on balance, we are in good shape in terms of the revenue growth for that business. I would point out that because there is no separate reimbursement for renal denervation in a lot of these countries, what we're seeing is a very high desire to do the cases but no budgets to do it. We are using the breadth of our cardiovascular product line to basically provide opportunities for incremental growth of other parts of our business in exchange for credits that can be applied to these non-reimbursed market segments. And that is giving us an opportunity to grow revenues broadly across the group based on our ability to offer renal denervation as a therapy option.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then what would be the path for the multi electrode system in the United States?","Michael J. Coyle","What would be the path?  We are still working with FDA on what the regulatory path for that would be. As we've mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've now completed the first phase of our first-in-man activities at very good results. We are now focused on CE Mark studies for that and then we are working with FDA on what regulatory treatment would be for that product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions for you, Omar. First, 5% constant currency growth in the first half and 2% to 4% is the guidance in the second half, and the conservatism is certainly appreciated. But on the call, you also mentioned your mid-single-digit target near-term growth expectation. At the Analyst Meeting, you were very clear that you would expect to be there in fiscal 2014, I believe. Could you help us reconcile the conservatism in the second half and how you get back to mid-single-digit in fiscal 2014? And then I just have one follow-up for you.","Omar S. Ishrak","Well first of all, we expect to be in the high end of the range given our momentum. And then we'll see as the quarter plays out what kind of ranges are applicable for next year. But we're close enough at this point that we think that, that outlook for the midterm is still valid. I mean that's all I can add. That the tailwinds that we have will get further reinforced as we go through the -- go through next 6 months or so, we'll get a better feeling for it. I think lots of markets probably will -- with some of the uncertainties that will removed as we go through the end of the year and different policy areas will be more concrete. And we think some of our tailwinds will get firmer. That's what we're expecting. And that will take us into next year along the same lines. So Europe, [ph] we have every expectation to at least be in the high end of this range, and that'll provide us good continuity in growth as we go into next year.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful.","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes, that's all I can say.","Gary L. Ellis","Yes, I mean obviously, this is Gary. I mean we've given a 2% to 4% guidance. Obviously, we're consistent with because there are some uncertainties as we've talked about and we've highlighted. We don't want to play those up too much because the reality is we have been performing better than that, and we've been performing better than our guidance. And again, we have every expectation and our hope that we can do better than our guidance even in the back half of the year. But it's just with the uncertainties in the marketplace, we're just continuing to try to say let's not get ahead of ourselves, let's keep the 2% to 4% growth expectations out there, at least for the rest of this year. And as things firm up and we get a little bit better certainty in where some of these things are playing out, then obviously we'll determine what our guidance for FY 14 is.","Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then Omar, you talked about extending into large joints earlier on the call. Can you talk about your strategy in that area and does Kanghui give you what you need?","Omar S. Ishrak","Well, Kanghui's a starting point. I mean that's all I say. We're excited about Kanghui, but largely construction -- the large joint reconstruction is actually, at this stage, a pretty small element of what we're going to get with Kanghui. And we're more focused on the spine and trauma businesses, primarily their success in China. I mean into the orthopedics market in general, that capability will help us. But you got to remember that we've got a series of other products that do impress the orthopedics market, and we have a good sales channel into that market. So when these types of products do come along and they have -- they reach the appropriate critical mass and breadth as well as quality, we'll have an opportunity. But it's very, very early for us to either depend on it or even comment on it in too much detail. Chris, do you want to add anything to that?","Christopher J. O'Connell","I think you said it well. It's relatively early. We're new to this business as you know. Our primary focus is on China. We do have multiple product lines in large joint reconstruction for China, more of a premium line as well as more of a value line. We're just getting some of those products or Kanghui is just getting some of those products into the marketplace right now and it's going to be a learning opportunity for us starting in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.","Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to ask one on CRM and spine. Those markets continue to struggle. You've actually performed a little bit better there the last couple of quarters. But maybe that's the area that -- because you really accelerate your growth year-over-year. So you provided some comments on stability, but I was just curious if you had some more feedback on your implant volume growing versus the bulk ordering in CRM and how that could lead to better growth going forward? And then in spine, it seems like the pricing pressures kind of overarching some of the new product launches. But can you maybe talk about how we might see growth improve sequentially in the spine market for you?","Omar S. Ishrak","Well, let's take those one at a time. First of all, you're right. In CRM, the implant rates do give us line of sight to what the future will look like. And also, the reduction in these bulk end of quarter purchases will anniversary to some degree as we move forward. So the implant rate growth gives us some confidence in the future. And I'll let Mike comment on that a little bit here. But -- and on the spinal area, they too, our Core Spine business actually is showing some pretty good traction, primarily based on our new products and procedures. Remember, in these numbers we've got our Kyphon product line as well which s actually a negative drag to the overall numbers. So if you really look at the Core Spine, which is the bulk of the market, our performance is quite encouraging. And the market dynamics certainly have not changed. I mean some of the pressures related to pricing as well as peer pushback, they're still there, but haven't worsened. And we're certainly, I think, beginning to demonstrate that some of our new products and procedures are real value and now they're getting customer acceptance. I think both of these markets are important and deserve a little more color. So I'm going to ask Mike first to talk a bit about share, and then I'll ask Chris to comment on spine. So Mike [indiscernible].","Michael J. Coyle","It is encouraging to see the ICD implant rates stabilizing. We still have the pricing pressures that we've referenced, obviously looking at that 3%-ish U.S. pricing pressure that we referenced in the call, continues to be an issue for us. On the other hand, we were very encouraged to be in a position of taking market share there that's primarily been in the replacement arena. And we also obviously have seen our lead-to-port ratio increasing. We are encouraged that we're heading into a product cycle in the CRM space with obviously the [indiscernible] the CRT families in Europe, with the CE Mark in the third quarter, the EVERA product line in Q4. We showed data at the recent AHA meeting that pointed to the value of Lead Integrity Alert on identifying issues with competitive leads. That's something that will help us immediately in Europe. That's something that we'll take to U.S. FDA to attempt to get labeling. And then of course as we head into next year, we'll have the U.S. Viva\/Brava and EVERA product lines, as well the Advisa MRI product line. And then, we obviously -- and we're encouraged with the AHA data on BLOCK HF which showed the benefits of CRT pacing and patients with AV block which have potentially been standard pacer applications. This would give us a pricing opportunity in that space. So there are a number of positive trends there, and we are hoping to drive market share further. And we that we think we have the catalyst to do that, but we also want to be cautious given the pricing pressures that we've seen the market.","Omar S. Ishrak","Chris, you want to see if...","Christopher J. O'Connell","Sure. Just on spine. The pricing pressure in spine has been pretty consistent over the last number of quarters, and we're managing that through really 2 or 3 major strategies. Number one is to continue to introduce new technology. And we do get better pricing when we introduce new technology. The Solera system, for example, is really hitting on all cylinders now with critical mass, not just in the smaller rod diameters, but the larger rod diameters. We have now more than  400 sets of the 5 5 6 0 [ph]. And we have also rolled out the minimally invasive package with Solera. And when that technology comes into the market, we're able to offset some of the bigger declines in the legacy-type systems. But also, trying to bring new procedures to the market. We've talked in the past about MAST MIDLF for example, which is a mini open procedure enabling more surgeons to do less invasive procedures. And now at MAST this year, we just launched the OLIF procedure which is another example of procedural innovation that's setting us apart and also firming up our pricing. So we don't expect pricing pressure to go away, to answer your question, but we expect that we'll have more and more tools to combat that and to position Medtronic well. And as Omar said, we feel really good about the direction of our Core Spine business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I had 2 follow-ups on spine. One, some of the smaller players have reported in the last month and have commented that they're anticipating or currently seeing greater pushback from payors on the commercial side. I'm wondering if you can give us your color on what's happening on the commercial side with respect to pay or pushback, if you're seeing any. And then I had a follow-up on PODs.","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. Look, let me first comment on it and then, I'll let Chris talk to this as well. From everything we can see, the underlying dynamics have not changed. It's basically what it has been for the last 12, 24 months. And so we certainly are not seeing that. So I don't know. Chris, you're closer to this, any comments?","Christopher J. O'Connell","Yes, it's been consistent beam. It's really no worse now than it was a year ago or 6 months ago. And I think what's happening is that the overall medical system is anticipating this, is experiencing this and is finding ways to work through it. Additionally, I'm encouraged by a more concerted effort on the part of some of the medical societies in pushing for more guidelines for a range of different types of spinal procedures which are helping with the commercial payor. So I don't think we expect this trend to change one way or another. But I think we are finding ways to manage it better.","Omar S. Ishrak","And I think the healthcare systems are also finding ways to live within the constraints.","Christopher J. O'Connell","To live within the constraints to answer the questions in an efficient way and to generate the evidence from the guidelines over time that will help mitigate the issue.","Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up on PODs. While we were down at NASS, it seemed like the emergence or the growth of PODs at least was increasing a bit and that surgeons were moving towards PODs. What are your thoughts there? Are you anticipating any surgeon losses? Is PODs having any negative impact on your business?","Omar S. Ishrak","Chris?","Christopher J. O'Connell","Sure. We started seeing the effect of PODs several years ago, and it tends to follow somewhat of the regional pattern when you see these things develop. But right now, we don't believe that the PODs are gaining share. We believe they are somewhere around 10% in the market, it has been a headwind for a period of time, but it seems relatively stable. We are encouraged by some of the pushback that the PODs are getting by states as well as the federal government, the fact that the OIG is now surveying hospitals on PODs is a very encouraging step in our direction. We are very concerned about the PODs and the complex of interest that they represent. And so we have an active position against PODs. We do not participate in that business model. And it is a little bit of a way of life right now, but it is not directionally worse right now than it was say a year ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of things. I was thinking fourth quarter that we might see some color on -- initial color on the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast, but then I realized your quarter ends on the 26th. Was there much impact? And will we see some impact at all on procedures or volumes in the next quarter?","Omar S. Ishrak","Well there is obviously short-term impact because hospitals are shut down and so on. And we've had some ripple impact at the end of that. I think over time, this will recover. To the extent that they will impact Q3, we'll have to see. But it's one of the headwinds we're going to manage.","Gary L. Ellis","Rick, I mean we obviously saw something in the first couple of weeks after with some of the hospitals. But it seems to be getting back to kind of normal as we go forward. And so we don't expect it to be meaningfully too impactful here in the quarter overall. Hurricane Sandy really had no impact on our distribution capability. We were able to, with all of our offices and things, be able to manage that aspect of it. Obviously as Omar said, hospitals were shut down there for a period of time, but we saw a small impact in the first week or 2 of this quarter, but the reality is it's relatively minor.","Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And 2 other quick ones. Omar, a bunch of MedTech industry folks in Washington lobbying for a rollback of the med-tech tax. Are you hopeful at all that we could see that changed? And maybe a last -- a quick one for Chris. Chris, there's some new approvals in the cervical space, new products getting approved. Maybe any updated perspective on how that market's likely to evolve with some new and changing evolving technology?","Omar S. Ishrak","With respect to the med-tech tax, previously we've maintained our position that it's something that we would like repealed if possible. And we've worked with AdvaMed to their leadership in supporting them. However, we\u2019d really like to focus on things that we can control. Right now that's what the law is, that's what the projection is going to be. And you can assume that that's going to come into play. And therefore, we've got to build our business to deal with it. And hence, we've built our plan assuming that the medical device tax will come into play in January. We've potentially got $50 million or so that we're going to manage through the balance of the year, of the fiscal year for us. And it's like we've stated before, it's something between $125 million to $175 million a year that we've got to manage. And we're focused on building our business models to deal with it. Again, we like to focus on things that we can control, and that's why we've taken this approach. Chris, you want to...","Christopher J. O'Connell","Sure. On cervical. Thanks for asking about cervical, Rick. And yes, there have a number of new entrants in the U.S. cervical disc market. We're very, very excited about the BRYAN ACD which we've launched now. We've done more than 100 procedures, all of them competitive. We've trained more than 300 surgeons and, obviously, there are more options on the market right now. I think that's going to be good for patients because here for patients that have limited options for cervical discs in the U.S. But it's also important to note our overall cervical portfolio is really getting stronger. Cervical teams doing a great job with the ATLANTIS VISION ELITE as well as the VERTEX SELECT. So now, BRYAN ACD kind of completes the circuit for us in that important segment, and it's going to be good for the market.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Mike, my first question is to you. As you know, there is a pretty inflammatory paper published this week on the Optim coating, which suggested the potential for high mass loss 6 years out even at body temperature. I guess the question is, is what were the origins of that? Was the FDA involved in it? The decision to -- urging you to publish it, which we've heard? And I guess the final question is this, what do you think the long-term implications of that for your share position in the market?","Omar S. Ishrak","So go -- I think Mike is [indiscernible]. Go ahead, Mike.","Michael J. Coyle","Bruce, we've been studying this silicone polyurethane copolymer materials for about 10 years here at Medtronic for numerous applications in multiple businesses, both chronic-lead applications as well as more acute device uses. And the lead project for that was the SEVENTO project which is our 7 French ICD lead where we were considering using this material as the primary lead insulation material. Now, given the experiences that we had with Fidelis, we were intent on characterizing the performance of this material over the entire expected life of its use in a patient 10-plus years. And so we engaged in a very thorough analysis of the materials, looking at all of the potential mechanisms for failure that we thought could come into play. During the course of that work we determined, quite to our surprise, that there was a failure mode called hydrolysis, which basically is a chemical reaction that is occurring within the material that is causing over the useful life of the material, the molecular weight of that polymer to degrade. So we shared that information with the suppliers and found that not only had it not been reported but in fact it was, from our perspective, unknown and that this was the first time that had identified this as a potential failure mode. So both our internal advisers and we ourselves determined that it was important that this information get into the scientific literature through the peer review process so that this performance characteristic of the material could be considered by scientists and engineers of companies who are considering using this material, as well as global regulatory authorities so they would understand how this plays out in the course of the use of a device. So we chose the vehicle of the Macromolecules which is a journal which is the journal of the American Chemical Society, and that was published last week. I'm kind of surprised to hear you use the term inflammatory. Does -- anyone who's read the paper would say that this is a very thorough technical paper. I, myself, am a chemical engineer, and I found it difficult reading just in terms of the complexity of the information that was being relayed. But this was purely a technical journal that we are -- that we're putting it out, so that individuals can consider this and the evaluation of this material for use in future products.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And one more follow-up to you. In your prepared comments, if I heard it correctly, you said that U.S. Spine procedure growth was negative mid-single digits. But encouragingly, ASPs across price and mix were flat. I guess the question is, is on a strategic basis, where do you see case growth over time? And do you feel -- how long will this readjustment period last?","Omar S. Ishrak","Well first, let me just clarify. The procedures were low single digits, not mid. So that does make a little difference. But beyond that, we continue to believe that the -- and I've kind of heard this from all my visits to customers and hospitals around the U.S. and around the world that the spinal procedures, long-term, will continue to grow because of demographic reasons. Low back pain is an issue. Certainly, trauma and deformities and so on are clearly leads. But as the population ages, the back pain problems will only increase. And so we are betting, and I'm quite sure that long-term these procedures will come back. Now having said that, there is a level of certainty that as we put in the market through guidelines, better guidelines, good coordination with healthcare delivery systems as well as pairs, and we intend to work with both of them to form up these guidelines that can work in the most certain environment. And that's what's driving some of the volatility in this marketplace. And that's going to take a little time to resolve, but we are in the middle of that effort working because of our leadership position, working very closely with societies and with our customers to put these guidelines in place so that things are more stable as we go forward, and really learn about the clinical procedure in a more effective way.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So on a worldwide basis, I guess you expect this to kind of match the overall corporate profile in the midterm, is that fair to say?","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. On a global basis, yes. We're certainly seeing a significant opportunity for growth in emerging markets in this area because they're very underpenetrated. And again with the right awareness levels, the right training of physicians and again, putting in place the right guidelines, we think that the emerging markets, at some point, will reach a inflection point and will provide growth. But in the midterm, you're right. We expect this segment of our business to get close to our overall corporate profile.","Okay. All right. So with that, let's close the call here. Thank you very much for your questions. And on behalf of the entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. For those of you in the U.S. I want to wish you and your families all a very happy Thanksgiving. And we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call in February.

Thank you.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Sir?","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Maria. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast.","During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 first quarter, which ended July 31, 2015. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by division summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement presentation.","You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. In addition unless we say otherwise, all year-over-year revenue growth rates including revenue growth ranges given on today's call are adjusted for the extra selling week in the first quarter and given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien Plc in the prior year comparison aligning Covidien\u2019s prior year monthly revenue to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal quarters.","These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release. In addition all foreign currency translation calculations are done on a comparable basis.","With that, I\u2019m now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us.","This morning we reported first quarter revenues of $7.3 billion, which represents growth of 12% at the upper end of our mid single digit range after adjusting for the extra selling week in our first quarter. Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02.","Q1 was another strong quarter where our employees around the world executed and delivered results that were at the high end of our objectives. The underlying fundamentals of our business remain solid with robust contributions from all four of our groups.","CVG and diabetes were in the high single digits while RTG and MITG grew in the mid single digits after adjusting the growth rates for the extra selling week this quarter. From a geographic perspective, our performance in the U.S. was particularly strong with high single digit revenue growth again after adjusting for the extra week.","Our teams continue to execute on important product launches and our customers around the world are responding to our differentiated healthcare solutions that seek to demonstrate both clinical and economic value.","We remain focused on our three growth strategies; therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. These strategies aim to create a competitive advantage for Medtronic by* capitalizing on three long-term trends we see playing out in healthcare; namely the continued desire to improve clinical outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare and the optimization of cost and efficiency in healthcare systems, including the move to value-based healthcare.","We believe our three growth strategies are the right ones to achieve long-term growth and the resulting diversification, differentiated approach and competitive advantages will enable us to deliver on our baseline financial expectations.","We've translated each of our strategies into three independent growth vectors with clearly stated near term objectives for each one. We continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals on a regular basis.","In therapy innovation, we delivered above goal performance again in Q1. With the new therapies growth vector contributing approximately 1,020 basis points for our total company growth, including the benefit of the extra week.","But even after adjusting for the extra week, this result was well above our goal of 150 to 350 basis points of growth. We're seeing strong acceptance for our new therapies across all groups. In addition our pipeline remains full with a number of new therapies and services expected to come to market over the next few years.","In our cardiac and vascular group, the recent launches of our CoreValve transcatheter valve, IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon and Micra Transcatheter Pacing System combined with the continued growth of Reveal as well as the upcoming U.S. launch of Evera MRI ICD are all expected to drive strong growth this fiscal year.","Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group is driving growth with its differentiated Endo GIA Reinforced Reload and LigaSure Maryland Jaw and also has a full pipeline of minimally invasive innovations that are expected to launch over the coming quarters.","In Restorative Therapies, we're building momentum from new products in Neurovascular such as the Pipeline Flex device for intracranial aneurysms and Solitaire FR stent thrombectomy device.","In RTG surgical technologies division, a number of new imaging and navigation products are expected to drive growth over the coming quarters. Our Diabetes Group is realizing growth from its MiniMed 530G and 640G systems and has a number of advancements in the pipeline as we continue to drive towards an artificial pancreas.","Taken together we feel confident we can deliver sustained growth from new therapies, contributing significantly to our baseline goal of mid single digit revenue growth.","Turning to globalization, our emerging markets growth vector contributed approximately 190 basis points for our Q1 total company growth including the benefit of the extra week. After adjusting for the extra week, this result fell below our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points from the emerging market growth vector.","This was largely due to a planned delay in distributor sales in Saudi Arabia in preparation for our channel optimization move. We have a controlling interest in the newly formed joint venture with our largest distributor in Saudi Arabia.","Starting in the second quarter, this joint venture is expected to deliver incremental revenue and improved margins over our historical performance in Saudi Arabia. While the Middle East and Africa region was weaker this quarter owing to the delayed distributor sales we did see notable improvements in China, India and Russia.","Mainland China grew in the low double-digits above our estimated growth of the China medical device market. Our China results benefitted from the initial implementation of our channel optimization strategy in the region, which is focused on transitioning our distribution channel to include consolidated platform distributors.","We also saw improvements in India, which grew in the mid teens and Russia, which grew in the upper teens and over the long term, we believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in Medtech.","In addition to standard market development activities, our differentiated approach of local channel optimization, government contracts and private partnerships are all aimed at unlocking this opportunity.","Turning to economic value, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 50 basis points to our growth in Q1 on a legacy Medtronic basis or 30 basis points in an overall Medtronic basis.","While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points we intend to grow into our goal of services and solutions are adopted by the Legacy Covidien businesses.","In Cath Lab Managed Services, we're generating rapid growth as we're fast becoming the ideal partner for hospitals that seek to drive operational efficiency.","We\u2019re now expanding our Cath Lab Managed Services business globally with new accounts in Eastern Europe, Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Since the program is launched two years ago, we have completed 59 long-term agreements with hospital systems representing $1.3 billion in revenue over an average plan of six years and we have a large number of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the world.","In addition we\u2019ve now signed the first three operating room managed services deals in Europe each spanning nine years. ORMS applied the CLNS business model to an operating room setting, utilizing the breath of MITG\u2019s products and expertise.","In diabetes, Q1 was the first full quarter of operating Diabeter, a Netherlands based diabetes clinic and research center that we intend to expand across Europe. With the Diabeter and our continued strong progress with partnerships such as IBM, we continue to transform our Diabetes Group from a market leading pump and sensor company to a leading providing of holistic diabetes management solutions that we believe will expand access, integrate care and improved outcomes so that people living with diabetes can enjoy great freedom and better health.","We continue to focus on providing solutions to providers that go beyond purely medical devices including taking a leadership position in aligning our solutions to new value based payment models that are emerging in healthcare. We were pleased to see the U.S. center from Medicare & Medicaid Services proposed bundle payment initiative for hip and knee replacements.","While Medtronic does not participate in hips and knees, CMS may well broaden these bundle payment initiatives to other care pathways where we do have leadership positions. Proposals like this from CMS demonstrate that a move to value-based healthcare is underway. The proposal mandates the participating hospitals be at risk for the cost and quality of the joint replacement surgery and 90 days of post acute care.","As bundle payments take hold, we expect to offer unique comprehensive solutions to healthcare providers, encompassing our devices, associated diagnostics and home-based patient monitoring programs, all wrapped in risk sharing business models.","Next turning to our integration efforts, the integration of Covidien into Medtronic continues to go extremely well. As I've mentioned before, we've organized our activities in four clearly defined areas; preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We've been successfully achieving our first and highest priority preserve as evidenced by the continued revenue growth across all of our groups and geographies.","We continue to monitor talent retention and overall employee satisfaction both of which remained strong. Our second priority optimize, is focused on achieving the expected minimum of $850 million in cost synergies by the end of FY'18.","As planned, we've already completed over half of our value capture initiatives in the fiscal year and these savings are expected to build as we go through the year with an FY'16 goal of achieving $300 million to $350 million in savings.","We're executing in our indirect sourcing plans, where we're using best case contracts and improved purchasing power to achieve meaningful savings. We\u2019re also realizing significant real estate savings having already closed over 60 facilities most of which were redundant field offices or distribution centers.","Our third priority accelerate, is related to a disciplined process of assessing and prioritizing the numerous revenue synergy opportunities, which include leveraging the legacy Covidien's peripheral vascular sales force to drive sales of drug-coated balloons and leveraging Covidien's Neurovascular Division to enhance our Neuroscience strategy in RTG.","In accordance with our plan, we have aligned the sales forces and integrated the back offices expeditiously in both of these areas, including moving the North American commercial operations of both businesses onto Medtronic\u2019s enterprise system SAP.","Our fourth and final priority is transform. We're positioning the company to play an increasingly larger role in delivering higher value in healthcare, aligning our solutions to the emerging value-based payment markets and partnering with new stakeholders to lead and succeed in the transforming healthcare marketplace.","An early example is our operating room managed services initiative in MITG where we take over the management and operations of hospital rooms -- hospital operating rooms.","While we had a number of successes in Q1, we also faced some challenges including underperformance in our U.S. Core Spine business. Some of our recent product roll outs are taking longer to reach scale, but we\u2019re seeking to actively address our performance through a series of near, medium and longer term actions.","In the near term, we intend to sign more large system deals to provide procedural volume share by using our new integrated RTG commercial organization.","Over the medium term, we'll translate our surgical synergy initiative into a more specific commercial offering and focus the efforts of our new integrated commercial organization in promoting it. Over the longer term, we expect to see the impact of the changes we\u2019re making to our product development processes, which include incorporating several methods that have been successful in other parts of the company.","Turning to the P&L, Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02. Foreign currency translation continues to be a significant headwind affecting our Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14. On a constant currency basis, our non-GAAP diluted EPS growth represented over 400 basis points of leverage, above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points.","We delivered $1.1 billion of free cash flow in Q1 after adjusting for certain litigation payments and non-recurring tax payments. We remain disciplined in allocating our capital with a focus on creating long term shareholder value. As a result of the Covidien acquisition, we've increased ability to deploy our cash in the U.S., solidifying our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","In June, we announced a 25% increase in our dividend, a 38th consecutive year of increasing our dividend. We expect to not only grow our dividend over time with earnings growth, but to increase our dividend payout ratio to 400% on a non-GAAP basis within the next few years.","As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth. In addition, we remain disciplined in evaluating potential M&A opportunities. Any investment we must make -- any investment we make must be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies while at the same time offer high return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution.","Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our first quarter results. Gary?","Gary Ellis","Thanks Omar. First quarter revenue of $7.274 billion increased 70% as reported, 12% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for a $529 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency and including the favorable impact from the extra week or at the upper end of our mid single digit range after adjusting for the extra week.","Our first quarter results included an extra week due to our 52, 53-week fiscal year. While the exact benefit of the extra week is difficult to estimate, based on our analysis we calculate that it added approximately six percentage points of growth on the quarter or approximately 1.5 percentage points of growth for the full fiscal year.","Legacy acquisitions and divestitures from both Medtronic and Covidien contributed 30 basis points net to Q1 growth.","Q1 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1.02, an increase of 3%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.57, a decrease of 34%. In addition to the $372 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter had several GAAP to non-GAAP after-tax adjustments primarily related to the Covidien transaction.","A $165 million charge related to amortization of the remaining inventory purchase price step-up, a $53 million charge for acquisition-related items and a $52 million net restructuring charge.","Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company revenue grew in the high single digits. This was a result of strong low double digit growth in Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure and mid single digit growth in both coronary and structural heart and aortic and peripheral vascular divisions.","Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure or CRHF had strong above market low double digit growth again in Q1. We estimate the overall CRHF market continues to grow in the low to mid single digits.","The market is showing strong preference for our leading differentiated technologies, including Evera, XT, CRT-D with its AdaptivCRT algorithm and Attain Performa Quadripolar Lead, the Arctic Front Advance Cryoablation System, the Evera MRI ICD in Japan and revealed LINQ insertable cardiac monitor in the U.S. and Europe.","Strong demand for our Reveal LINQ resulted in diagnostic growth in the high 20s and is also resulting in meaningful pacemaker pull-through. In Europe, the launch of our Premium Micra Transcatheter Pacing System is off to a great start. Micra is one-tenth the size of a traditional pacemaker and is placed directly inside the heart.","Looking ahead the robust productivity of our CRHF pipeline will continue as we expect to launch the Evera MRI ICD in the U.S. imminently.","In addition the MRI safe version of Viva CRT-D in the U.S. and Europe, the full market release of the Arctic Front Advance Cryoablation System in Japan and the full market release of the third generation Arctic Front ST Cryo Balloon in Europe are all expected by the end of this fiscal year.","Coronary and Structural Heart or CSH grew in the mid single digits driven by growth in Transcatheter Heart valves, drug-eluting stents and balloons. Transcatheter heart valves grew in the low 30s globally and in the high 30s in the U.S.","In Q1 we received U.S. FDA approval for Evolut R, the first and only recashable heart valve in the U.S. and the first commercial implant started late in the quarter. Our team is focused on training U.S. Centers on this next-generation valve with its differentiated 14-French equivalent delivery catheter and we expect to be in all of our current U.S. accounts by the end of the calendar year.","In Europe Evolut R is driving strong growth helping us gain share in Western Europe and we estimate we now hold the number one TAVR position in 11 European countries.","In Japan we received PMDA approval for CoreValve and are anticipating reimbursement approval and launch in our third quarter. Last week we announced that we've entered into an agreement to acquire Twelve, a development stage company that is executing first in human clinical evaluations of a unique transcatheter mitral valve replacement design that we believe represents leadership technology in this phase and accelerates our time to market in this important new growth area.","In drug-eluting stents, we grew in the low single digits and are holding global share on the strength of Resolute Onyx in CE mark countries and Resolute integrality in the U.S. It is worth noting that we continue to grow our U.S. DES share as an increasing percentage of U.S. DES sales are included in multi-line CVG customer agreements that leverage our broad cardiology product lines, those innovative therapies and wrap around program and services.","In Q1 we also commenced enrollment in the two important clinical trials. Our first in human trial for our drug filled stent and our spiral HTN off and on med study and renal denervation.","In Aortic and Peripheral Vascular Division or APVD, revenue grew in the mid single digits with low double digit growth in peripheral vascular partially offset by low single digit declines in aortic.","In peripheral, we continue to execute a strong U.S. launch of our IN.PACT Admiral drug coated balloon and maintain our leading market position on the strength of our exceptional clinical data.","Q1 was the first full quarter of launch utilizing our combined Medtronic and legacy Covidien peripheral sales force. We expect to file for expected indications for IN.PACT Admiral with a PMAS U.S. filing in the second half of this fiscal year for in-stent restenosis indication as well as a CE mark filing by the end of this fiscal year for an AV fistula indication.","In atherectomy, we continue to see strong growth in new accounts from HawkOne Directional Atherectomy System, which has helped us stabilize share and see share gains above the knee.","Last month we started the U.S. launch of the Entrust Delivery System, which is used to place our EverFlex self-expanding peripheral stent.","In our Aortic business while we faced increased competitive pressure outside the U.S. and felt the impact of market reimbursement cuts in Japan, the business grew in the U.S. driven by the continued market adoption of our Endurant IIs Triple A stent graft, which resulted in sequential share gains.","During the quarter our aortic business announced a number of important developments in both its organic and inorganic product pipeline including first implants of our next generation Endurant AAA stent graft platform, initiation of the U.S. feasibility clinical study for the valiant LSA branch, thoracic stent graft platform, acquisition of the Aptus Endo Anchor product line and the initiation of a joint development and staged acquisition agreement with Arsenal Medical to commercialize the company's novel and aneurysmal sac billing pump technology in AAA stent grafting applications.","Now turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group where it grew in the mid single digits and accounted for 34% of the total company revenue. MITGs revenue performance was driven by high single digit growth in surgical solutions and low single digit growth in patient monitoring and recovery. The Group benefited from strength in surgical volumes in the U.S., which has been incurring now for the past three quarter.","Surgical Solutions grew in the high single digits with high single digit growth in advance surgical, low single digit growth in general surgical as well as low double digit growth in early technologies.","Advance surgical strong quarter was driven by balanced low double digit growth in both advance stapling and advanced energy, as the business benefited from new products, the continued trend of surgical procedures moving from open to minimal invasive and the underlying strength of surgical volumes in the U.S.","Early Technologies was driven by strong growth in GI solutions and interventional lung solutions. Patient monitoring recovery grew in the low single digits. Respiratory and patient monitoring, nursing care, and patient care and safety all grew in the low single digits.","Respiratory and patient monitoring growth was driven by strong U.S. patient monitoring sales. Nursing care had strong sales in internal feeding.","Now moving to our Restored Therapies Group; revenue grew in the mid single digits and accounted for 25% of total company revenue. Results were driven by mid 20s growth in neurovascular and high single digit growth in surgical technologies with low single digits growth in Spine and Neuromodulation.","Spine grew in the low single digits in line with the global market. However, in the U.S. our core spine business underperformed the market. We recently realigned our RTG commercial sales management and we expect these changes to result in better alignment of incentives and an improved focus on cross-selling in our surgical synergy program, which integrates our spine implants and surgical technologies imaging and navigation equipment.","We also expect the core spine business to improve as its numerous recent and upcoming product launches reach scale, including our alleviate expendable cage and Solera Voyager System in thoracolumbar as well as our Divergence Stand-Alone Interbody Cage the ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System, the PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and the ANATOMIC PTC interbody spacer in cervical.","In neuromodulation, revenue increased in the low single digits driven by mid single digit growth in Gastro\/Uro and DBS and low single digit growth in Pain stim.","Our U.S. Pain stim business grew in the mid single digits, in line with the market. In pumps for Pain stim spasticity we have implemented the required changes to the distribution processes and are executing against our commitments under the consent decree we received in late April.","Following an initial decline in Synchromed II implants, we saw stabilization in the back half of the quarter.","In Surgical Technologies, revenue grew in the high single digits driven by mid teens growth in advanced energy, high single digit growth in Neurosurgery and mid single digit growth in ENT. Surgical technologies continues to benefit from diversified growth coming from disposals, service revenue and the strong adoption of new products including the StraightShot M5 Microdebrider and NuVent sinus balloon.","Our Neurovascular Division posted strong revenue growth in the mid 20s. New products such as our Pipeline Flex device for the treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms and SOLITAIRE FR 4\/40 revascularization device for stent thrombectomy are driving solid double-digit growth in Flow Diversion and Stents.","We're also seeing increased pull through of our neurovascular access products given the strength of pipeline and SOLITAIRE. Earlier this week, we acquired Medina Medical and its Aneurysm abolition mesh technology for hemorrhagic stroke, which we believe can disrupt the Twelve market.","Now moving to our Diabetes Group, revenues grew in the high single digits and accounted for 6% of total company sales. Low double digit growth and Intensive Insulin Management Division was driven by continued strong adoption in the U.S. of the MiniMed 530G insulin pump system was the Enlite CGM sensor.","Growth was also driven by the continued international launch of the next generation MiniMed 640G insulin pump system with enhanced Enlite CGM sensor. We continue to make progress of bringing this technology to the U.S. and plan to submit the PMA for this system to the FDA later this calendar year.","In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapy Division, revenue growth in the high 60s was driven by sales of professional CGM and infusion ports for type 2 diabetes and our diabetes services. In our Diabetes Services and Solutions division, high single digit growth was driven by strong consumable sales in the U.S.","Our Diabetes Group announced several new partnerships in the quarter including Samsung, Becton Dickinson and Gluco. We also received the FDA approval in Q1 for the MiniMed Connect, which allows users to view their insulin pump and CGM data on a smartphone and provides remote monitoring and text message notifications for their care givers. This product is expected to launch in the second quarter.","Turning to rest of the income statement, after adjusting for certain non-GAAP items mentioned earlier, the Q1 operating margin was 27.2%, which included 110 basis point negative impact from foreign currency. On a comparable constant currency basis, this represents a 40 basis point improvement in operating margins versus the prior year.","Reflecting a relatively stabled gross margin a 110 basis point improvement in SG&A expense as a percent of sales and a negative 60 basis point change in net other expense due to onetime items all on a comparable constant currency basis.","Included in the Q1 operating margin were non-GAAP gross margin SG&A as a percent of sales and R&D as a percent of sales of 69.3%, 33.7% and 7.7% respectively. It is worth noting that the non-GAAP gross margin SG&A and R&D were negatively affected by 130 basis points, 30 basis points and 40 basis points from foreign currency respectively.","Also included in the operating margin was net other expense of $61 million including net gains from our hedging program of $64 million. We hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce the volatility and our earnings from foreign exchange.","In addition a growing portion of our profits are un-hedged especially emerging markets currencies, which can create some modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming current exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which includes $1.12 Euro and 1.22 Yen, we expect the FY'16 net other expense to be in the range of $185 million to $235 million, which includes an expected impact from the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $210 million.","For Q2 FY'16, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million based on the previously mentioned exchange rates. Overall, we continue to expect the full year FY'16 operating margin to be in the range of 28% to 29% on an as reported basis, which includes over 100 basis of margin improvement on a comparable constant currency basis offset by a similar amount of negative FX impact.","This results in approximately 400 basis points of operating leverage on a comparable constant currency basis related to the cost synergies, which are the majority which are now expected in SG&A as a result of the Covidien acquisition as well as the continued execution on the legacy leverage initiatives of both Covidien and Medtronic.","We continue to expect operating margins in the first half of the year to be below the full-year range improving in the back half of the year as the foreign exchange headwinds lessen and cost synergies accelerate.","Below the operating profit line, Q1 net interest expense was $191 million a significant increase from the prior year comparable quarter, but consistent with Q4 FY'15 as we are including the incremental interest expense from our December 2014 $17 million bond offerings.","At the end of Q1, we had approximately $18 billion in cash and investments and $35.6 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q2 net interest expense to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million.","Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q1 was 18.1%. On a full-year basis, we continue to expect our FY'16 non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 18% and we expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated.","In Q1 free cash flow was $592 million, which includes $92 million of certain litigation payments as well as $407 million of non-recurring tax payments that primarily relate to an IRS settlement.","We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow, excluding one-time items to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. In Q1, we repurchased $750 million of our ordinary shares and paid $538 million in dividends. As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 100 million shares.","First quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.436 billion shares. For FY'16, we continue to expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 1.433 billion to 1.437 billion shares including approximately 1.433 billion shares in Q2.","Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We continue to believe that full-year revenue growth in the range of 4% to 6% on a comparable constant currency basis plus the incremental approximate 150 basis point benefit from our Q1 extra selling week remains reasonable.","This operational revenue growth expectation is consistent with our stated baseline financial goal of consistently delivering mid single digit revenue growth. Our revenue outlook assumes CVG, MITG, and RTG grow in the mid-single digits and diabetes grows in the upper-single to low-double digit range all on a comparable constant currency basis and including the benefit of the extra week.","While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to the beginning of this week for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY'16 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion, including a negative $425 million to $475 million impact in Q2.","Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect cash earnings per share in the range of $4.30 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.40 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition.","As you think about your FY'16 models and quarterly gating, it is worth noting again that a higher percentage of the negative FX impact is in the first half of the year while more of the value capture synergies to occur later in the fiscal year.","While we don\u2019t give quarterly earnings per share guidance I would note that Q1 and Q2 are often similar, but this year Q1 profitability was favorably affected from the extra week and thus we would expect street models to adjust Q2 down a few pennies from Q1. As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year.","I would now turn it back over to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, I\u2019d like to briefly conclude by reiterating that Q1 was a strong quarter and we feel good about the remainder of the fiscal year. We remain focused on reliably delivering in our baseline financial model.","Mid single digit constant currency revenue growth, EPS growth of 200 to 400 basis points faster than revenue on a constant currency basis and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.","As the world continues to move towards value based healthcare, Medtronic is well positioned to provide medical technology solutions that improve outcomes while lowering cost. In fact using biomedical engineering to improve outcomes is the essence of the Medtronic mission that our Founder Earl Bakken drafted 55 years ago.","To alleviate pain, restore health and extend life, this is something I am extremely passionate about and dedicate to. As our more than 85,000 employees, we're confident that our three growth strategies, therapy and innovation, globalization and economic value are the appropriate strategies to achieve our mission.","The focus on these strategies is expected to result in both revenue diversification and sustained revenue growth. We expect to further leverage this revenue growth with our productivity initiatives, which have been significantly improved by our transmissional acquisition of Covidien.","We expect to deliver consistent and reliable results, which when combined with our solid underlying fundamentals, strong secular growth drivers and disciplined capital allocation will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare.","With that, we'll now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, Geoff Martha, who recently replaced Chris O'Connell as the President of our Restorative Therapies Group is here. Geoff is a proven leader who has had responsibility for developing Medtronic's growth strategies, executing the Covedian transaction and overseeing the integration and I am confident in his ability to leverage the opportunities within RTG.","Also joining us today to answer your questions is Mike Coyle, President of Cardiac & Vascular Group, Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group and also given the growing importance of our Cath Lab Managed Services Business, Rob Ten Hoedt. EVP and President, Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region is also present.","We are rarely able to get to everyone's questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and one follow up. If you have additional questions please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","Operator, first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Hi, good morning. Just had a quick question for Omar, then one for Gary, Omar just your business momentum has been very, very strong and that continued obviously in this quarter and you've always talked about 4% to 6%, I guess on a go-forward basis, what's now providing as you look about the product portfolio.","What gives you that confidence in that 4% to 6% and what has to go right to continue deliver on the upper end of that range over the next several quarters given some of your larger products are beginning to anniversary or the costs are getting more challenging?","Omar Ishrak","Well no, we think that we have got a pipeline of new products coming out that will replace the products that are lapping in growth and besides some of them have continued momentum even after the anniversary period like the transcatheter valve where the market continues to grow.","But as I pointed out in almost every group, we have a very strong pipeline of products coming out all the way from diabetes team to RTG minimally invasive CVG all of them have several new products in the pipeline. So we see this new therapies momentum continuing.","And in addition I am looking to supplement that with significant growth from both emerging markets as well as services and solutions, which kind of diversify our sources of revenue and can contain any surprises that may come up and so we think that that range is a pretty reliable range and after the acquisition of Covedian it's given us even more diversification.","David Lewis","Okay. So the upper end of the range Omar is not necessarily out of contention here even over the next several quarters?","Omar Ishrak","Well I would say the whole range, but you're right. The momentum right now suggests that the upper end of the range is the place to go, but the range is there for a reason and so it's -- we're going to stick to the mid single digit range and we'll do everything we can to get to the upper end of the range.","And given our momentum especially with new therapies and given the fact that in both services and solutions and emerging markets we expect our momentum to actually pick up in the back half of the year.","There is a good possibility we could drive the higher end, but the ranges like I said is there for a reason.","David Lewis","Okay. Omar, very clear. Thank you. And then Gary just one comment on the quarter, obviously revenue momentum is very strong. You had the extra selling week, I think there some are saying and in this particular quarter with the extra selling week there could have been more leverage to the bottom line. Gross margins were fine.","There was some -- it looks like some discretionary spending obviously some currency, can you just give us a sense of why we wouldn't have seen more upside in the first quarter and how we're tracking versus some of the Covedian synergies.","We talked about the $850 million number. I think there is an expectation that number could have upside. So this quarter relative to the extra selling week will obviously not have more leverage and how you're feeling about potential upside to the Covedian synergy number as we progress through the balance of the year, thank you?","Gary Ellis","Yes David, I think you addressed kind of why we -- you didn't see quite as much of it hitting the bottom line here in Q1. Obviously we saw very strong growth both at the topline and we feel good about where we ended up on the bottom line, but there is obviously a lot of headwind.","The majority of the biggest one being obviously the foreign exchange as we've highlighted foreign exchange especially in Q1, but Q1 and Q2 is probably at the peak here in these next couple of quarter and we clearly saw that in Q1 and we think that will probably become little bit less as we go through the year.","In addition, the synergies are occurring basically and exactly as we expected and back to you point we're probably a little bit ahead of schedule and achieving the overall synergies that we've laid out, but we always knew that a majority of those were going to be backend loaded in the quarter here, excuse me, in the year because it just takes time for the physicians to be consolidating or having pulled together two different companies.","There is lot of investments being made as we do that and so we knew that the synergies we have no expectation that we won't meet or exceed the $850 million that we've laid out as an organization. We're well on our way towards that schedule, but we knew from a timing perspective that that's a little bit higher, more in the backend of the year as you would expect and so we weren\u2019t going to get much benefit here obviously in Q1 to offset some of the foreign exchange issues.","So in our view, yes, you might have expected a little bit more to the bottom line especially on the strength of the revenue growth, but there is a lot of moving parts that we're still dealing with here as we pull these two companies together and everything is on schedule, everything is going as we would expect, but the timing is also as we expected and we expected it to be a little bit less in few months and improving as we go through the fiscal year.","David Lewis","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Thank you, guys and congratulations again on the quarter. Let me focus again on a couple of businesses. One I wanted to touch on was neurovascular, which you said grew mid 20s and obviously has accelerated on the back of the stroke trials that came out over the past year.","Can you just talk about how you see that market for stroke developing and the implications for sustainability of the recent performance? And then second, if you can give us any more insight into the upside performance within CRM, how much of that came from Reveal, which has obviously been a very big driver, Reveal LINQ, which has obviously been a big driver last few quarters versus kind of the underlying base CRM business, the ICD market, the pacemaker market.","Omar Ishrak","I am going to give you a little overview and then I'll ask Geoff and Mike to help out with more detail here, I think Mike from a overall perspective the stroke market is one of our biggest opportunities and we're very excited about it.","We think we're in the early stages of penetration with our new therapies and so we expect the momentum just from the therapy itself to continue. But looking into the future, we're looking at the entire stroke care pathway more carefully and we've got other products that are also impacting the stroke disease area, which we expect will have some level of pull through from our business in the stroke market.","But beyond that I think both Geoff and Mike can add more color to that and certainly Mike can add their color to the CRM question. So Geoff will you start.","Geoff Martha","Yes sure, we're seeing a lot of the growth in the last quarter come from the ischemic stroke market here and thrombectomy and we see that market continuing to grow worldwide in the 25% to 30% range and in the U.S. even a little higher than that.","And obviously the growth that's coming now in the stroke intervention piece here is from the clinical evidence that\u2019s come out recently and we see a number of barriers though and that\u2019s driving a lot of growth and there are number of barriers though that we're working on that I\u2019d like to comment on.","One is the diagnostic space and I\u2019m going to let Mike comment on that because there is a play there for our diagnostic in this area, but then there is others like the ER physician education, EMS routing, some focus on neurologists and these are areas that in addition to the intervention, we\u2019re focused on all of those areas with our team at Irvine.","And so we\u2019re feeling very good about it. You saw the in the Hemorrhagic space that\u2019s all ischemic. You saw we did this Medina acquisition, which is around mesh coils, which should help us in the Hemorrhagic space, but we're not leading right now and we think this will help us in a big way there as well. So we feel very bullish about it.","Just based on the clinical data, but there is a lot of other levers that we're working on like I mentioned and may be Mike if you want to comment on the diagnostic piece. Yes and broadly Mike your reviews on stroke and then go on to the CRM question.","Mike Coyle","Sure, I think, you asked that CRM growth and one of the drivers is certainly linked in stroke in cryptogenic stroke. In fact, the size of the revenue contribution of Link just in the cryptogenic stroke indication is very similar to the size of the solitaire contribution in the stent thrombectomy area.","So -- and we\u2019re the only company that has a complete, now profile of both diagnostic and therapeutic devices to treat ischemic stroke. So we view this as one of the largest opportunities within the company.","Broadly speaking on Cardiac rhythm in general, we have modestly better market conditions and we're taking share in virtually all of the segments that we participate in. So firstly obviously link has now fully anniversaried its introduction, which occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. So it's encouraging to see that continued growth momentum in syncope as well as atrial fibrillation monitoring and so it continues to be a strong driver.","In addition especially in the syncope, which is more than half of the uses of the product we get pacemaker pull-through from that. Roughly 8% to 9% of those patients will wind up having a pacing indication in the first year. The results of the pacemaker and over the three year life of the device we typically would expect to see that 20% of those patients becoming indicator for pacemakers which is driving new obviously market growth for us and we\u2019re capturing virtually all of that share of new pacemakers.","In the ICD market, that we\u2019ve seen modestly improved conditions, mid single digit growth in initial implants, which is very encouraging, which obviously we're benefiting from, but also from share obviously from the attained performer of product line in CRT-D segment as well as the MRI safe Evera product line in Japan where we're seeing some nice growth.","And then of course in the AF Segment, we continue to grow well above the market with our collaboration technologies really becoming the preferred intervention for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation. So all of those are driving growth for us including things like Thyrex in any effective count. So those items are all contributing to improvements in the market conditions and improvement in our share position.","Mike Weinstein","Can I ask one quick follow up for Omar or Gary, if I think about the time period since the Covidien acquisition, you've made a number of small call it technology pipeline acquisition? I think I can count 8 to 10 to sum top of my head.","Can you just talk about the cumulative dilution from all these really small acquisitions have been -- Twelve is not that small, but Medina and RF Surgical and all these other ones, what\u2019s the incremental dilution from that, that you're absorbing in your FY'16 guidance? Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Well, first of all the way we look at this is that the business units themselves make product tradeoffs. In several of them we kind of cancel existing program to cover for that. So the first responsibility to cover the dilution actually goes right down to business units and there, there is a real savings.","And then as we go up we cover in the group and then we cover at a corporate level and through that we can cover the whole dilution. The actual amount I don\u2019t know Gary, do you have sense of how much that is.","Gary Ellis","No, Mike as far as -- we\u2019re having to add it up myself to say what is it recovering because back to Omar's point most of this is being either covered by the business unit or the group as they go forward with this.","There are several of the small technology acquisitions that you mentioned whether it\u2019s actually existing revenue etcetera that there is almost no dilution and it will be neutral and it\u2019s highly positive. Some of them are more technology based that are going to have more of an impact from the standpoint of more clinical trials like Twelve for example on the transcatheter mitral.","That will have more of a dilution impact, but yes that will be basically Mike and his team will view them as an R&D program and they\u2019ll cover that in their R&D basically budget as they move forward.","So I haven\u2019t even added it up myself as far as it is actually us being focused on this discipline and if we do these types of acquisitions, we got to cover that, if is dilutive to the company, which some of them will be that we got to make trade-offs within the rest of the organization. So I don\u2019t have to tell you what the exact number is.","Mike Weinstein","Understood. Thank you, guys.","Gary Ellis","Thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I want to maybe to start with spine given the Management change that occurred over the course of the quarter and maybe Omar and team if you go in just a bit little bit more detail in helping us understand the progression to turning that business around and what specific factors will influence an acceleration of that business and when you think we can get back to sort of a market growth type in the core franchise?","Omar Ishrak","I\u2019ll let Geoff add depth to the answers here. Look, my expectation is that getting back to the core growth can\u2019t be soon enough. So we want to get there as quickly as possible and I think we\u2019re taking aggressive action especially in the near term to do with the way in which we\u2019re leveraging our integrated sales force with our products and the way we\u2019re kind of grouping these products together much more aggressively than before to make a difference in these accounts.","In the mid-term, we will drive more technological synergy through surgical synergy and we\u2019ve got sales force positioned for that and longer term we\u2019re addressing some of the speed to market issues in our product development area, which we see are existing right now. They take a little time to come through the products. So, Geoff please add to that.","Geoff Martha","Yes sure. Sure David first two macro comments, one losing being a shared donor in Core Spine in the U.S. is not acceptable to us and we have a real sense of urgency around turning that around. So that\u2019s number one and the team is committed to that.","Number two, we\u2019re making some tangible changes in the Restorative Therapies Group and the biggest one I would say is managing it as an integrated group versus a holding company with a series of business units underneath.","And when you do that this allows us to leverage our breadth to differentiate and drive growth in very targeted areas, which I\u2019ll get to in a second, but the biggest beneficiary of this change, I believe will be our spine business globally in the U.S. especially.","So some of the changes, some of the specific impacts were one, we've moved to an integrated sales force in the U.S. and in Europe and that is enabling us to do some much more efficient health system wide selling. In our case, we can combine some capital equipment from our Surgical Technologies business, navigation and imaging in with our spine products and so that\u2019s helping a lot.","And then more specifically enables us to drive this surgical synergy concept and this is where navigated procedures in spine using NAV, using our imaging and driving that to more of a standard of care.","So there are several components of that and again spine will benefit from this. A tighter technology integration between our NAV and imaging technology with our spine implants and instruments and an R&D roadmap based off as surgical synergy offering versus just an R&D roadmap is independent spine and independent Surgical Technologies.","We can get to one rep in the cases versus having a ST rep in there and a spine rep. We\u2019re developing and putting together more robust clinical and economic data and just really trying to drive the surgical synergy strategy as a standard of care and today we estimate only 14% of Core Spine procedures are navigated.","So we see a lot of upsides here and a lot of it is driven by working much closer together with our spine and our Surgical Technologies business. And then finally, we've got just a laser focus on just improving our innovation cycles in spine. The speed and the impact, and I don't want to pull any punches, we're not as fast as we need to be and that's another contributor to some of these other players gaining share on us.","And this is something that we're focused on at the spine level, at the RTG level and also pulling in some broader Medtronic resources to improve the speed and effectiveness of our innovation cycles in spine.","So we feel like we've got a lot of levers to pull here and we're focused on it. And over the -- so I just laid out some short, medium and longer term. I think the innovation cycles you won't feel that for a couple of quarters. But the other stuff, the other initiatives, the integrated selling and surgical synergy you should feel in the more near, medium term.","David Roman","That's good perspective, Geoff. Thank you. And then maybe just following up on that, Omar or Gary, anybody could talk about some of the parallels that may exist between this selling model and what you've been able to realize on the cardiology side of the business.","Because I think in your prepared remarks you talked about an increased number of stents for examples being on broader product line contract sales and if you look at your performance of those businesses clearly you're benefiting from the breadth of product lines that you have to offer?","Are there any parallels that you could draw between that experience and the spine\/imaging navigation side of the business that may give us more confidence in sort of the success of the strategy on the spine side of the business?","Omar Ishrak","Yes, look, I think you described it very well. That's exactly it. I think our near term strategies are exactly what you described that we've learned from our CVG experience that putting an integrated sales force together with a complete suite of products with specialists in the field can drive and some aggressive contracting based on that can drive pretty quick growth in sales and capture good accounts.","We really haven't done that in spine, because the sales forces have never really been put together. That mean informal context, as that\u2019s on the same as organizationally being integrated. And I think that's one of the things that we have done in the last 3 to 4 months and we're absolutely going to leverage as we go forward. And so the CVG parallel is a good one.","Geoff Martha","This is Geoff, just to build on that. I mean, not ashamed to say that we're definitely looking at the playbook that Mike Coyle and the CVG team have followed over the last four plus years and we definitely are getting a lot of confidence and inspiration from that.","And then don't overlook MITG either, because they've done a lot of this over the last couple of years as they compete against a J&J. And so I think we have two parallels to look at that aren't exactly the same, but we're drawing lessons from both of those and have already taken steps.","And then finally one advantage we have that even CVG, no offense, Mike, doesn't have - is we have real technology integration between the navigation and imaging and the power tools and the implant.","So there's real technology integration there to drive procedural innovation that not only gets at economic outcomes, procedures more efficiently and faster, but also clinical outcomes.","We need to do a better job of developing that data and getting it out there, because once surgeons try this, they really like it. There's a lot of surgeons and particularly in spine that are more experienced and sometimes they say hey, look, I don't need this. But once they try it typically they don't want to go back to do an un-navigated.","So we feel very good about that and we just have to really focus on this more over the next couple quarters.","David Roman","Okay. Great.","Geoff Martha","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Hopkins of Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Thanks. And good morning. So wanted to start out first with Omar. I was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on your comments on emerging markets since it's so topical.","And so I guess my question is just specifically what was the growth in emerging markets for Medtronic and was Middle East and Africa the only area where you saw a slowdown and then I was just wondering if you could just comment generally on your confidence in the near and intermediate term that emerging market growth can continue?","Omar Ishrak","Well, first, I'm very confident. And in fact, the Middle East and Africa was really the only region which was significantly impacted because of the reasons that I stated, because of the distributor sales. The underlying operational performance was fine and we expect that to bounce back this very quarter.","I think Latin America was a little softer than we'd like. But the other regions were much stronger than they've been historically and in particular I know that's in everyone's mind here, we were actually quite pleased with what we saw in China. We had low double-digit growth in China, which actually is better than what we've been seeing in most quarters last year.","We feel that we've outperformed the overall market. All of - the med device market there was reasonably strong. We did outperform it, but the underlying market was quite robust.","We feel at this stage with what we know and what we can - intelligence that we can get from our own people and the market itself, we feel pretty good that we can continue this and in fact accelerate it in the back half. Because we'll get some tailwind out of the Middle East and China seems to be okay, at least from what we can see.","Latin America may be a little more pressured, but China seems strong. India is definitely coming back. Russia is definitely strong. Southeast Asia is also well into the teens in growth.","And so we've got every reason to believe that with our diversified position right now we have a right to expect sort of double-digit type growth out of emerging markets and I haven't given up like I said earlier on the objective of high double-digits because I think that's what we're entitled to. We've just got to find a way to unlock it.","Robert Hopkins","Great. That's very helpful. And then for my second question, I think I heard mention that Bryan was on the line and so I wanted to ask a question about Covidien's businesses both this quarter and how they've been trending, just especially on the kind of the core general surgery markets of energy and stapling?","Just some thoughts on how is the legacy Covidien business doing and specifically energy and stapling in the quarter and recent trends?","Bryan Hanson","Hey, Bob. It's good to hear from you. Yeah, so far, so good, right. We've been able to stay focused on the business. We've been able to continue to perform as part of Medtronic as we have in the past. I feel really good about the new products that we've launched.","Omar mentioned a couple, but we have a whole family of products in advanced stapling and advanced energy, they are doing quite well for us. And of course as you know, Bob, we're not going to sit and wait for those to continue. We've got others coming behind them.","So I see the momentum in surgery in particular in the US elevating just because you see more surgical procedures, but I also see that shift from open procedures to MIS and that's creating momentum not just for us, but really for all players in the surgical marketplace.","So a good market that we're in. We've not lost our focus which is key and we continue to deliver technologies that our patients and customers need.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Good to hear. Thanks, Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Yes.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Bob. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I guess just as a -- I guess to follow up on Bob's question. I was just wondering kind of for Omar and then also for Bryan just kind of under the new kind of Medtronic umbrella has there been any change of thinking for the Covidien Group now on the idea of robotics and the importance of robotics, especially now that J&J has announced that they are teaming up with Google to have a platform.","And I don't know whether or not being under the Medtronic umbrella has changed kind of thoughts in that realm and then I have a second follow-up?","Omar Ishrak","I think -- okay. First of all, just a few words and I'll let Bryan make the brunt of the commentary on this one. First, from an overall Medtronic perspective, look, the importance of robotics is pretty clear. And it's a trend that we can drive in an application focused way and I feel confident that our team can address that market.","I think from an overall change perspective, I think a focus on some longer term investments is probably the biggest single change that I hear from Covidien, ex-Covidien employees. But I think Bryan is best suited to give more color to that, as well as the robotics strategies. Go ahead, Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","There's been a number of changes if I think about just broadly how we think about our strategy. But specifically to robotics we're continuing down the path that we were on previous to the acquisition and we're going to continue that path as part of Medtronic.","And you spoke a little about some competitors out there that are focusing in the areas as well. I actually like to see that because we are making significant investments in this area, it gives me confidence that robotics is here to stay, the embodiment of what's that going to look like, and how it\u2019s going to get traction, you know, still a question mark in my mind. But I do feel like it's here to stay.","The way I look at it from a strategic standpoint is we as an organization are highly focused on optimizing surgical procedures around the world and I kind of look at it a as three legs of a stool from a surgical perspective.","One is open surgical procedures because there's a whole heck of a lot of procedures that are still done open and they're done inefficiently. And we have advanced energy and stapling products that help the efficiency of those procedures and we're going to continue to invest there.","The other leg of the stool is what I would define as traditional MIS. This is an area that I think we've done quite well and have shown our ability to lead the market and we're going to continue to invest from a therapy innovation standpoint on that leg of the stool. And we have been making significant investments in robotics and that will continue.","Looking forward to the day that we actually enter the market with robotics and we're driving revenue and not just investment, but that will come. But to me, all three legs of the stool need to be in play for someone to be sustainably successful in the marketplace.","In addition of to that, you've heard a little bit of talk about it today, that we would overlay our capabilities from a service perspective and bring OR managed services to the table, so that we can further optimize the efficiency of the operating room.","And to me the combination of those three things I referenced from a therapy standpoint with services really will differentiate us in the space. But robotics is a piece of the puzzle, I guess is what I am saying, its not the whole puzzle.","Kristen Stewart","Got you. And then my follow up question was just more broadly, Omar, for you. Now that you've had Covidien under your belt for I guess now about eight full months. How are you thinking just about all the businesses?","And I guess as you look more holistically too at the Medtronic portfolio, do you think at this stage you have come to any conclusions or do you think you're close to coming to any conclusions that there's some businesses that maybe don't or no longer fit in the portfolio that we could see some divestitures or do you think that all the pieces still make sense?","Omar Ishrak","First, from an overall perspective, I think you understand the way in which we organized into the four groups. So that's our kind of primary strategic alignment. The goals and objectives of each of those groups are clear, into which sorts of market spaces they participate in.","And within MIPG we're still looking through that portfolio. I know there was some questions around some of those businesses. I think right now we're still looking to see a number of things.","First of all, do they add to our overall strategy of MITG and we're going through that carefully. We're not prepared to conclude on it completely. But right now they're all contributing.","Do they fulfill our mission and are inline with our missions? They are. So right now, we've got what we've got and we're driving to see if we can get growth from all of them.","I think it's a little premature to decide, although I I know it's been six or eight months. But we made some changes in the way in which we invest and to see if that investment change will result in or what they will result in, I think we need a little longer to assess.","So I'd say Kristen that we're still - at this stage we've got everything there. It all fits from a clinical relevance perspective, from a mission perspective. Whether we can - in our new paradigm of investment of some of those businesses can we change the equation more, we'll have to see.","So it's a little bit works in progress still. But by and large we're treating them like they should be in that they're completely part of MITG. Bryan you want to add anything to that.","Bryan Hanson","Well said. I mean, we're working through our own strategy and again some mindset shifts associated with our own strategy and we haven\u2019t worked through that yet. As we do we'll get a better feel for the fit of these - of all aspects of what was legacy Covidien and make decisions based on that.","One thing too, and not just from the perspective of MITG, but if you look at the broader hospital solutions opportunity and the services that we bring to bear we also have to look through that paradigm to make sure that the products that we have if they don't fit the MITG strategy still might fit the overall hospital solutions strategy. So lots to still work through, but clearly we're looking at it.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Great.","Ryan Weispfenning","We probably have time for one more question. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Joanne Wuench of BMO Capital Markets.","Joanne Wuench","Can you hear me?","Omar Ishrak","Yes, we can Joanne.","Joanne Wuench","Oh! Terrific. Thank you so much. One of the things that struck us during this earnings season was the commentary from a number of companies regarding hospital surgical volume.","If we take a big picture or big step back, big picture, what do you see going on in terms of that in the United States and how do you see that in the coming months and quarters?","Omar Ishrak","Well, you know, again, I'll let Bryan, maybe Mike also can comment on that a little bit, because I've got two of the bigger businesses here. But clearly the US is strong and procedure growth is strong. We -- on both the MITG and CVG we've taken share, but I think we'll all acknowledge that the procedure growth is really strong.","And we think that the revitalized economy, as well as the Affordable Care Act are both contributing to that depending on the nature of the procedure. We think it's too early to tell, but we think there's some sustainability to this. But I think maybe Bryan your perspective first and I'll let Mike Coyle comment also for a little bit. So Bryan, go ahead.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, again, I don't know that I have a whole lot to add to what you said. But it's clear to us, and we've got folks that are the in the operating room in the US every day, and the best litmus test for me on whether or not surgical procedures are up or when these guys go in the morning, look at the boards and see the number of procedures either during the week and on the weekends.","And we're definitely seeing a heightened number of surgical procedures from every company that I've seen present - everyone's seeing that momentum in their organization.","I would expect it to continue, though we've had it now three quarters. The question for me will be when it annualizes what does it look like at that point, but it is contributing so far for us and driving our mid single digit growth and I would expect it to continue.","Geoff Martha","Mike, you've also seen some good growth in the cardiac space\u2026","Mike Coyle","Right.","Geoff Martha","So go ahead, why don't you make some comments\u2026","Mike Coyle","Sure. I would echo that certainly in the pacemaker and ICD arena, we've seen the improvement come in initial implants which is very encouraging. And from my perspective, we're seeing sort of mid single digit growth in initial implants in ICDs in particular, which is quite a change from what we've seen in recent years.","And just anecdotally talking to customer accounts about this, they do seem to think that the availability of insurance for people who absolutely need it because they have a sickness and they can't be turned down for coverage is helping drive those volumes.","Joanne Wuench","That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, when the Covidien agreement was announced last year, one of the ideas was to cross sell what we call the buffet table of products as you went into the hospital administrator.","Given that its early days, what kind of feedback are you receiving when you go into say hey, we've got - I think quote was six of the top 10 areas really well covered now by products? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","First, we - you might have said that on day one, I'm not sure, but certainly as we laid out our strategies that was not one of our core strategies. It was more around value creation because we had Covidien products which created value within the hospital and with our Medtronic products which were like chronic disease products.","And we said that in value based healthcare, we have a broader set of assets that we could use to participate in value based healthcare model, where a broader continuum of products helps. So that was our primary notion around the breadth that we had.","The fact that we have more - that we're more significant partner to a hospital, I think is important, but that alone is not one of our key strategies. I think that gets us in the door, but each of our product lines have to perform, perform competitively with the physicians and against our competition. And then if you do have a seat at the table which others don't then we go and leverage that.","But that's not our primary integration point with Covidien. I mean, there are others like periferovascular* and neurovascular which are much more directed revenue synergy efforts where we're seeing very good results. And then in the operating room managed services we're - this aspect of moving towards value based healthcare is again where we're seeing real benefit.","I think those are the ways in which we can make a true differentiated impact in healthcare. I think the fact that we are just broader helps, but that's not a critical growth driver for us on its own.","Gary Ellis","Kristen [ph] This is Gary. Just to add to what Omar said. I mean, I think as he indicated, the idea to say there's a lot more contracted -- of the entire portfolio, no, that hasn't happened nor did we necessarily expect that was going to be the case.","But it clearly has helped us get into as we know with governments or CEOs and hospital systems, it's clearly helped us as we deal with insurance companies et cetera that we have the broader portfolio, so we're talking about a lot of different options.","But could we point to a bunch of contracts where we negotiated across the product portfolio, the answer is no. And we didn't expect that. What we did expect however, was just the strength of the portfolio will clearly get us in conversations with high level officials across organizations and much better format.","And I think that is happening and you're seeing that on some of the hospital solutions. You now see we have our first hospital solutions in the operating room with basically the former Covidien product line.","So we're seeing that all happening and back to Omar's point we're seeing the synergies across the individual product portfolio, but not from the standpoint of we're all contract bundling perspective.","Joanne Wuench","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Gary Ellis","Okay. Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay Thanks to all of you for your questions and with that and on behalf of our entire management team I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q2 call which we currently anticipate holding on December 3rd. Thank you all and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic Fourth Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to hand the program over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead.","Jeff Warren","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's Fourth Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012, which ended April 27, 2012. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue-by-business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investor portion of our website at medtronic.com.","Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly or annual results, increasing or decreasing, are in comparison to the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal year 2011, respectively, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant-currency basis. And with that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar S. Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff. And thank you to everyone joining us today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.3 billion, which represents growth of 4%, with balanced contributions from both our CVG and RTG groups. Q4 non-GAAP earnings of $1,036,000,000 and diluted earnings per share of $0.99 increased 7% and 10%, respectively. Before commenting specifically on our Q4 performance, I would like to recap fiscal year 2012, my first as CEO of Medtronic. Overall, we made progress this year in positioning the company to succeed in the changing healthcare environment. Our constant currency growth improved modestly from 1% in FY '11 to 3% in FY '12. 3\/4 of our business posted strong performances, growing a combined 8%. The remainder, consisting of our U.S. ICD and U.S. Spine businesses, declined 10%. While both of these businesses had unique factors affecting their performance, both were showing some signs of stabilization as we exited the year.","Looking down the P&L, we grew our operating margins faster than revenue by obtaining some SG&A and R&D leverage while holding our industry-leading gross margins relatively flat. At the same time, we made investments in markets where we see future growth. When I came to Medtronic, I decided that initially our 3 main areas of focus would be accelerating globalization, optimizing innovation and improving execution. We're making notable progress in these areas. First, let's discuss globalization. Our FY '12 international revenue grew 7%, with emerging markets growing 20%. Our team came together nicely, following the global reorganization we implemented in the fall. Over the past year, I've traveled extensively visiting our operations around the world, and I am seeing firsthand the improving alignment between our business units and geographies. Everywhere I go, I'm impressed by our local teams' skill and dedication as well as their deep knowledge of our customers and markets. I've also been positively surprised by the sizable opportunity that exists in emerging markets to expand the use of our existing products.","Longer term, we're also taking the necessary steps to enter the value segment more aggressively. We continue to reduce product costs through our continuous COGS reduction program, which gives us the flexibility to offer a variety of tiered products. We're also actively investigating opportunities to increase local R&D and manufacturing in emerging markets. Through this the structured approach, we intend to grow our emerging market revenue from 10% of the overall company revenue in FY '11 to 20% over the coming years.","We have also focused in optimizing innovation, including improving our R&D productivity. While it is still early and we have a lot of work ahead of us, we did see some progress in FY '12 toward our goal of getting more growth with the same or perhaps less levels of R&D and M&A investment. As we went through our FY '13 planning process, we made specific efforts to reallocate resources into driving growth in emerging markets and in evidence generation for our growth platforms. As part of this process, we eliminated a number of development programs in order to focus on projects that are more strictly aligned with our strategy and expected to deliver sustained short- and long-term business results.","We also assessed all programs and their ability to deliver economic value to the customer, which is increasingly becoming a critical factor in today's changing healthcare environment. We're engaging in active discussions with a number of major payors around the world to begin partnerships of specific economic value programs. One example is an agreement we recently reached with the government of Lombardy, the largest region in Italy, to partner on outcomes research and MedTech efficiency. This unique program will evaluate the quality and overall treatment cost of chronic disease for several Medtronic technologies.","Here in the U.S., we are also in initial discussions with Aetna regarding chronic disease management partnerships in diabetes and heart failure. Both of these partners have rich sources of patient outcome data, which is essential for the quick and effective evaluation of economic value. Partnerships like this will not only be beneficial to Medtronic but will also help support the sustainability of healthcare systems around the world.","We believe strongly that the ability to translate clinical value into economic value will be the key area of differentiation for success in healthcare over the longer term. We're excited about our strategy in this area and look forward to telling you more at our Investor Conference next week.","Let's now address my third initiative, driving crisp and consistent execution across the organization. We made improvements to our business alignment, ensuring focus and efficiency throughout our business units and regions. I've also focused our management team on improving operating rigor, which has resulted in addressing issues in a more proactive and decisive fashion. I'm seeing improvements in execution from our operating teams around the world, and the results of our efforts are beginning to show in our financial performance. We delivered total company revenue growth of 3% in FY '12, which improved through the year and finished at the upper end of the revenue range we provided at the beginning of the year. In the vast majority of businesses, we maintained or grew our share over the course of FY '12. We also delivered non-GAAP FY '12 EPS consistent with our guidance. Going forward, we will maintain our focus on execution, which we expect to result in improved and more predictable business performance.","Let's turn now to our Q4 results. Revenue growth of 4% was driven by solid performances across many of our businesses. Our U.S. ICD business showed sequential improvement as it was helped by the continued trend of market stabilization and expectation that we highlighted for you last quarter. In Q4, after excluding U.S. Spine, the remaining 87% of our business grew 7%, a marked improvement from the 4% growth we had in this portion of our business last quarter. Our international revenue grew 7% in Q4, including 20% growth in emerging markets, with strong finishes to the year, with growth well in excess of 20% in Central and Eastern Europe, Greater China and India. Looking ahead, I believe sustained emerging market growth greater than 20% continues to be a realistic goal.","In CVG, as I just mentioned, we continued to see signs of stabilization in the U.S. ICD market. Our U.S. ICD revenue declined 2% this quarter, which was a major improvement from the 14% decline last quarter, especially in light of decreasing hospital inventories. Our implant rates showed year-over-year growth for the first time in 6 quarters, and this trend is continuing. Growth in our overall high-power replacement share offset modest declines in our CRT-D initial implant share, resulting in flat total high-power market share. In fact, for the first 4 years -- in fact for the past 4 years, our U.S. ICD share has remained in a tight band. Apart from a couple of one-time events, our share today remains right in the middle of this band, and our expectation is to maintain or improve our share going forward.","Before moving on, I'd also like to note that in Pacing, we continued to gain significant share on the strength of our MRI devices, both in the U.S. and in international markets. Our global Pacing share is now at its highest point in 4 years.","Turning to Coronary. I want to acknowledge the impressive early results from the U.S. launch of Resolute Integrity, which sequentially doubled our U.S. DES revenue and our corresponding market share. This impressive share growth is attributable to the strong performance characteristics and long-term clinical evidence of Resolute Integrity, as well as solid execution by our Coronary commercial team. It is also a clear example of how leveraging the unmatched breadth of our entire CVG field organization can drive differential results. We use field personnel from across our CVG organization, including the extensive field sales and clinical support network of CRDM to meaningfully accelerate and expand the Resolute Integrity launch. Recognizing the power of our broad cardiac and vascular offerings, some of our competitors are now attempting to replicate our strategy, either on their own or through partnerships. However, only Medtronic has the ability to seamlessly provide a full breadth of leading technologies for our customers, both today and in the future. With the launch of Resolute Integrity, we are now able to offer a comprehensive set of leading technologies across the Cardiac and Vascular space. Next week, at our Investor Conference, Mike Coyle will tell you more about the increasing competitive advantage this represents in our ability to engage customers.","Let me now discuss our RTG business. I want to first acknowledge the success of our full U.S. and Japan launches of the RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator. RestoreSensor grow over 6 points of sequential U.S. share gain and contributed to a doubling of our neuromodulation business growth rate in Q4 versus the prior quarter. We expect to sustain this improved growth rate over the coming quarters.","Our Surgical Technologies business had an outstanding Q4, growing 25%. Our new Advanced Energy business was a strong contributor to this growth, and I've been very pleased by the Advanced Energy's integration efforts as well as their continued growth trajectory. It's also impressive to note that even after excluding the impact of Advanced Energy, Surgical Technologies grew 14% organically. This was driven by strong capital equipment sales from ENT and navigation, which collectively grew 17%. Surgical Technologies is now nearly a $1.3 billion business and is an increasingly important contributor to our growth profile. It also plays a very important role in our broader neuroscience strategies, which Chris O'Connell will explain at our Investor Conference next week.","Now let me discuss our Spine business. While the total business declined 6%, our International Spine business actually delivered a strong performance in Q4, growing 8% and is now annualizing at over $1 billion. This business is particularly strong in China where our joint venture with Weigao is delivering solid results. I expect continued growth in International Spine while we focus in improving our U.S. Spine business.","Turning to U.S. Spine. Q4 revenue declined 12% with roughly 60% of this decline driven by INFUSE. In order to isolate the issues in U.S. Spine, it is important to look at the business across its 3 parts, namely BKP, INFUSE and core. Our U.S. BKP business was flat, which was encouraging after 10 consecutive quarters of decline, as our new products begin to gain traction. U.S. INFUSE declined 26% in Q4 but was relatively stable sequentially. Until we know the results of the Yale study, which we expect in Q2, there will continue to be uncertainty about our INFUSE financial results. As I've said before, we believe in the safety and efficacy of INFUSE for approved indications. However, we want to address any controversies by understanding the facts, which is why we requested Yale University to systematically analyze all the available data. In addition, we were pleased by the U.S. Department of Justice decision to close its investigation of INFUSE. We took the investigation very seriously and invested significant resources to identify the facts with complete transparency.","Now let's discuss our U.S. core business, including Other Biologics, which declined 7% and drove the remaining 40% of the decline in U.S. Spine. We're making changes to our strategy in order to restore the performance of this business, including innovating and differentiating Medtronic at both the product level and procedural level. We're investing in local product development and locations around the globe. We're also beginning to use breadth of our technologies more effectively in the neuroscience space. And finally, one of the biggest changes we're making is to incorporate economic value into the commercial messaging of our existing products, as well as into our new product selection process. Chris O'Connell will review these Spine strategies in detail at our Investor Conference next week.","Let me now address our operating results in Q4. In delivering non-GAAP EPS of $0.99, we made some conscious trade-offs during the quarter to take advantage of some compelling investment opportunities. As a result of this, SG&A spending came in higher than we had originally forecasted. As we move through the quarter, we could see that our new products were driving strong revenue and market share growth. And at the same time, we were able to execute the sales lease back financing strategy that directly benefited the bottom line through a reduction in tax expense. This presented a unique opportunity to make some focused sales and marketing investments, including pulling in some planned spending from FY '13. We believe this was the right decision, and we expect to see the payoff from these investments as we go through the next fiscal year.","Before turning the call over to Gary, I want to briefly address our capital allocation strategy, which remains an important commitment to our shareholders and a key driver of long-term value creation. We continue to generate significant free cash flow, including nearly $4 billion in FY '12. We returned $2.5 billion of this to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders, which still provides us with ample flexibility to make disciplined investments for sustainable growth.","Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results. And at the end of the call, I will make some brief closing comments. Gary?","Gary L. Ellis","Thanks, Omar. Fourth quarter revenue of $4,297,000,000 increased 3% as reported and 4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for a $42 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. Q4 revenue results by region were as follows. Growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 27%. South Asia grew 25%. Growth in Greater China was 23%. Middle East and Africa grew 16%. Growth in Latin America was 11%. Asia-Pacific grew 6%, including a 7% growth in Japan. Growth in our Western Europe and Canada region was 4%, while the U.S. grew 2%, which is the highest quarterly growth we have achieved in the U.S. in 2 years. Emerging markets grew a combined 20% in Q4 and represented 11% of our total sales mix. Q4 GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $991 million and $0.94, an increase of 28% and 31%, respectively. After adjusting for certain acquisition-related items, Physio-Control divestiture-related items and net restructuring charges and certain litigation charges and the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, fourth quarter earnings and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $1,036,000,000 and $0.99, an increase of 7% and 10%, respectively.","In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2,253,000,000 grew 4%. Results were driven by growth in Coronary, transcatheter valves, endovascular, AF Solutions, renal denervation and Peripheral, partially offset by small declines in Pacing and ICDs.","CRDM revenue of $1,295,000,000 was flat. Worldwide ICD revenue of $744 million declined 1%, and we estimate that the worldwide ICD market declined in the mid-single digits. Both the market and our results showed sequential improvement in Q4. In addition, our global ICD share improved on both a year-over-year basis and sequential basis. The combination of our Protecta ICD with its shock reduction and lead Integrity alert technologies, along with a proven long-term performance of our Sprint Quattro leads, continues to perform well, both in terms of share and pricing. In the U.S. ICD market, it is worth noting that the market did stabilize this quarter, as expected, even as we continued to see a reduction in customer inventory levels.","Pacing revenue of $492 million declined 2%, and the market declined in the low single digits. Our MRI SureScan pacemakers continue to drive our market outperformance as we continue to gain share in both the U.S. and international markets. Our AF Solutions business had solid growth in excess of 20%, despite anniversary-ing the U.S. launch of the Arctic Front cryoballoon. We continue to take share in this important growth market.","Cardiovascular had an outstanding quarter, with revenue of $958 million growing 10%, with 9% growth in the U.S. and 11% growth in international markets. Coronary revenue of $450 million grew 12% on the global strength of Resolute Integrity. Worldwide DES revenue in the quarter was $243 million, including $80 million of U.S. revenue. Resolute Integrity's deliverability, unique diabetes indication and long-term clinical performance received a strong customer acceptance during our recent U.S. launch, resulting in a doubling of our market share in less than a quarter. U.S. DES market pricing was relatively stable sequentially, with pricing down in the mid-single digits year-over-year.","In international markets, we gained 150 basis points of DES share sequentially on the continued strength of Resolute Integrity, with particularly strong performances in Europe and China. We look forward to extending our DES share with continued expansion in the U.S. and our expected launch of Resolute Integrity in the important Japanese market. We expect to become the global market share leader in coronary stents in FY '13, adding to our market-leading positions in ICDs, pacemakers and endovascular stent grafts.","Turning to renal denervation. We continue to lay the groundwork to realize the multibillion opportunity in hypertension, with major investments in our product pipeline, clinical evidence and market development, including building therapy awareness and care pathways. In Q4, we received approval for our SYMPLICITY system in Canada as we continued to expand this therapy into markets beyond Western Europe. We continue to enroll our U.S. pivotal study and remain on track for U.S. approval in FY '15. In FY '13, we expect our renal denervation revenue to nearly double to $60 million to $70 million. We intend to maintain our leadership based on our robust pipeline, growing breadth and depth of our long-term safety and efficacy data and strong intellectual property in both the U.S. and international markets.","Structural heart revenue of $289 million increased 7%, driven by strong growth in transcatheter valves. This quarter, data was announced at ACC and EuroPCR from our advanced study, one of the largest prospective, multicenter TAVI trials to date, which showed high procedural success combined with positive clinical outcomes and low complication rates with our CoreValve system. In the international markets, we continued to gain share, and we are the clear market leader in transfemoral, the largest TAVI segment. Our larger 31-millimeter CoreValve continues to perform well, bringing TAVI technology to a previously untreatable patient population. Cardiac surgeons are also increasingly attracted to our direct aortic approach, an alternative to transapical implantation. We will introduce our next-generation TAVI system later this year, which will leverage CoreValves' strong market and clinical performance while integrating new technologies to enhance deliverability and anatomical fit, as well as provide valve recapture ability. In the U.S., we are pleased with the progress of our pivotal trial. Enrollment in our extreme-risk arm is complete, and we are enrolling patients through a continued access. We expect our high-risk arm to be fully enrolled this summer.","Turning to endovascular and Peripheral. Revenue of $219 million grew 10%. Our Endurant Abdominal Stent Graft continues to drive performance in markets around the globe, including Japan, where it was launched in Q4. Endurant II, our next-generation AAA Stent Graft is performing well in Europe, and we are pleased to announce that we recently received FDA approval for U.S. launch.","In Peripheral, our drug-eluting balloons are delivering strong double-digit growth in international markets. At EuroPCR last week, 2 randomized controlled trials were presented that demonstrated the advantage of our IN.PACT drug-eluting balloon over uncoated balloons and drug-eluting stents. We intend to be in enrollment soon for our 1,500 patient global DEB study that will ultimately include more than 80 sites in over 30 countries. In the U.S., we began enrollment in our IN.PACT SFA II pivotal study in late April. On the commercial front, in the U.S., Assurant Cobalt Iliac Stent and Complete SE Vascular Stent are posting very solid results.","Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $2,044,000,000 grew 4%. Growth was driven by strong performances in Surgical Technologies, diabetes and neuromodulation, partially offset by declines in U.S. Spine. Global Spine revenue of $818 million declined 6% or down 2% after excluding the negative impact of U.S. INFUSE. International Spine grew 8%, including over 20% growth in the important Japanese market. In core spine, which includes core metal constructs, IPDs and BKP products, revenue of $629 million declined 3%. The U.S. core market continues to decline in the low single digits, with flat procedural growth and mid-single-digit pricing declines partially offset by positive mix. Our core metal construct products declined 3% but grew 5% sequentially. We continue to focus on a number of initiatives to improve performance, including the continued launches of Solera, POWEREASE, ATLANTIS VISION ELITE and our MAST MIDLF and navigated DLIF procedures. While we are still early in these efforts, we do expect their contribution to our growth to increase over the coming quarters.","BKP revenue grew 1%, an encouraging result, given this is the first time BKP has grown in nearly 3 years. Biologics revenue of $189 million declined 16% in the quarter. BMP sales declined 24% in the quarter, including a 26% decline in the U.S. However, it is important to note that INFUSE is one of our lower-margin products, muting its impact to our bottom line. Despite the increased pressure on INFUSE, our differentiated DBM offerings, including MagniFuse and Grafton, are driving double-digit growth in Other Biologics, including mid-teens growth in the U.S.","Turning to neuromodulation. Revenue of $463 million increased 8%, led by the strong acceptance in the U.S. and Japan of our RestoreSensor spinal cord stimulator. RestoreSensor with its proprietary AdaptiveStim technology allowed us to capture over 600 basis points of U.S. market share sequentially. Our DBS business had its strongest quarter in recent history, as our strategy to focus on neurologists' referrals is yielding results. Our Uro\/Gastro business delivered strong double-digit growth in Q4, driven by acceleration of new InterStim implant growth. In fact, pain stim, DBS and InterStim all saw the strongest U.S. new implant rates in years.","Diabetes revenue of $392 million grew 8%, driven by double-digit growth in CGM and solid growth in insulin pumps. Our international diabetes business delivered another strong quarter, as we continue to see great acceptance of our Veo pump with Low Glucose Suspend, augmented by our Enlite Sensor and its improved comfort, accuracy and ease of use.","Surgical Technologies revenue of $371 million grew 25%, which included $34 million of revenue from Advanced Energy. Navigation had a strong 18% growth performance in the quarter, in Q4, led by capital equipment sales, including the StealthStation S7 and the O-arm. ENT also had a strong Q4 with growth of 16% driven by sales of image-guided surgery and power equipment.","Turning to rest of the income statement, the Q4 gross margin was 75.6%. After adjusting for the 30-basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, the Q4 gross margin was 75.9%. In FY '12, we completed our initial $1 billion COGS reduction program, which allowed us to mitigate pricing pressure, but we are not stopping there. In FY '13, we are starting a new product cost-reduction program with a goal of reducing COGS by more than $1 billion over the next 5 years. For FY '13, we expect gross margins in the range of 75.5% to 76% on an operational basis.","Fourth quarter R&D spending of $393 million was 9.1% of revenue. We remain committed to investing in new technologies and evidence-creation to drive future growth, and for FY '13, we expect R&D spending to be approximately 9%. Fourth quarter SG&A expenditures of $1,462,000,000 represented 34% of sales. This result was above the range we provided on our Q3 call. As Omar mentioned earlier, given the strong revenue that we saw from product launches in Q4, we decided mid-quarter to increase investment in these launches to maximize our share capture, as well as pull forward some planned FY '13 expenses in renal denervation in emerging markets. We expect to realize the return on these investments in FY '13.","In addition, our Coronary and Surgical Tech businesses had extremely strong quarters, with results well above our expectations, which led to higher incentive payouts and contribute to the higher SG&A expense this quarter. We continued to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses. In FY '13, we would expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in SG&A in the range of 34.2% to 34.4%.","Amortization expense for the quarter was $80 million compared to $87 million last year. For FY '13, we would expect amortization expense to be approximately $80 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $48 million, driven by our hedging program expense. As you know, we hedge much of our operating results to reduce the volatility of our earnings. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY '13 net other expense will be in the range of $185 million to $225 million, which includes the expected impact from the U.S. MedTech tax that will begin in January 2013, as well as higher royalty expense due to increased sales of Resolute Integrity. For Q1 FY '13, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million based on current exchange rates.","Net interest expense for the quarter was $46 million, excluding the $22 million non-cash charge for convertible debt interest expense. Non-GAAP net interest expense was $24 million. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $10.3 billion in cash and cash investments and $10.6 billion of debt. For FY '13, we expect non-GAAP net interest expense in the range of $70 million to $80 million, which excludes the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.","Let's now turn to our tax rate. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was 13.9%. Excluding the impact of one-time items, our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the quarter was 16.7%. Included in this rate was our favorable operational tax adjustments, which include the release of a valuation allowance associated with the usage of capital loss carryover and the impact of the finalization of multiple state and foreign tax returns. Excluding the impact of one-time items, our FY '12 tax rate was 18.5%. For FY '13, we expect an adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19.25% to 20.25%.","During FY '12, we generated almost $4 billion in free cash flow. We remain committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In FY '12, we have paid over $1 billion in dividends and repurchased over $1.4 billion of our common stock, which includes the share repurchases we executed to offset dilution from our divestiture of Physio-Control. As of the end of Q4, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 58 million shares. Fourth quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1,049,000,000 shares. During FY '13, we expect diluted weighted shares outstanding to decline by 30 to 35 million shares.","Let me conclude by providing our initial fiscal year 2013 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. While we believe our markets have improved modestly, we estimate market growth remains in the low single digits. Based on this, as well as the expected growth from recent product launches, we believe that constant currency revenue growth of 2% to 4% is reasonable for FY '13 and would reflect improvement from our organic growth in FY '12. While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY '13 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $330 million to $337 million, including a negative $100 million to $120 million impact in Q1.","Turning to guidance on the bottom line. Based on expected constant currency revenue growth of 2% to 4%, we believe it is reasonable to model earnings per share in the range of $3.62 to $3.70, which implies FY '13 earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we would point out that the current consensus reflects Q1 earnings per share growth of 10%, which is outside our issued guidance, and therefore, we would not be surprised to see some modest shifts -- modest -- models shift a couple of pennies from Q1 to Q4. As in the past, my comments and guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year, nor do they include the impact of the noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.","With that, Omar and I would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. Operator, first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First off on the guidance, the 2% to 4% constant currency, Gary, when you look at the major regions, are you assuming this coming year the U.S. grows a little bit versus really not growing last year? And then what's your assumption for Europe?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes, well, overall, in the 2% to 4% assumption we have there, basically, it depends on where you're at in the range. If you're at the higher end of the range, obviously, you would assume a slight growth in the U.S. If you're at the lower end, you're probably assuming that the U.S. is more flat at that point. So low single digits at best for the U.S. Europe, we're assuming basically more kind of what they did during the current year, which is more in the mid-single digits. And obviously, within Europe, that will vary by country. A lot of the Northern European countries are still doing very well, Germany, et cetera. Obviously, some of the Southern European countries, we\u2019re a little bit more cautious about, and that's why we're giving guidance more in the middle -- mid-single digits.","Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just one more question on SYMPLICITY. It seemed like everyone and their mother was launching a renal denervation device at EuroPCR. You paid a lot of money for Ardian. At what point does IP become an advantage for you? Do we have to wait for the U.S? Or is it possible in Europe, we could see some movement on the litigation front?","Gary L. Ellis","Let me kind of respond, and Omar might have a comment too. But overall, the -- we have strong IP around Ardian and even some things that we have been doing ourselves. We have strong IP ourselves, plus what we've got with Ardian, both in the U.S. and international. So you should -- we do not -- we won't -- we'll address that as we go forward as far as what other people are launching, but we do have strong IP in both the U.S. and outside the U.S.","Omar S. Ishrak","I think the only thing that I'll add is just to reinforce that we're investing heavily and are committed to keep our leadership in both our technology, as well as in clinical trials and increasing the number of indications.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, let me just clear up on the quarter. So the decision intra-quarter to increase the SG&A spend, did that reflect as well the knowledge that your tax rate would come in lower than it did? Because that was the principle delta versus street models was tax, not SG&A.","Gary L. Ellis","That's correct, Mike. I mean, we saw 2 things. Obviously, as we were going through the quarter, we saw the uplift occurring very strongly in some of the new product launches. But at the same time, we clarified the sale leaseback strategy and saw that we were going to have more of a benefit on the tax line, gave us an opportunity to invest a little bit sooner than what we had initially thought. And so that's -- that was the plan mid-quarter once we knew that the sale leaseback transaction was going to occur.","Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Let me ask a couple of questions about the FY '13 guidance. So number one, how are you thinking about INFUSE and the potential outcomes of the Yale study, one? And two, Gary, I thought we'd see more of a benefit in FY '13 from the exclusion of Physio-Control on the gross margin line. Am I off-base there? But I thought that should be about a 50-basis-point impact.","Gary L. Ellis","Well, let me -- just first of all, on the gross margin line as far as the impact from Physio-Control, you're right. Physio-Control had a lower gross margin in general than the rest of the corporation, and so that has been pulled out. And you see even on the results now, where all the years have been restated to include Physio-Control out, so there is a slight positive having Physio come out of the numbers because it's a bit of a lower margin. So -- but overall, we still believe we'll maintain those gross margins even, for example, Q4 here, the 75.9 is still comparable with that FX adjustment versus what we had in Q3 with Physio-Control pulled out. So I mean, the reality is they are comparable. But you are correct, Mike, in that with Physio pulled out, it gives us a slight upward pressure on the margin. On the other hand, some of the things that we've been doing thus far is adding some of the newer products, for example, on Surgical Tech and some of those products grow as that business grows. Those are a little bit lower, below the overall corporation's gross margin. So there's a mix benefit that we're having to deal with as we go forward, but physio did have a benefit on the item -- on the gross margin, excuse me, as far as getting rid of that business. And the other question was INFUSE. On INFUSE, as far as what our assumptions are, what we have assumed is, obviously, that until the Yale results come out that we're going to probably -- until we anniversary really the INFUSE against when it started to fall, we are going to continue to see the financial results of that business being down. The good news is we did see -- as we indicated in our comments, we did see it sequentially kind of flat as far as the absolute number, Q4 versus Q3. But I think it's fair to say, INFUSE will continue to be a drag and a headwind for us, and until we see what the results of the Yale study are. And so right now, it is -- it will continue to be a drag for, at least, the next several months, couple of quarters, until we get the Yale results, and then we'll have to assess after that what the potential impact will be.","Omar S. Ishrak","I think the main thing that we're looking to here to the Yale studies is that the levels of uncertainty before that are somewhat greater. And we hope the Yale study will clarify things factually and will, at least, make things more certain and predictable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just several -- one very quick housekeeping item. Was there an extra day in the quarter? The next one is the renal denervation deluge at PCR almost suggested that SYMPLICITY is obsolete, and x U.S. with the IP is more of a problem probably. How do you expect to respond to that? And then the advanced study looked solid on the top line, but the pacer issue remained, even with the ACCU TRACK, and there was the French registry suggestion there's more paravalvular leak with CoreValve, at least, with the transfemoral approach. Just any responses to that stuff?","Gary L. Ellis","All right. I think there was 3 questions there, but I'll try to get through all of them quickly here. As far as extra day, easy answer there is no. We have same day -- number of days as the prior year. With respect to Ardian and our SYMPLICITY product line, yes, we-- there are a lot of people, obviously, trying to enter this market. We have been in the market. We feel good about where we're at with our product line. I think it's fair to say you should assume that, that's not our -- going to be our only generation. We are looking for enhancements to the product as we go forward, too, and especially with our catheter-based technology and our -- overall, we feel very, very strong about that. Mike will go in more detail next week at the Investor Conference and walk you through kind of exactly what's happening with that business, but the reality is we feel very good about our competitive position. But we've said all along, we knew there would be competition trying to come into this market place that highlights the strength of the potential benefit in this market and the industry in general. And the reality is, as we try to get reimbursement set up, having a few more competitors, helping us with that burden is not necessarily a bad thing. But we feel good about our competitive position and our IP position as we go forward, and we feel very good about our technology. With transcatheter valves, I'm not the one to get real specific about what's happening with the technology part. All I can -- on the pacing issue, we are continuing to focus on that. The focus on the pacing issue that's been out there, the reality is it hasn't impacted anything in the marketplace. We continue to take share in the marketplace, and we continue to work to improve that to have an effect -- minimize that effect if we can as we go forward, which we think we can do. On the other hand, it clearly has not impacted the product line in the marketplace at this point in time, and we feel good about the technology with our transcatheter valve technology.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So first, just a follow-up on 2013 guidance. Given that going back in the last year or 2, obviously, ICDs and Spine have been the things hampering your growth the most. I was wondering, can you give us a sense in your 2013 guidance what are you assuming for the ICD and Spine kind of market growth rates? And then growth rates for Medtronic specifically?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, let me take a shot at that. This is Gary, and then Omar can maybe add some comments as he gets into it all -- overall also, as you indicated. By the way, I want to clarify one point that I did have in the commentary related to the guidance. I mentioned the foreign exchange impact were up by '13, and I said $330 million to $337 million. That should have been $330 million to $370 million. So I just wanted to clarify that, Bob. It wasn't one of your questions, but I'll throw it in here. With respect to your question about the guidance on the 2% to 4% and what our assumptions are, that -- as we indicated in our comments, that assumes overall that the market kind of grows in that low single digit, kind of 2% to 3% range in general for all of our product lines. That's a little bit faster, slightly faster than what we saw in the current year, and that primarily reflects the fact that we would expect to see some improvement, as we\u2019ve indicated, in the U.S. ICD market as we've seen that stabilizing. Overall, again, obviously, our Q4 results were very strong. And if that trends would continue, we would probably at the higher end of that 2% to 4% even revenue guidance that we've provided. Our point is what we're trying to do on the guidance is just highlight the fact that, as you indicated, we did see some volatility in these markets in the last year. And until we see more stabilization and a continued stabilization really in the ICD and Spine markets, we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in the guidance, but basically, this assumes -- this guidance right now would assume that overall, the spine markets, for example, would continue to be down slightly, and we'd be down low- to mid-single digits. That's including INFUSE, obviously, in there, and that our ICDs, again, the market is flat to slightly down, and we'd be the same way, flat to slightly down in -- on the ICDs.","Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just some quick follow-ups. Gary, can you just help us add up all the guidance you gave on the various line items? And what are you assuming overall for operating margin leverage in 2013? And then for Omar, can you just give us a quick comment on the Analyst Day and what we should expect, especially as it relates to any thoughts you might provide on aspirational growth goals going forward and anything you'd like to highlight about what we should be looking forward to on the Analyst Day?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes, let me address just quickly the -- our assumptions for next year. We are assuming some operating leverage, obviously, with a 2% to 4% revenue growth and then earnings per share growing 5% to 7%, even with the share buyback that we would continue to do. We are assuming that there is operating leverage, primarily in the SG&A line, as we indicated in the comments. We're assuming that gross margin basically stays relatively flat with our -- that we can offset the price erosion with the product take -- the cost takeout that we've been continuing to do. And that R&D is actually relatively flat also versus what we have in the current year. So our assumption for next year is SG&A does improve, as we indicated in the comments, 30 to 50 basis points of kind of an improvement overall. And that would be then the operating leverage we would also see. Now at the same time, we're also on the other income and expense line item, having to offset the medical device tax. So even just achieving some leverage of 30 to 50 basis points on the operating margins, we feel pretty strongly, that's pretty good results in this environment with pricing pressures and taking on some additional costs on the med device tax issue. Omar?","Omar S. Ishrak","Yes. Regarding the Investor Meeting, we're pulling together a pretty good meeting for you. Some things will be the same, as you've experienced before, in the sense that we\u2019ll give you a pretty good walk-through of our product pipeline and technologies, and Mike and Chris will go through that in a fair amount of depth. But in addition, we will also be discussing with you how we are repositioning the company to participate in the changing environment and particularly around how do we translate our focus in economic value to real programs, to real decisions and eventually sustainable growth and why that's so important. The other thing we\u2019ll give you details of is, obviously, our globalization strategy and we're really excited about that, and we want to share with you, again, details around that. So that will be the net mix of it and, overall, details around our strategic changes, as well as depth in our product pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Bob's. So it sounds like you will not be giving any sort of longer-term growth goals at the Analyst Meeting?","Gary L. Ellis","Kristen, this Gary. I mean, no, I mean, we'll obviously talk about our -- we're giving guidance for FY '13, and we'll walk through that again. I mean, we'll get into some of the things as far as where we think some of the markets are going and what we believe that long-term we could see in some of these objectives and even aspirationally what we'd all like to see as far as when these markets return back. But we're not going to get into long-term guidance right now. I mean, these markets are just too volatile. It's hard to predict even kind of a year out, let alone to give more guidance past that.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just to go back to your comments on gross margin, can you just repeat the guidance for the year on the gross margin line? And I think you had said that was on an operational basis. So is that just, I guess, excluding FX? And what sort of impact would we expect to see if we look at gross margins on a more reported basis?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. I mean, right now, we would say 75.5% to 76% on the gross margin, which is kind of consistent with where we're at in the current year, and we expect to be able to maintain that. And based on where we're currently at, I -- we're probably right in that range still. Obviously, based on the foreign exchange, where the foreign exchange rates would be at, we'd probably be towards the lower end of that range just as we saw this quarter, where we were at more 75.6% because of the negative FX impact aspect of it. If FX currency would happen to turn around and go a little bit more the other way, you could be at the higher end of the range. So it's really more within that range. It's consistent. It just depends on what -- whether you're at the higher or the lower end depends on what happens with the FX rates.","Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just the MedTech tax, that's going to be in other operating expense. A lot of your competitors have said that they expect it to be more within SG&A. Can you maybe just help us understand, I know it's just for one quarter in FY '13, but just kind of what the quarterly run rate is going to be both from a pretax and post-tax basis?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. As we\u2019ve said over -- as we go forward, obviously, first of all, these rules are still getting developed, and so the regulations are not final yet. And even where you actually account for this is not final. There's been a lot of debate back-and-forth between SG&A and other expense. Right now, our assumption is other expense and -- but we'll have to firm that up as we obviously work with this with our -- with the accountants and everybody else. We're obviously the first ones who will be having it, and so that's where we'll have to make sure we get that resolved as we go forward. As we've indicated previously, the overall impact for a full year, we still estimate -- and there's still a big range on this because it is still not clear exactly what is in and out on the revenue side of the equation. But we're expecting a 12-month impact of about $120 million to $150 million, somewhere in that range. So for 4 months, which is what we\u2019ll be covered with for the current -- for FY '13, we have about $40 million to $50 million assumed in our guidance related to FY '13. And as you indicated, it's in that other income and expense line item.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions, 1 for Gary and 1 for Omar. Gary, thanks for giving us the guidance for the next 5 years in the $1 billion cost restructuring program. I guess, can you just help us understand for this coming year fiscal '13 sort of what are you assuming for price in some of your major franchises, whether that\u2019d be DES, CRM or Spine? If we can't get an absolute basis, just on a relative basis, does sort of fiscal '13 guidance assume price pressure stable with '12? Or does it assume some acceleration versus '12? And as you think about the next 5 years and the $1 billion program versus the last $1 billion program, do you kind of assume similar-type pricing declines? Or do you assume an acceleration in the pricing environment?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, overall, I'll just -- as far as the pricing assumptions overall, we're assuming that for FY '13 and as we go forward, the pricing pressure remains somewhat consistent with what we saw, obviously, in FY '12. That will vary by business as we go forward. For example, we have seen some stabilization even, for example, in drug-eluting stent pricing in the U.S. And so maybe that's not going to be quite as extreme as it was in FY '12. On the other hand, you could see continued pressure in other product lines. So our assumption, as we do this, is that you -- again across all of our business, you were probably kind of seeing that in the range of 2% to 3%. But as you know, it varies dramatically between businesses, whether it's drug-eluting stents to obviously some product lines continuing to see price uplifts. And new technology, obviously, gets price uplifts as we continue to see that. So we're assuming it's somewhat consistent with FY '12, not dramatically different than that in that it would continue. And then as a result of that, we do believe that our $1 billion -- over $1 billion cost-out program, going forward, will allow us to continue to maintain kind of the gross margins of where we've been at. Now you should -- I want to make it clear, that's kind of what we're committing to right now on the $1 billion. We're trying to drive that for even more to give us more flexibility, such that if there was even more pricing pressure, or as Omar has mentioned many times, as we go down into -- as we go focus on even going in the value segment, it gives us the opportunity to even tier our products such that we could have different pricing points as we move forward. So the cost-out program is -- the 25%, we feel very good about being able to achieve that. But we are trying to work this to try to be driving them more than that to give us even more flexibility and potentially offsetting any risks that there might even be more pricing pressure than what we've seen in the current year. But right now, our assumption is that it continues, that we will continue to have pricing pressure. But back to what we've seen historically, we've been able to offset that over the last 5 years, and we believe confidently we can continue to do that.","David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Very helpful. And then Omar, maybe just one more quick question for you. You talked about the value segment, I think. I found those comments pretty interesting. I think a lot of investors think about the value segment as an emerging market concept. Maybe you can talk about what does the value concept mean to you in developed markets? And can you start bringing some of these value device type products and commentary into the U.S. market or the developed European market?","Omar S. Ishrak","I think, absolutely, there's an opportunity for that. I mean, I think if we go aggressively after emerging markets in creating that value segment, that automatically positions us to create products at a lower tier. And we intend to -- as we look at the U.S. and the developed markets, as we see opportunities, especially where there's heavy pricing pressure and the feature sets are not being used and people aren't paying the price for those, we will go into our resources and product lines and the value segment and introduce them in the U.S. and developed markets. But at the same time, we will differentiate them adequately so that the price of our higher-tier products and the value that they generate remain, and -- but we think that as the pressures on cost savings in the developed world and the healthcare systems increase, there will be room for different tiered service lines. And if we can execute well in our global strategy for value segments, this will give us a significant advantage in developed markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wonder if I could ask a little bit more on the ICD business. I think it was in the fourth quarter of last year, you saw a pretty big falloff due to a lack of bulk sales. Did you see any reversal of that in the quarter? Or maybe could you describe what bulk sales look like in the quarter?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes. I mean, as we indicated in our comments, the reality is, actually, we saw even continued hospital inventory declines. And actually, the bulk purchases are at -- probably at the lowest level we've seen in 3 years overall. So they're actually even lower than what we saw last quarter -- excuse me, last year during this period of time. So that trend continues. I think that's what even our competitors have been indicating that we are seeing hospitals cutting back a little bit more on their inventory levels. And we've seen that over the last several quarters and as you indicated, even last year, we saw it. So that's our point as we highlight this. Even if you take that in consideration, the reality is we thought that we were happy to see the stabilization in the marketplace overall for ICDs, but to take into consideration the fact that, that was going on between ourselves and the competitors. And the fact is the implant rates are even stronger than what the actual results of ourselves -- the entire industry would show.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you gave a little bit of commentary in terms of within the ICD segment where you're seeing strength and weakness, and I think you mentioned, obviously, that you're seeing a little bit on the core ICD business or perhaps a bit weaker on the CRT-D side of it. I think we sort of probably understand why that is, but maybe you could give us a little more clarity around why you're seeing that discrepancy in those 2 segments.","Gary L. Ellis","Well, as you imagine, in CRT-D, there's obviously some trialing of a competitor product going on, and so that's clearly had some impact, and we saw a little bit of share their lost. Now that being said, we feel pretty confident that, that -- after that trialing is over, we will get back to more of a normal CRT-D. In fact, in Europe, where we -- obviously, the product\u2019s been in the marketplace for 2 years, we have the same unit share in CRT-D as we had prior to the competitive launch. So I mean, we feel confident. Yes, there's some trialing, and that has had some slight impact on -- in the CRT-D market or segment of the market. But then on the ICD side, we are obviously picking up share based on the strength of our product line and where we're at with some of its benefits. So net-net, overall, our market share has been basically relatively flat, and that's in spite of some of the trialing that's going on with the competitive product.","Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And in the core business, there were this highly publicized lead issue that one of your competitors is having, have you seen much of a benefit in both your lead sales on the ICD side and then, taking that a step further, the can business as well because of that?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, again, we're not going to get into what's going on with competitive product issues. We have, as we indicated in our comments, because the ICDs, we're seeing an increase in replacement on our share. Our replacement units are up, and we are seeing slight increases in our lead ratios as we look at those. So net-net, there's some impact probably in our business. But it's still to be managed through. Obviously, as I had indicated, we're losing a little bit share on the trialing of one product, but we're gaining share in other areas. I'm not going to speculate on how much of that is related to any one item.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Gary, I was hoping you'd go into a little bit more detail on the opportunistic SG&A spending that you picked up in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. As we think about those spending levels, to what extent is that necessary to generate the 2% to 4% revenue growth that you're guiding to in fiscal 2013? And I guess, the follow -- the sort of corollary to that would be how can you -- can you generate SG&A leverage and keep up the top line growth that you're talking about? Or is it sort of circular?","Gary L. Ellis","Well, overall, we -- again, the guidance we gave on the 2% to 4% assumes, obviously, we're going to continue to achieve leverage in the SG&A, because that was also in our guidance. So we're assuming we can do both, that we can continue to grow in that range and still achieve leverage on the SG&A. As far as what happened in the quarter here, again, a lot of what we saw was just on the strength of what was occurring already in the revenue. As you can assume, several of the businesses, Coronary, Structural -- excuse me, Surgical Technologies, as we mentioned in the comments, were having very, very strong quarters. Once you have -- you get above kind of your -- the quotas, et cetera, it becomes -- the incentives become very, very high, and they were resuming some very nice commissions and incentive payouts as a result of that performance overall. So that's higher than you would expect. At the same time, because of the benefit we saw on the tax line, as Omar mentioned in his comments and I said the same thing, is we did move some spending forward that we would -- we hired some sales reps that we were expecting to hire in FY '13 anyhow. We got started on some marketing programs with renal denervation. We accelerated some things in emerging markets that were going to occur in FY '13 and would've been in the expense structure that was in my guidance originally. So you shouldn't assume that -- and some of these items, obviously, in the quarter were also more one-time in nature just because of the strong revenue that was in some of the various businesses that won't be there once you have that in the quotas for next year. So net-net, we still feel very confident that even with the spending we saw here in the quarter that we can manage and can achieve the leverage we have for next year, and that should allow us to continue to grow the business, again, based on the 2% to 4% revenue growth.","David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then I think during the quarter, you had issued some debt, and I think in the release, you talked about that as a source to fund working capital. Can we just talk about the cash generation from a U.S., o U.S. perspective and to what extent the issuance of debt might become more the norm as you remain committed to that 50% payout of free cash flow in the context of -- for a greater percentage of revenue coming outside the United States?","Gary L. Ellis","Yes, well, as we've indicated, and we've been very clear about this overall, our U.S.-OUS cash split, I mean, we generated again about $4 billion of free cash flow in FY '12. Again, 60% to 65% of that is being generated outside of the United States, with 35% to 40% in the U.S. And so when we are returning 50% back to shareholders, by its very nature, which has to come from the U.S. cash piece, that does require us then at this point in time to, obviously, continue to have the debt levels slightly going up in the U.S. while cash builds outside of the United States. So our net cash position improves, but the reality is we are taking on more debt in the U.S. Now it's relatively low levels. The difference I'm talking about here is about $500 million to $600 million per year, which is well within our financial capability to handle. But as we've talked about, we're taking major efforts across our organization to try to say, \"How do we get that back more in line? How do we get back to a better split between the U.S. and OUS cash flow generation? And that includes a lot of initiatives underway to improve our working capital, especially inventory and capital expenditures. We have several initiatives underway across the company to drive that down, which should help drive the initiative. And as we talk through some of the comments and Omar's comments, we are focusing on shifting expenses to outside the United States where we can use that OUS cash. And so we are, in Spine, for example, we are doing R&D and manufacturing in other locations. We are shifting some of our marketing expenses even on the restructuring charges we talked about earlier. Some of what's going on here is we're shifting resources from the U.S. market to the markets that are growing. And so you are going to see a natural shift of some of those expenses outside the United States that will also help the issue. But currently, it is clearly -- creates a situation where we're having to borrow somewhat to continue our 50% commitment.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.","Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes, so I guess I just had a question on the Resolute Integrity launch. One of your competitors has talked about some trialing of that product going on, and obviously, you had a really strong quarter. But I'm just wondering to what degree do you think that, that type of sales trajectory is sustainable here. And then my second question would just be on the S-ICD product. What are your thoughts on that? What's the potential impact? And is that something that you're working on internally as well?","Gary L. Ellis","Okay. Well, with respect to Resolute Integrity and the strength there, obviously, we were very, very pleased with the launch and whenever you can double your share in effect in basically less than a couple of months, and right now, we are still probably only in probably 50% of the accounts that we'd like to be at this point in time. So it's still expanding quite dramatically as we go forward. So there is always -- with any product launch, there will be some who will trial it and might go back to other product lines. But the point you have to remember is this product line has performed well outside the United States. And we've seen people, obviously, try it and stay with it. And it's one of the leading products out -- has one of the leading shares outside the United States where it's been launched. And so as we've indicated before, we have every expectation that this product line, which is very, very competitive, it has on deliverability and, as we indicated, the diabetes indication, several things that are in its favor that it will also continue to be a well-accepted stent in the U.S. marketplace. And as we indicated, actually, the share came very quick, but we're not stopping there either. We believe that we still have opportunities with respect to this, and we think it's a very competitive product and will be one of the leading market share products in the U.S. as we go forward too.","Omar S. Ishrak","I think if I can just add a few words to that. I think we're only getting started in leveraging our CVG sales force, and we're getting traction from that already, and we expect that to accelerate as we go into accounts with our full value proposition of all our products. We think we've got significant growth ahead of us with that, and Mike will share that with you -- that strategy with you in greater detail at the Investors Conference next week.","Gary L. Ellis","And then your second part of the question related to, in effect, I'm assuming you're talking about Cameron Health product line that's out there, and Mike will also talk a little bit -- can talk about that more at the Analyst Meeting in more detail. But we really do see that it's kind of a niche kind of a product line that -- this is obviously the first-generation product that's coming forward. And there's a lot of other features that are in the current ICDs as far as PainFREE termination and pacing are kind of a standard part of it, and why you would want to give up on that, we have a question mark on that. But we're watching the market. We'll see how it plays out. But right now, we think it's more of a niche market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.","Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Omar, just a bigger picture question. You highlighted how pleased you are at the impact of the team reorganization, and you indicated you're surprised about -- separately at the opportunity to leverage existing products. Could you expand on this a little more? And am I right in reading this that sort of a year into your role at Medtronic that you're feeling more confident about driving gradually accelerating growth and steadily sustained or improving margins? Just any larger perspective on that?","Omar S. Ishrak","No, I think you're right. I think our strategy is to execute and to gradually increase our growth levels, but we'll take that a step at a time. We intend to align our strategies with the market realities, and that takes a little time. And when we've completely aligned them, we feel we can get sustained growth because there's growth available in healthcare. And an example of that process is exactly what you mentioned in our globalization effort, where we find that there\u2019s short-term growth available, simply by investing in market creation of existing products, which have high penetration rates in developed markets and have very low penetration rates amongst the affordable population of emerging markets. And by investing in addressing those barriers, we think we can get quick grow, and we're already beginning to see that in emerging markets. And longer-term, we use our cost reduction strategies in our products to create a value-tiered segments, which increases our penetration levels in emerging markets. And at the same time, as was pointed out earlier, we can leverage that capability to come back to developed markets and address the cost issues that are going to emerge in developed markets, and those pressures will increase. So what you'll see from us is a gradual realignment of our business in a step-by-step basis because a lot of things that we do today are of value. We have a product pipeline that's very exciting, and we think we can win in that space. And at the same time, we adjust our overall strategies to adjust to the new market realities that are happening, and we have to understand those, participate in those and lead those changes, and that's the way in which we'll grow and win in the future. Okay, well, thank you very much for your questions. And before I end today's call, I would like to remind you that we will host our Investor Conference next week on June 1 in New York. We look forward to discussing the progress we're making at the company to position ourselves to win like we just mentioned. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

My name is Jackie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.","All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you, Jackie. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s third quarter conference call and webcast.","During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 third quarter, which ended January 29, 2016. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by division summary. We also issued for the first time a presentation that provides additional details on our revenue performance and as a result had reduced our prepared revenue by division commentary in Gary\u2019s section.","Next, you should note that many of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2015, and our year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien\u2019s prior-year monthly results to Medtronic\u2019s fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning. And thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $6.9 billion, representing growth of 6% in the upper-half of our mid-single-digit baseline expectation. Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.06, growing at 17% on a comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 1,150 basis points of leverage, significantly above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points.","Our performance in Q3 was solid, with sustained execution, resulting in another quarter of market outperformance. We continue to deliver on our three growth strategies: therapy innovation, globalization and economic value; which are driving increased diversity of our growth, an important and differentiated attribute of our company.","Our revenue growth may modestly ebb and flow from quarter to quarter indicative of the challenges we\u2019re absorbing in certain businesses or regions as we capitalize on success in others. However, our confidence around the sustainability and consistency of our revenue growth within the mid-single-digit range continues to build with each passing quarter.","In addition, the Covidien integration is delivering robust operating leverage, as we realized our committed cost synergies, which combined with our financial leverage, drove high-teen EPS growth and double-digit EPS leverage in Q3.","Through FY 2018, as we continue to realize cost synergy benefits, we expect to be at the high-end of or exceed our EPS leverage goal of 200 to 400 basis points. While our operational performance remains strong, we recognize foreign currency translation is still a significant pressure to our bottom-line on a reported basis, as it is for most multi-national companies of our size and diversity.","We\u2019re attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs. We also continue to generate significant accessible free cash flow, which we are deploying with discipline, investing for our future, while at the same time allocating capital to reduce debt and provide strong returns for our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","In summary, our formula for long-term success is to deliver consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth, with 200 to 400 basis points of EPS leverage and return a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases.","The expected net result is creating enormous value with sustainable double-digit total shareholder returns.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the drivers of our revenue growth. As we have noted before, we have three growth priorities stemming from our overall strategies: new therapies, emerging markets, and services and solutions. With specific growth expectations for each, we continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals. In therapy innovation, we continue to see strong adoption of our new product and our pipeline remains robust.","Our new therapies\u2019 growth vector accounted for nearly two-thirds of our total company growth, contributing approximately 350 basis points, at the high-end of our goal of 150 to 350 basis points.","Based on our pipeline and product breadth, we believe performance in the upper-half of this range is sustainable over the long term. In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which grew 7%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important rapidly growing medtech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacements, MRI-safe implantable technology, AF ablation, predictive diagnostics and drug-coated balloons.","CVG has also seen a highly differentiated new products drive growth from its base businesses. In drug-eluting stents, our Resolute Onyx and Resolute Integrity stents are holding share despite major competitive launches. Our position in Europe has been strengthened further by the recent addition of new sizes and indications for Resolute Onyx.","In High Power, the Evera MRI ICD that we launched last fall resulted in improved pricing in the U.S. ICD market and a multiyear high share position. Looking ahead, we have a number of new products that will continue to differentiate us in the CVG market, and help protect and grow our leadership position. These include our MR-Conditional CRTD devices, which recently received FDA approval and are currently launching in the U.S. and Europe.","We also continue to make progress in bringing our Micra Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. and Japan. And we had a successful FDA advisory panel in this technology two weeks ago.","Our longer term CVG pipeline is also robust with potentially disruptive therapies like our Drug-Filled Stent, Intrepid Transcatheter Mitral Valve and Symplicity Spyral renal denervation system.","Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group grew 5%, with Surgical Solutions growing above market and PMR growing at market. Innovative technologies that advance and enhance minimally invasive surgery are driving strong above market growth.","Looking ahead, the majority of MITG\u2019s growth will come from five key growth drivers. Within Surgical Solutions open to Minimally Invasive Surgery or MIS, Gastrointestinal cancer and Lung cancer, and within PMR End-Stage Renal Disease and respiratory compromise. Of these the largest contributor to growth is expected to come from our open to MIS strategy, which is focused on sustainable long-term surgical market leadership by improving open surgery, transitioning open surgeries to MIS, and advancing MIS technologies.","Our recently created new business, Renal Care Solutions supplemented its breadth with the acquisition of Bellco last month. Bellco is a full line of therapies and systems for the treatment of renal failure. This combination of Bellco with our legacy renal access business and our internally developed portable dialysis system, offers a complete product solution for End-Stage Renal Disease.","With few of the global growth drivers that I just mentioned, MITG has a strong product portfolio and expects to launch more than 20 products through the end of fiscal year 2017, with approximately 75% in Surgical Solutions and approximately 25% in PMR.","These new offerings are expected to generate approximately $500 million in cumulative revenue over the next three years. Across MITG, we are developing solutions to expand the entire care continuum, aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster complication-free recovery, and enhanced patient outcomes through less invasive solutions.","In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 4%, we also have a number of new products driving growth. In Neurovascular, our Pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. Following the four clinical trials published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, the market continues to adopt our Solitaire mechanical thrombectomy device. A segment of the global ischemic stroke market that we think can triple in size by 2020.","In Surgical Technologies, we are seeing strong growth from our recently launched O-arm O2 Surgical Imaging System. In Spine, despite posting mid-single-digit growth in international Core Spine and double-digit growth in U.S. BMP, Q3 results came in below our expectations, primarily because of weakness in U.S. Core Spine.","We are focused on executing our turnaround plan in Spine. Our primary focus is growing our market share to what we are calling speed-to-scale product launches. Speed-to-Scale involves coming to market with a steady cadence for new products as a result of faster innovation cycles and launching these products of scale with sets available for the entire market.","These new products will also be combined with enabling technologies, biologics, and targeted physician training at the time of launch. The goal is to constantly innovate procedures such as OLIF and TLIF, and improve upon their outcomes.","We have several near-term launches, including accelerated ramps of Solera Voyager, and our ELEVATE expandable interbody device, both of which are expected to improve our share in TLIF procedures, an area where we\u2019ve been struggling. This quarter we will launch the Atlantis Essentials another Cervical Plate System, the first product in our Spine Essentials platform. Spine Essentials will bring efficiency to the most common spine fusion procedures through more streamlined pre-sterilized sets.","Additionally, we are further integrating the development roadmaps of our enabling technologies with our spine instrumentation, offering a differentiated surgical synergy experience for our customers. And finally, we intend to focus our efforts and gaining share in biografts, utilizing our broad biologics portfolio, including infuse.","We had challenges this quarter in our Neuromodulation division as well. While, we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused on resolving this matter, our drug pump revenue has been affected. We are also facing increased competition in Pain Stim, our recently approved MRI Surgical Lead is expected to help our competitive position in Pain Stim, as we are the first company to have a complete Spinal Cord Stimulation System approved for full-body MRI scans.","In addition, we continue to market the benefits of our differentiated AdaptiveStim and SureScan MRI technology. And more surgeons are adopting our AdaptiveStim HD High Density programming options. While we are focused on solving the issues in Spine and Neuromodulation, and our efforts in Spine are expected to result in steady improvement. Neuromodulation could be under some pressure for the next several quarters, resulting in overall RTG growth around the low-end of the mid-single-digit range.","In our Diabetes group, which grew 11%, we continue to see strong adoption of our MiniMed 640G System in the markets where it is available as well as strong demand for our MiniMed Connect, which is the only system providing a remote access to pump and sensor data on the users\u2019 smartphone.","We also continue to make an excellent progress in bringing the world\u2019s first hybrid closed-loop system the MiniMed 670G to market. We expect to complete enrollment in our pivotal trial in the next few weeks with PMA submission to the FDA targeted before the end of June.","Outside the U.S., we had strong Q3 performance. We were pleased by the positive guidance recently issued by NICE in the United Kingdom, which recommended the MiniMed Paradigm Veo as the only system for reducing the risk of potentially life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes.","In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapies business for Type 2, our partnership with Henry Schein is underway and we are already starting to see interest from primary care physicians for our iPro 2 Professional CGM system with Pattern Snapshot. In our Diabetes Services & Solutions business, we are preparing to bring our standalone CGM system, Guardian Connect, to market with the PMA submission in U.S. next week, as well as expected launch in Europe in early FY 2017.","This product will allow us to provide both Type 1 and Type 2 patients on multiple daily injections with a real-time glucose monitoring solution. When you combine our standalone CGM product with the applications and cognitive computing capabilities that we will bring through our partnership with IBM, we are well-positioned to provide patients with not just a sensor, but with a comprehensive diabetes management solution.","Overall, we are excited by the progress of our diabetes business and feel we are well-positioned for sustained growth.","Next, let\u2019s discuss our globalization strategy. In Q3, emerging markets grew 14% and contributed approximately 190 basis points for our Q3 total company growth, at the upper-end of our baseline goal of 150 to 200 basis points.","We have consistently delivered double-digit growth in emerging markets, despite the fact that several of these markets have faced macroeconomic pressures. This is a result of continued execution of our differentiated strategies in channel optimization, and in developing public and private partnerships.","We have also benefited from increased geographic diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency on any single market. In Q3, Middle East and Africa, Southeast Asia, India and Greater China, all grew in the mid to upper teens.","In China, we grew 14%, where our strong sales execution and expansion of our multiline selling presence into tier 2 and tier 3 markets is resulting in above market growth. We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy, which aims to transition our distribution partnerships to include consolidated logistics platform distributors.","We are also developing comprehensive partnerships with provincial governments, like that to the Chengdu Government in Sichuan Province, where we previously announced a partnership to manufacture our portable hemodialysis equipment. In Q3, we broadened our partnership with Chengdu, agreeing to manufacture our next generation diabetes pump technology in Chinese language for the local market in Sichuan, while working together with local authorities to expand access for this product.","China continues to represent a tremendous growth opportunity. Despite the complexities of this market we have shown that we can grow double-digits in China in sustained basis. We believe China will become our largest healthcare market over the long-term, serving more patients than doctors in any other country. And we can never lose sight of this potential.","In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 19%, driven by the joint venture we formed earlier this year with our largest Saudi distributor as part of our channel optimization strategy in the region. In Latin America, we grew 10%, including 7% growth in Brazil. While we continue to outperform the market in Brazil, we do see continued market volume weakness, resulting from public spending constraints, as well as some difficulty in getting inventory into the country because of customs holds.","Across the emerging markets, we\u2019re applying our standard market development activities, as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization, like in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, establishing government partnerships in Chengdu and developing private partnerships like the one we established with the Abraaj Group last quarter.","All of these initiatives have the ability to accelerate growth in these regions and lead to sustained market outperformance. We believe strongly that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in medtech over the long-term.","Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our Services and Solutions\u2019 growth vector contributed to approximately 20 basis points to Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points revenue growth, our revenue growth was in the mid-30s and contributed 50 basis points to CVG growth, where our efforts are most developed.","We expect to further improve our growth of Services and Solutions model and expand it across all our business groups. In Care Management Services, formerly known as Cardiocom, our growth rate was in the mid-20s in Q3, driven by strong performance within the U.S. Veterans Administration Healthcare System, where we are managing a cohort of over 85,000 patients with multiple co-morbidities.","Care Management Services represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in bundled payment models for different interventions.","In our Hospital Solutions business through which we provide expertise and operational efficiency as well as daily administrative management of hospital cath labs and operating rooms, we had service revenue growth rates in the mid-30s. Since the time we started this business a little over two years ago, we have now completed a total of 72 long-term managed service agreements with hospital systems, representing more than $1.7 billion in contracted service and product revenue over average span of six years.","While the majority of these hospitals are in Europe, we also have seven hospitals in Latin America and seven in the Middle East and Africa. We continue to attract strong customer interest in Hospital Solutions in regions around the world.","And we have a full pipeline of potential contracts. We are pleased with the progress we are making in expanding hospital solutions into operating rooms, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and associated expertise. We have signed five operating room managed services deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of seven years.","We are also expanding our solutions offerings into chronic disease management through Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinic and research center we acquired almost a year-ago. We continue to grow the number of contracted patients and expect to expand Diabeter beyond The Netherlands over time. Through initiatives like Diabeter as well as others that I mentioned earlier, we are transforming our diabetes group from a market-leading pump and sensor business into a holistic diabetes management business.","While all of these Services and Solutions, Care Management Services, Cath Lab and Operating Room Managed Services and Diabeter are still relatively early stage businesses, they are represent important future building blocks that we will use to create comprehensive value-based healthcare offerings, where payments will be based in measurable patient outcomes over a specific time horizon.","We are rapidly developing expertise in these areas with a particular focus in supporting bundled solutions across the care continuum targeting specific patient cohorts requiring a particular intervention. This is consistent with the direction of CMS\u2019s bundle payment initiative and their first implementation, Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement or CJR, which we fully support.","While this initiative is still evolving, it is one that is mandatory, consistent and measurable, which allows it to be scalable. We encourage CMS to expand bundled payments to other clinical areas, where we participate more broadly.","Healthcare is going through a necessary transformation, where stakeholders are seeking not only to improve clinical outcomes and expand access to care, but are also looking for solutions to optimize cost and efficiency. Our confidence continues to grow Medtronic\u2019s ability to lead and compete in these new value-based healthcare models around the world.","Our organization is exploring new and novel ways to not only deliver better clinical and economic value, but to tie our success to these outcomes through innovative new business models with providers and payors. We remain convinced that our technologies and services can play a central role to make the shift to value-based healthcare successful.","Turning now to the P&L, as I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage in Q3 of 1,150 basis points on a comparable constant currency basis, which significantly exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 basis points to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, as we deliver on our productivity improvements and cost synergy programs.","Operating leverage in the quarter was 510 basis points, driven predominantly by the improvement in SG&A, which is the line item with the majority of the Covidien integration cost synergy that we are realizing today are located. The remainder of our EPS leverage was driven by improvements in our interest expense and tax rate, as well as share repurchase activity.","Our strong revenue growth and operating leverage is generating significant adjusted free cash flow. In Q3, we generated $1.8 billion and expect to generate nearly $40 billion in adjusted free cash flow over the next five years.","We also continue to look for ways to un-trap cash in our balance sheet. Last September, we announced that we had un-trapped $9.3 billion of cash. And last month, we announced how we intend to use these proceeds. We\u2019re executing an incremental $5 billion share repurchase that we intend to complete by the end of FY 2018.","We intend to use the majority of the remaining proceeds to either prepay existing debt or pay debt that comes due by the end of fiscal year 2018 in order to meet our commitments to our debt investors.","We\u2019re deploying our capital with a balanced focus in M&A investments, meeting our debt reduction commitments and returns to shareholders. We are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we expect to deliver dependable long-term dividend growth.","Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25%, and we expect to grow or dividend faster than earnings, with intent to reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis even earlier than we had previously announced.","Regarding share repurchases, with incremental $5 billion share repurchase, we expect to return approximately $15 billion to shareholders over three years, more than double the amount we returned over the past three years. With our M&A investments we remain disciplined when evaluating potential opportunities.","Any investment we make must meet our portfolio criteria, which are: the targets must provide a line-of-sight to improving outcomes, allow for Medtronic to add value and we must have a team that is positioned to win. In addition, our investments must be aligned with and strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, meet our high financial return hurdles and minimize any near-term shareholder dilution.","Before turning the call over to Gary, I\u2019d like to conclude by commenting briefly on our Covidien integration activities, which continue to go extremely well. We\u2019re executing on our priorities to preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. We have preserved and in many cases accelerated the growth of both companies. Talent retention and employee satisfaction remain high as our two cultures continue to come together.","Our value capture programs are resulting in strong operating leverage. And we have meaningfully improved the sustainability of both our growth through the diversification of our revenue base and our capital allocation goals through the increased access to our cash.","In summary, Q3 was another quarter of solid execution by our organization. Our operating leverage is coming through as we expected and I\u2019m pleased with how we are positioning the company to deliver growth consistently and reliably.","Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our third quarter results. Gary?","Gary Ellis","Thanks, Omar. Third quarter revenue of $6.934 billion increased 61% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes $344 million of unfavorable impact of foreign currency.","Acquisitions and divestiture contributed a net 20 basis points to the Q3 revenue growth. Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share was a $1.06, a decrease of 1% versus the $1.07 delivered by legacy Medtronic last year, or an increase of 17% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.11 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation.","Q3 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.77, a decrease of 21%. In addition to the $374 million after-tax adjustment for amortization expense, this quarter\u2019s non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were a $43 million charge for acquisition-related items, a $16 million net restructuring charge and a $25 million benefit resulting from the establishment of a deferred tax asset related to the realization of a one-time capital loss.","Our Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company sales, grew revenue by 7%, with all three divisions growing at or above overall company growth. CRHF grew 6%, as we took significant share in a flat global implantables market. In High Power, our strong Evera MRI launch resulted in our highest U.S. High Power shares since early in the decade, despite the fact that we had declines in CRTD.","While CRTD business experienced sequential growth in U.S. implants share, we also had an intentional reduction in customer inventories ahead of our Q4 CRTD MRI launch. In Coronary, we are holding global diluted earnings - drug-eluting stent share in the face of major competitor data releases and product launches, which we attribute to increasing preference for the Resolute Onyx in Europe and our CVG multiline contracts in the U.S. In transcatheter valves, we grew in the low-30s consistent with the market.","Market share growth in Europe and the initial launch of CoreValve in Japan in the back half of Q3 balanced modest U.S. share loss, where our competitor product launch and a lack of having Evolut R in the largest valve segment limited total U.S. growth to the mid-20s. We were pleased to receive IDE approval for our U.S. low risk trial and it is worth noting that we now expect the global TAVR market will grow to approximately $4 billion by the end of 2020.","In Peripheral, we maintain drug-coated balloon market leadership globally and in the U.S. on the strength of our clinically differentiated impact IN.PACT Admiral balloon. Our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, which accounted for 33% of our total company sales, grew revenue 5%, with strong at or above market performance in both divisions. In Surgical Solutions, both Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy grew in the upper-single-digits, although we estimate that U.S. surgical volumes have normalized now at 1% to 2%.","The PMR division grew 1%, as the business was affected by a product hold of the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator, which resulted in an approximately negative $10 million to $15 million impact to the quarter. This is expected to affect quarterly PMR revenue by approximately $20 million to $25 million, until the product returns to the market, which is expected in the first-half of next fiscal year.","Our Restorative Therapies Group, which accounted for 25% of total company sales, grew revenue by 4% with strong growth in neurovascular and surgical technologies offsetting declines in Spine and in Neuromodulation.","In Spine, while U.S. Core Spine was challenged, we gain international Core Spine share. In BMP, the U.S. had strong low double-digit growth. However, the InductOs ship hold in Europe is expected to continue through mid-FY 2017.","In Neuromodulation, we recently received FDA approval for Parkinson\u2019s patients with early onset motor complications, expanding the number of potential patients that can be treated with DBS therapy.","Our Diabetes Group, which accounted for 7% of total company sales, grew revenue at 11%, with strong broad-based performance across all three divisions. In IIM, our Type 1 business, we are seeing very good growth driven by the MiniMed 640G. In NDT, our Type 2 business, while the revenue base is still small, we are seeing growth over 250% as we continue to drive our iPro 2 professional CGM solution and the new easy to interpret pattern snapshot report into primary care channel.","In DSS, our Diabetes Service & Solutions business, we saw high-single-digit growth driven by U.S. consumable sales, our Diabeter acquisition and continued strong adoption of our MiniMed Connect remote connectivity platform.","Now turning to the P&L, as I discussed the operating items, it is worth clarifying that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis unless I say otherwise.","The Q3 operating margin was 29.2%, this represent a 140 basis point improvement over the prior year, but this improvement was completely offset on a reported basis by a negative 140 basis point impact from foreign currency. The 140 basis point operating margin improvement, included a 140 basis point improvement in SG&A, offset by a 20 basis point decline in gross margin, a 10 basis point increase in R&D and a 20 basis point improvement in net other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of over 10% or operating leverage of approximately 510 basis points over revenue growth.","Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.5%, SG&A of 33.3% and R&D of 7.6%. Also included in our Q3 operating margin was net other expense of $9 million, which included net currency gains of $78 million, primarily from our earnings hedging program. It is worth noting that including these net gains was an unexpected $21 million expense resulting from a revaluation of the Argentine peso denominated assets, which devalued by approximately 30%.","Regarding our earnings hedging program, while we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange, a growing portion of our profits are un-hedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings. Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which include a \u20ac1.09 and \u00a5113, we expect Q4 net other expense to be in the range of $5 million expense to $15 million of income, which includes approximately $110 million in currency gain and no longer includes the U.S. medical device tax, which has been suspended.","We expect our Q4 operating margin to be in the range of 31% to 31.3% on an as reported basis, based on current exchange rates. This forecast implies an approximate 300 basis point improvement in our operating margin on a constant currency basis. Our value capture programs as a result of the Covidien integration remain on track. And we now expect to exceed our original FY 2016 savings goal of $300 million to $350 million. And continue to target a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY 2018.","Below the operating profit line, Q3 net interest expense was $176 million, in line with our forecast. Based on current rates we would expect Q4 net interest expense to be in the range of $205 million to $210 million. This is an increase over prior quarters as the execution of our incremental share repurchases results in reduced interest income.","At the end of Q3, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximately $17.3 billion in cash and investments, of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q3 was 14.3%, which was an improvement from our forecast due to the permanent extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit as well as operational tax adjustments. For Q4, we expect our non-GAAP normal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 16.5%.","In Q3, adjusted free cash flow was $1.8 billion, we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile. In Q3, we paid $534 million in dividends and repurchased $710 million of our ordinary shares.","As of the end of Q3, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 81 million shares. Third quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.422 billion shares. For FY 2016, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.427 billion shares, including approximately 1.419 billion shares in Q4.","Next, I would like to comment on our revenue outlook. We expect revenue growth for the fourth quarter of FY 2016 to be in the range of 5% to 5.5% on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our prior outlook of second-half revenue to be in the upper-half of our mid-single-digit baseline goal. This is solid revenue growth, especially when you consider the strong upper-single-digit growth we delivered in Q4 last year.","While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact of exchange rates were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our Q4 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $180 million to $220 million.","Turning to guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.36 to $4.40, which includes an expected $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","Next, I will like to provide some high-level framing comments on fiscal year 2017, while we intend to give our revenue outlook in earnings per share guidance per our normal practice on our Q4 call, here are some items to keep in mind as you think about our next fiscal year. First on revenue growth, while we are not formally providing our FY 2017 and revenue outlook, we believe it is reasonable to think about our revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range on a constant currency basis consistent with our baseline expectations.","However, keep in mind that we had an extra selling week in the first quarter of FY 2016. This will negatively affect our Q1 FY 2017 revenue growth rate by approximately 600 basis points and our full fiscal year revenue growth rate by approximately 150 basis points, and as a commensurate impact to earnings per share.","Regarding foreign exchange, given current rates, we expect $200 million negative impact in FY 2017 revenue and expected to negatively affect FY 2017 earnings per share by approximately $0.20 to $0.25, primarily from the loss of significant hedging gains we had in FY 2016, as well as continued pressure from un-hedged emerging market currencies.","Based on the operating leverage from our Covidien integration activities as well the financial leverage from share repurchases we expect to generate in FY 2017, we would expect constant currency earnings-per-share growth to be in double-digits to lower teens, after adjusting for the extra weak in FY 2016, which would exceed our baseline goal of generating 200 to 400 basis points of earnings per share leverage.","Before turning the call back to Omar, I would like to remind you that we plan to hold our Q4 earnings call on May 31. We also plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held in New York City. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Gary. And we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group; Bryan Hanson, President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group; Geoff Martha, President of Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us.","We want to try to get as many as people as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to only one question, and if necessary a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call. And operator, first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.","Michael Weinstein","Thank you, guys, and good morning. Let me start with a couple of items. So, Gary, probably the first question people will have is just the operating margin expansion this quarter wasn\u2019t - I think what people were hoping and maybe which you were thinking in the last quarter, can you just talk about how much of that was FX, which you touched on and any other comments just relative to the progression of the synergies from Covidien?","Gary Ellis","Yes, I mean, as we indicated, Mike, I mean, obviously we are getting a lot of leverage in the quarter, 1,150 basis points on the bottom line on a constant currency basis. And as I mentioned in my comments, 510 points on the operating margin line just of leverage there and 140 basis point improvement on an operating basis. Unfortunately, with foreign exchange, it has been a headwind all year, it\u2019s having a similar negative impact on the margin, and so we didn\u2019t get as much of improvement than you might see on an as reported basis just because of that.","So as we\u2019ve been doing all the year, where basically we are continuing to executing against our operating leverage plans and our cost takeout synergies that we have from the Covidien transaction, but as with many companies we are experiencing the foreign exchange that\u2019s mitigating or eliminating a lot of that benefit that we are - as we roll through that. We are trying to manage that the best we can, but clearly that\u2019s having a big impact.","The Covidien synergies, the integration costs were coming in right on plan. In fact, as I mentioned in my comments we\u2019re ahead of schedule and we\u2019re probably going - we clearly will exceed the $300 million and $350 million that we assumed in the current year. We are seeing a lot of leverage here in Q3 and as we indicated - and even in Q4 we\u2019ll continue to see improvement in that operating margin as a result of the synergy.","So we are right in line with things, but I agree with you, I think FX is kind of camouflaging some of the real benefits you are seeing from an operations perspective.","Michael Weinstein","And for FY 2017, the $0.20 to $0.25 that\u2019s - let\u2019s say, $0.05 to $0.10 more than maybe you were taking a month, month-and-a-half ago?","Gary Ellis","Yes. I mean, I think overall the gains are - we even said for the current quarter was like $100 million, and it is $100 million in Q4. So, I mean, we are generating almost $400 million in gains in the current year. Obviously, we are not hedged at these favorable rates next year, and as a result that\u2019s going to have a negative impact. I think it\u2019s a little bit higher than what we would have been expecting a month or two ago in emerging markets. Some of currencies in the emerging markets have continued to weaken and that\u2019s become a little bit greater part of the total.","But the biggest portion of the $0.20 to $0.25, the majority of that is just the hedging gains that we will not have in FY 2017 that we had in FY 2016.","Michael Weinstein","Right. And then last one, the CRTD inventory drawdown that you highlighted in the quarter, any estimate for how much that was, because obviously the ICD performance was a little bit weaker than this year was expecting?","Gary Ellis","Michael Coyle will take that.","Michael Coyle","Yes. It was in the range about $15 million to $20 million.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Mike. All right. Thank you, guys.","Gary Ellis","Thanks, Mike.","Michael Coyle","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions here, I guess, Omar, I think the hallmark the last several quarters of the business has been a significant strength in the U.S. This is sort of the first quarter in a couple where we\u2019re seeing U.S. performance is a little slower here in the third quarter versus the prior two or three quarters. It was pretty broad based. There were certain specific things you called out.","Is there anything broadly you\u2019d sort of comment on as it relates to the U.S. market performance in the quarter?","Omar Ishrak","Like I had mentioned in the last call, the three things that we look at in the U.S, one is one which we knew was going to slow things out a little bit was the anniversarying of the Affordable Care Act and that probably had a little bit of an impact. The overall procedure volumes based on the economy I think were more or less steady. I think in the Surgical Solutions maybe a slight drop in procedure volumes, but essentially it was steady. There was no economy related issues.","The third aspect was simply our new products. And like I said, these new products going to come and go on a quarter-by-quarter basis and in general we still had pretty strong performance from new therapies. But in prior quarters it was even stronger, given a larger kind of sort of synergy of different products coming in at the same time.","I think that\u2019s going to go float up and down and that I think is the main factor here in the change in the U.S. market. But I have to point out that our whole model is based on the diversification, because we can\u2019t depend on just one market. And as you saw this quarter, emerging markets picked up a little bit and essentially sort of offset the drop in our U.S. revenue. But I think overall from a market perspective, it\u2019s pretty steady.","David Lewis","Okay. And then, Omar for you and the broader team, I mean, obviously durable growth is what you\u2019re trying to drive people towards.","Omar Ishrak","Yes.","David Lewis","I think as of outside sphere over the next couple of quarters that your CRM performance is not sustainable, and obviously that\u2019s going to weigh on kind of relative growth the next couple of quarters. Maybe, either from like why is CRM growth sustainable. And I guess Omar or for the broader team, if you think about certain franchises whether it\u2019s Spine or PMR, what are the key franchises that start getting better as CRM performance begins to decelerate? Thanks so much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks. Mike you go first and then I\u2019ll kind of talk about it.","Michael Coyle","Yes, actually, we see the CRHF business is being one of the prime drivers of sort of the near-term catalyst for the business over the next couple of quarters. Obviously CRTD, MRI being launched now in the United States, but with the 3T kind of CRTD MRI in Europe we think that\u2019s going to be a big contributor.","We\u2019re going to continue to add expanded MRI capability in the standard ICD segment with Evera MRI 3T for Europe and that will follow on into the U.S. early next year. Visia AF is the single chamber offering in that space where we will be actually adding to sort of the free capability of the link diagnostics where a single chambered device were really the first device which can actually detect atrial fibrillation.","We have the Micra that we would expect to come in, in the first-half of next year in the pacing segment. And after the upcoming ACC meeting we\u2019re going to be releasing the data on the FIRE AND ICE trial, which is the first very large head-to-head comparison of CryoAblation technology to point-by-point ablation technology. Not mention in fact that we also have things like Core Valve coming into Japan and LINQ coming into Japan next year.","So we think there are plenty of catalysts to keep the business growing here over the next several quarters.","Omar Ishrak","Yeah. I think we\u2019re confident in our steady growth in CVG overall and certainly in CRM. But like you point out, our business model is based on diversification of variety of other products. And I think the two examples that you gave are pertinent. I think in PMR we started seeing acceleration, especially as the ventilator starts to sort of resolve the issues that we\u2019ve had and we expect that early next year, early next fiscal year.","And in Spine, I think, we try to lay out as much detail as possible our change in approach. And we like, Geoff had mentioned earlier, we expect to see results in Spine in steady improvement every quarter. So an overall balance is what we look for. And then we also have pretty good cadence in diabetes as well. But we\u2019re - Mike is pretty confident that we can keep our growth rate in CRM going at least to a large degree.","Ryan Weispfenning","Great. Thanks, David. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you and good morning, everybody. Omar, can you maybe come back to Spine for a second? It\u2019s obviously a business where there\u2019ve been several iterations of sort of a turnaround plan over the past, call it years. So I think at the analyst meeting right before announcing the Covidien acquisition you were talking about the opportunity for cross-selling within RTG, now you\u2019re talking a little bit about ramping up the product cadence.","What signpost are you watching to identify whether you have the right strategy in Spine? How long are you willing to continue to let this business underperform?","Omar Ishrak","Well obviously, underperformance is not acceptable. The thing is that market is still a very attractive market for us and we\u2019ve got core expertise. So we\u2019re going to get this thing fixed. And then, I completely take your point. We laid out these strategies earlier. We haven\u2019t talked about the new product in as much as depth, we talked about in general terms. But as we start to dig into it under Geoff\u2019s leadership, we found that the way in which we were launching these products was just completely sub-optimal, which was really kind of almost compromising the value of these products.","And the overall cross-RTG synergies, what was missing before as we just end on specific targets on this. That\u2019s why we made the changes. We\u2019ve made changes in the field-level. We\u2019ve made changes in the overall leadership level. And we are looking at this thing closely on a quarter-by-quarter basis and we expect to see improvement.","The real guideline here is U.S. Core Spine, and the correlation of the product launches to an uptick in performance. I think it\u2019s as straight forward as that. That\u2019s the benchmark that we are looking at. That\u2019s the benchmark that you should look at. And we\u2019re going to get this thing fixed and because - again, like I said, we are in a position of high share. We are in a position where we\u2019ve got the biggest breadth with our customers. We\u2019ve got to this thing right.","So that\u2019s the portion we are taking and those are the guidepost I suggest that we look at - we\u2019ll point out and you should look at.","David Roman","Okay. And then, maybe for Gary, I know a lot of moving parts here around currency, synergy capture et cetera. Can you maybe just help us again - I\u2019m sorry, frame the impact that of the medical device tax suspension with currency hedging losses and how that all kind of ties into your comments around FY 2017, because I would have thought that the positive impact from the device tax suspension would at least give you some relief on currency and hedging losses? So can you maybe just walk us through the different moving parts there again?","Gary Ellis","Yes. Well, I mean, again, we are not obviously giving the FY 2017 guidance. And so, I don\u2019t want to get too much into what\u2019s going on there. We try to give some highlights of some things just to consider as you go through the model. But the point is, as we try to highlight here, I mean, for the current year as we go forward, we are continuing to expect the revenue growth to be in that mid-single-digit range as we go forward.","We are expecting we are going to continue to get the operating synergies and be at the high-end of the - or in fact exceed probably the earnings growth that we\u2019ve been expecting from the value capture of the Covidien transaction. And that\u2019s going just as we expected. It\u2019s coming in, in fact a little bit of ahead of the schedule at this point. And so we feel confident that will be positive as we go into the next fiscal year, obviously.","Foreign exchange continues to be a major headwind for us as it is with the many multinational companies and ours because of the hedging programs we did. If anything - if you think about it from foreign exchange, we had a $0.45 to $0.50 impact from the current year, but that was with significant gains that we had from our hedging programs.","So our impact was somewhat muted from maybe where other companies who don\u2019t hedge were at. That is going to come to ahead for us in FY 2017. And as we indicate, that\u2019s potentially another $0.20 to $0.25 of impact as we go into next year.","You\u2019re right; we are going to have some benefit from the medical device tax. We are getting some already in the current year that\u2019s helping give us even more operating leverage than what we were expecting previously. But again, the foreign exchange is kind of offsetting that as we kind of drive through this.","And so there is positives from the medical device fact. There is going to be positives from our share repurchase. All those are factor we have taken in consideration. But I think if you weight all those together, I think you\u2019re going to find that they play out like we\u2019ve indicated in our comments, because - but the issue as foreign exchange is clearly still a significant headwind for us.","And then, we obviously have a tough comparison next year in FY 2017, because of the extra week we had in the current year.","Those are all the factors that we try to lay out for you as you put together your models and we\u2019ll probably obviously provide more details and more guidance as we get to our Q4 call.","David Roman","Okay.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, David. We will take the next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.","Robert Hopkins","Hi, thanks and good morning. So just to follow-up on that, so two questions, one for Gary, I think you said in the prepared comments that while you are not giving guidance for 2017, your directional thought on earnings on a constant currency basis was low-double-digit to low-teens, and that\u2013 but that excluded the $0.20 to $0.25, and that also excluded the negative impact of the extra week, is that right? Is that what you said?","Gary Ellis","That\u2019s correct. I mean, Bob, what do we indicated was that - you are getting it to low-double-digits, mid-teens, what it would be, if you take out the impact for the extra week and obviously impact of foreign exchange. It was obviously you\u2019re going to be there. So I\u2019m not trying to minimize those.","We think even with the extra week, it depends on how you look at. You are probably still, probably close to double-digit growth on the operating earnings even with the extra week in there. But without it you\u2019re back to that lower double-digits, mid-teens is kind of the expectation. But foreign exchange of $0.20, $0.25 will obviously bring that down somewhat as we go forward. So that\u2019s our expectations as we look for FY 2017 as far as the existing models. Now again, we\u2019re not giving any guidance, but maybe just ran through what we provided on those key attributes that\u2019s what you would see in your models.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. So then directionally again on a reported basis for earnings that gets you to the high-single-digits depending on what ends up happening with the medical device tax, how much reinvests are down.","Gary Ellis","That\u2019s right.","Robert Hopkins","Okay. So then, thank you for that. And then, just to follow-up on one another thing for maybe for Omar or for Mike Coyle, on the High Power side, can you give us a sense as to what you expect for market growth as we look forward?","And I\u2019m just curious, did we see the same inventory drawdown when you launched your traditional ICD MRI-safe? I don\u2019t recall that. But I just would love to get a quick history lesson. Thanks.","Omar Ishrak","Go ahead, Mike.","Michael Coyle","No, we didn\u2019t do a drawdown in advance of that. And actually we wound up delaying the launch for a few weeks to allow that to occur. So that\u2019s what caused us to decide in this case to go ahead and do the inventory drawdown during the quarter.","In terms of the overall growth of the market, as we said, we think the overall implantables market was relatively flat during the quarter. I\u2019d point out two things to keep in mind. One is one of our competitors had an extra few days of extra week in their prior year quarter which is causing the market to look like it\u2019s slower than perhaps it actually is, in addition to the fact that we had this drawdown that I just referenced.","So if you had to correct for those items, we think the overall market was relatively flat with Low Power growing in low-single-digits and High Power basically declining in the low-single-digits. But we had both the - now a nice share capture, but also price improvements in the standard ICD segment tied to MRI. We would expect to see a similar dynamic play out in the CRTD segment which, of course, is larger. So I think that\u2019ll probably give you the best view of what we think is going to happen going forward.","Robert Hopkins","Great. Thank you very much.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Bob. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS.","Matt Miksic","Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Omar Ishrak","Yes, we can.","Matt Miksic","So I just wanted to follow up on the numbers that you gave for your outlook, long-term outlook for the TAVR market, and obviously coming in just to touch below what one of your competitors has come in would have been, and maybe a touch below some of the comments that you talked about halfway to $5 billion I think was your language over the past couple of months.","Not to make too much of that, but we would love to get a sense of how you feel about the market developing or what if anything we should read into those differences.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. I\u2019ll let Mike answer that. Go ahead, Mike.","Michael Coyle","Well, first let me correct, we never said that we thought the TAVR market was going to be $5 billion. In fact, I think, the last update we gave prior to today would have been around the $3.5 billion market around 2020, 2021. So I\u2019m not quite sure where that comment came from.","In terms of overall growth in the quarter, we were quite pleased in fact that we essentially grew with the market in the low-30% range for transcatheter valves. Obviously, that market growth is quite robust above the range of estimate that we had given previously of 25% to 30% for FY 2016.","And in addition, given the fact that we had a major competitive launch into United States during the quarter, we were actually quite pleased that our global transcatheter valve business is essentially splitting the market in terms of the growth rate growing with the overall market.","In terms of sort of guidance to a potential $4 billion market that was included in the commentary today, there are number of moving pieces here. Obviously, we\u2019ve not seen relative to the intermediate risk group committees [ph] to be not inferior or superior. We obviously are just getting started with the low-risk group so we\u2019re basically have sort of error bars, if you will, around the range. It\u2019s probably between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in terms of 2021 kind of timeframe.","And that\u2019s where we sort of landed in the middle on the $4 billion, but I think that will give you sense of at least how we\u2019re thinking about it today. And obviously, that will evolve as data gets presented on the performance in these patient cohorts.","Matt Miksic","Sure. That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you, Mike. And just, Omar, just to clarify your comments on the ACA and the volume trends that\u2019s sort of annualizing the ACA, is it fair to say, same much of that volume that you\u2019re seeing is in the MITG space that it was sort of a pull ahead and sort of equalizing this year or is that something you\u2019re seeing more broadly across your businesses?","Omar Ishrak","No. It is primarily MITG, and maybe, Bryan, you want some color on that, go ahead.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. I was very clear too, because we saw an increase for four quarters, exactly. And two quarters ago that ended. We saw basically the U.S. volumes go up to about 4% growth and now they\u2019ve come down to about 2%, they were 3% to 4% during that fourth quarter period. And they\u2019re 1% to 2% now. So we definitely saw an increase and a drop off as those annualized, but it\u2019s specific\u2026","Omar Ishrak","And then, stable at that level.","Bryan Hanson","Yes. It\u2019s not like we are declining, we\u2019re just not growing as fast as we were during that four quarter period.","Matt Miksic","Got it. Helpful, thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Matt.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, Bryan, if you could give an update on just the overall MIT Group and just any new products that we should be looking for or any highlights, I guess, as we are heading into the SAGES meeting?","Omar Ishrak","Go ahead, yes, go ahead, Bryan.","Bryan Hanson","Yes, sure. So generally speaking, I\u2019d just say, if you look at MITG, everything is going well. I\u2019ll pull back and just talk about that for a second then I\u2019ll get into the products and health business. But we do on a monthly basis an employee engagement survey, just to kind of check the pulse of the organization as we are going through the integration. And I\u2019m happy to say that those results come back very positive. As a matter of fact, within MITG the scores are slightly higher, even in legacy Medtronic.","And so being acquired and having the number of changes that are occurring in our business and still having those scores come back in engagement perspective that high, gives me confidence that we are going to have the retention of key talent, which we\u2019re working very hard to do and we are going to continue our momentum. So I think that\u2019s probably first and foremost in my opinion is the most important thing.","Second to that, at SAGES you\u2019re going to see a number of nice things coming from our surgical business. I referenced in the prepared document that we have greater than 20 products across MITG being launched that will drive close a $0.5 billion in revenue over the next three years or so. So we have a very healthy portfolio of products. Just a couple that I\u2019ll call out that you\u2019ll see again in SAGES would be new generators that we have in our advanced energy line.","One of them would be a next generation ForceTriad generator that will focus on better speed to seal and also provide the capability to drive new LigaSure instruments. That\u2019s the most important thing about the generator. It will give us the capability to drive instruments that will be a little more unique in the marketplace. I\u2019ll talk about one of those in a second.","We also have a generator that we are launching that is specifically for emerging markets. That\u2019d take that same capability in LigaSure and provide a lower cost generator so we can get access to those markets as well. That actually launched a quarter ago. And then, one of the new instruments that I mentioned in Energy will be a multi-function device.","And this is important, because what you are looking for the perfect world in Advanced Energy is to be able to divide tissue to scelvenize [ph] either organs or vessels that you\u2019re trying to take. And you want to do that typically with a product that divides well or cuts well. But at the same point, you would like to use that instrument for sealing.","And that\u2019s one of these products we\u2019re going to be launching and talking about at SAGES will do both of those very well. This has been elusive for everybody in the marketplace to get it down. We think we figured it out. We are going to talk about that in SAGES.","And then, we have a couple of items in Stapling. We\u2019ve got our next generation powered Stapling that\u2019s coming. We\u2019re getting great reviews from customers. And again, most important thing about the powered stapling is it is the driver for our end effectors and with utilizing Tri-Staple Technology.","So those are just a few things coming in the short-term. And then, of course, in the mid-term we talk about our robotics platform. We will give you a little more insight in SAGES. I want to be cautious to give you any specifics on when we are going to launch, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s in the mid-term and we\u2019re excited about that project as well.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, great. And then, just for you, Geoff, just as you\u2019ve been now Head of the RTG Group that business had obviously some pluses and minuses. You saw some really good growth across the Neurovascular business. It\u2019s obviously legacy Covidien unit and then some weakness still amongst the Spine business.","How quickly do you think that it will take to really term, I guess, the franchises around - clearly, we\u2019re seeing kind of the turn within R&D functions within the Cardio Vascular Group? What are some of the different things that you are doing within Spine? Are you wrapping some of the solutions around it or what\u2019s kind of the approach in change of the, I guess, strategy within RTG?","Geoffrey Martha","Sure. Well, thanks, Kristen. First of all, on the businesses like Neurovascular, and particular in our Surgical Technologies business, the ENT business, Advanced Energy business, we want to ensure those continue to perform. And we feel very good about where they stand in terms of their new product launches and the new clinical data that they will have coming out, so very excited about that, and obviously a lot of questions even on this call regarding Spine.","That\u2019s a multi kind of fully \u2013first to answer the turn around there, we have been having steady quarter-over-quarter growth over the last couple of quarters. This quarter was a little bit of step back in the U.S. And we anticipate returning to growth next quarter and a continued to steady cadence of improvement.","And it\u2019s really, there is a couple of things, one, as Omar mentioned, our Core Spine portfolio. We are excited about the products. Our upstream marketing guys have done a good job, building a number of new products. And now we are focused on the downstream commercial execution, and the launch of those products. And just this quarter we have several new ones for lumbar fusion, this VOYAGER fixation system and Elevate Expandable Cage.","And the one that I am particularly really excited about is this OLIF procedure, which we think based on the physician feedback we are getting, is going to fairly disruptive to the space.","And so, we have a number of those new product launches. And the big change is launching them at scale. So making sure we have the right amount of assets and inventory to launch them at scale, which is a change. The other component here is our biologic portfolio, which infuse is the biggest piece. That continues to rebound and we continue to get - we just got a recent new indication for that OLIF procedure I just mentioned. And we\u2019re working on other indications there for infuse and then our broader biologics portfolio.","And then finally, Omar already mentioned surgical synergy. A little bit of a more nuanced view on this one. First of all, when people look at our overall RTG performance, the spine business dramatically helps our surgical technology business. Our navigation - that business has been about a high-single-digit, low-double-digit growth platform for the last couple of years, powered by navigation and the imaging platforms.","Without Spine we wouldn\u2019t have that type of growth, full-stop. But what we need to do is move further upstream and have a tighter technology integration between those two units so that our customers feel a differentiated surgical synergy experience.","And then, finally, we are hiring what we are calling ETC reps, these are Enabling Technology Consultants, that are really driving the penetration on the ground with the physicians for navigated spine procedure. So it\u2019s a number of different things. And, look, this is going to be a steady climb back. And we are pretty excited about the next two quarters actually regarding Spine.","And then, getting back to overall RTG, there is a place that we have the - I think the most weakness actually in the Spine, because it\u2019s moving, is Neuromodulation. Our weakness in Pain stim and pain pumps, partially driven by the consent decree for pumps and a competition for stim, that\u2019s offsetting our growth in DBS and Neuro. And that\u2019s going to take a few quarters to work through those dynamics.","Kristen Stewart","Okay. Thanks very much.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks, Kristen. We\u2019ll take questions from two more people, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe\u2026","Omar Ishrak","Can you speak up a little bit, Vijay? We can\u2019t hear you\u2026","Vijay Kumar","Hey, guys, can you hear me now?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. That\u2019s better.","Vijay Kumar","Can you hear me now?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. We can. Go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Okay. Maybe one quick on the guidance, right, I think when Gary mentioned sort for low-teens EPS growth for next year, and if you offset that by 1.5% from XOV [ph] and the $0.20 to $0.25 from FX hedging gains, I just want to make sure that that low-teens EPS growth, is that assumed [indiscernible]?","Gary Ellis","I think, I caught most of it. You were breaking up a little bit as you went through it. But I mean, again, I want to make sure we\u2019re clear, we are not giving guidance for FY 2017 yet. And we just try to put some items out there for you to think about it as we\u2019re going forward. So I am not going to get specific about what we\u2019ve assumed for share buybacks et cetera, because, obviously, we are not giving guidance, yet.","But as we were trying to highlight in our comments, obviously, the revenue growth we would expect to continue in the mid-single-digit revenue range as we talked about. Clearly, we are going to get a significant operating leverage improvement from the earning standpoint on a constant currency basis, because of the value capture we are taking out, because of the medical device tax benefit and how much of that\u2019s reinvested, not reinvested, will come into play as we go through that whole discussion.","Obviously, as you indicated, there will be share buyback benefits that will be reflected in most numbers. And that\u2019s why we indicated that on a constant currency basis, we would expect that we\u2019re going to be in the low-double-digit to mid-teens earnings per share growth on a constant currency basis. We just take all those factors into consideration, that\u2019s after you take out the extra week of your just comparing apples-to-apples.","And as a result of that - then you have the FX impact coming in place. So all we are trying to highlight to people, as your assumptions going forward on our leverage assumptions et cetera are consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing, but just remember, FX has not went away and just remember that we had an extra week in the current year.","So other than that, I don\u2019t want to give you more on the guidance aspect. We\u2019ll provide more details as we put together our guidance in the Q4 call.","Vijay Kumar","That was helpful, Gary, and maybe one for Omar. Omar, I know that you spoke about funneling in the service offering, right. And part of it was expanding the Covidien\u2019s surgical offerings in EM. And I\u2019m wondering if you could provide us any sort of an update on how it\u2019s tracking either in Europe or in active markets within Europe.","Omar Ishrak","Actually, it\u2019s striking very well. This is the moving the Cath Lab Managed Services model to the operating room. And like I mentioned before, really I got five contracts in place operating in Europe today, with contracted revenue of\u2026","Gary Ellis","$140 million.","Omar Ishrak","$140 million already from both devices and services, so that\u2019s the - I think the pickup is about equivalent to what we\u2019d experience with Cath Lab Managed Services about four or five quarter we expect to see; maybe accelerate that little more as we go into more geographies more quickly. But we are quite pleased with the progress there. And then we\u2019re developing good expertise in that area.","Ryan Weispfenning","Okay. Thanks, Vijay. We\u2019ll take our final question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.","Raj Denhoy","Hi, good morning. Gary, I hate to come back to this. But I wanted to get to the operating margin question again. And really the reported number was just slightly below the guidance you gave of 28% to 28.5% last quarter. And I understand currency had an impact, but you did also give us currency guidance, which was - and you did come in line with that. So I guess, I\u2019m curious, what the disconnect was between what you actually did in currency and what you thought the impact would be on the quarter.","Gary Ellis","Yes, well, I think, overall, we gave currency guidance from the standpoint of revenue, which did come in line with what we had expected. But I think where currency was a little bit greater was on the bottom line and it\u2019s primarily because of the Argentine peso that I mentioned earlier, that that cost us an unexpected a little over $20 million, $21 million impact that we had not expected in the guidance that we provided back in the Q2 call.","So that was the primary thing now. So FX was a bigger negative on the bottom line in the quarter, that what we had originally expected at the beginning of the quarter. As you indicated, the revenue was right in line, but the bottom line was a larger impact. So from an operating margin perspective, we came in with basically where we expected originally, but it was little bit more offset on the bottom line from FX than what we had originally expected.","Raj Denhoy","And so, when we think about - you gave us guidance also for the fourth quarter here of 31% to 31.3% on operating margins. How do again do we get comfortable - and I hate splitting hair, because I realize there\u2019s only 20 basis points or so. But given that it\u2019s sort of the marker that investors are using for the integration of Covidien, how do we get comfortable that we won\u2019t again see perhaps an outsize impact on currency or is it just simply the nature of the beast here?","Gary Ellis","Again, I wish, I could predict currency and be able to tell you that there is not going to be surprises to positive or negative on the currency side. So I mean, currency is what it is, I mean, though that the impact will be as we go forward. Again, we were trying to give guidance on - as you said, I mean, 20 basis points, trying to call that in our operating margin line with all the moving parts there going on is not easy. So we understand there are lots of moving parts here.","Currency was negative in the quarter. I\u2019m not expecting another devaluation here in Q4. But if it happens in one of the currencies that could be a little bit of a negative. On the other hand, what we\u2019ve tried to provide as far as guidance on what we expect based on what we know right now and based on the current rates and where things are at, that gives the guidance on the operating margins.","So we feel confident about that, assuming, again, that there are no surprises positive or negative. So that\u2019s all the best we can do at this point in time, just to give you some indication on which direction these things are going.","Raj Denhoy","No, that\u2019s helpful.","Gary Ellis","But let me just add one comment. The key element I want to make clear is the thing that we can control. The cost take-out of the synergies that we\u2019re getting from the standpoint of the Covidien transaction and the leverage we\u2019re getting across to rest of the organization, that\u2019s the piece that we can control and that is going right as expected. It\u2019s in fact ahead of our plans, as I mentioned there in our previous comments. So the piece that we can control, we are delivering on as expected.","Raj Denhoy","No, that\u2019s clear. Thank you.","Operator","That was our final\u2026","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Go ahead - anymore, shall we close now, Ryan, go ahead.","Ryan Weispfenning","Yes, let\u2019s close, Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Listen, first of all, I just want to also reemphasize what Gary just said. As I\u2019ve said, ever since I started here, we can work on things that we can control. What we accept other variables and we try to understand completely, the valuation of the company is based on the actual performance. We can only kind of drive what we can control as best we can, meet our commitments and drive it aggressively as we can. And that we are completely committed to doing.","And on that basis, as Gary just pointed out, the cost synergies that we expect from Covidien, we\u2019ve got pretty granular look at that. We\u2019re delivering. We\u2019re delivering, this operating team is delivering and they\u2019re stretching hard and then trying to cover for other things. But there is only so far we can go about things that are not in our control.","So I just do want to make that point that we haven\u2019t lost our operational focus on delivering these synergies one bit and in many ways are a little bit ahead of our original commitments. But there are lots of moving parts there. And then, we are optimistic about the future and our plans are pretty solid going into fourth quarter and into next year.","But let me go back to the long-term and really conclude by noting that our overall long-term financial model. And let me remind you what it is. It\u2019s consistent mid-single-digit constant currency revenue growth on a reliable basis, which we will get through the diversification of our businesses as well as geographies and our new product cadence. 200 to 400 basis points of constant currency EPS leverage over the long-term and some of that may be a little higher in the next couple of years, as we realize all the synergies from the Covidien acquisition as we saw this quarter.","And then, finally returning a minimum of 50% of our adjusted free cash flow to our shareholders, that again is a commitment that we are completely living up to and we expect to see that fulfilled in the upcoming quarters.","Stepping back, further look - this company is geared around fulfilling our mission, of alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life, and that mission continues. We are confident that this team can execute consistently, balancing our trade-offs and offsetting pressures and in the end we\u2019re committed to creating long-term dependable value in healthcare.","With that and behalf of the entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q4 call on May 31. Thank you and have a great day, everyone. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator instructions.] Mr. Jeff Warren, VP of investor relations, you may begin your conference, sir. ","Jeff Warren","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic\u2019s second quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic\u2019s chief financial officer; will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2014 second quarter, which ended October 25, 2013. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. ","Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.","In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com. Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter and full year 2013, and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic chairman and chief executive officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning, and thank you, Jeff. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported second quarter revenue of $4.2 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, both representing growth of 3%.","Our Q2 revenue growth was in line with our outlook for the year, and we are performing at or better than the market in almost every one of our business lines. Q2 also represents another quarter where our overall organization delivered balanced growth with strong performances in some areas offsetting challenges in other parts of our business.","Looking ahead, we are confident that our three primary strategies: therapy, innovation, and globalization in economic value will position us well to thrive in the transforming healthcare environment. ","This quarter, we made significant progress on a number of new therapy growth drivers that we intend to launch over the coming quarters. These, combined with our continued focus on globalization and economic value, will not only help us improve our competitive position and overall growth profile but will also further strengthen and geographically diversify our business, allowing us to reliably deliver consistent growth.","As you will recall, in Q1 I discussed the three specific challenges that negatively affected our growth and that we believed would improve going forward: U.S. diabetes, U.S. PAINSTIM, and U.S. ICDs. I am pleased to report that we have made significant progress in all three businesses. ","First, in the U.S. diabetes, we received FDA approval in late September for our MiniMed 530G system, several months earlier than we estimated in August. Our diabetes team executed well, ramping up manufacturing in a short period of time to start shipping in mid-October.","While we are still somewhat supply constrained as we transition our full manufacturing to Puerto Rico, early signs are that the 530G system is going to be a big success in the market, and we expect our U.S. diabetes business to grow in the mid-teens and contribute approximately 100 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in the back half of the fiscal year. ","Second, in U.S. PAINSTIM, you will recall that we received FDA approval for our innovative MRI SureScan spinal cord stimulator much earlier than expected. While this resulted in the supply constraints last quarter, and for the first two months of Q2, our neuro team diligently worked through these issues and is now executing the full product launch. ","The early response from the market is impressive. U.S. PAINSTIM grew in the mid-teens in the final month of the quarter and we expect this level of growth to continue, contributing roughly 40 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in the second half of the year.","Third, in U.S. ICD, you will recall that our Q1 results were affected by lower levels of wholesales because of the [phase in] timing of our new high powered products, which, as you anticipated, resolved itself in Q2. Customers continue to adopt our latest generation devices, Viva and Evera, helping us, by our estimation, to gain share sequentially.","Equally important, our ICD prices, which has been down in the low to mid single digits for several quarters, was actually flat in Q2, based on the strength of our latest generation devices. In addition to these improved performances, surgical technologies delivered another outstanding quarter, growing 11%.","All three of these businesses, ENT, neurosurgery, and advanced energy, continue to execute and deliver solid growth. In particular, I\u2019d like to recognize advanced energy, which grew over 20% again this quarter. ","This is becoming a very important business for us, with cross-selling opportunities in spine, ortho, and CRDM. Advanced energy was formed from the first two acquisitions at the beginning of my tenure as CEO, and the business has been delivering strong double-digit growth in the five consecutive quarters since the first anniversary of these acquisitions. These results illustrate that when we combine diligent strategic rationale, strong integration plans, and solid execution, we can generate significant returns on investment. ","In Q2, our organization delivered on the bottom line, despite multiple pressures. The most significant departure from expectations was in our gross margin. It is important to note, though, that pricing was in line with expectations and did not affect our Q2 gross margin performance. ","Instead, we can point to three distinct issues. First, FX pressure negatively affected the gross margin by 50 basis points. Second, the manufacturing ramp of a number of new products caused higher levels of scrap and obsolescence, which had a negative impact of 20 basis points. And third, as we mentioned last quarter, we aggressively continued to reallocate engineering resources to promptly and comprehensively address the specific quality issues outlined in our neuromodulation and diabetes warning letters. ","This resulted in a shift of spending from R&D to cost of goods sold, thereby negatively affecting our Q2 gross margin by 40 basis points. While diverting these resources is costly, ensuring the highest level of quality and regulatory compliance has, and always will be, a personal priority for me and the central focus of everything that we do at Medtronic.","In the first half of our fiscal year, we generated over $1.8 billion of free cash flow, and over the next five years, we expect to generate over $25 billion of free cash flow. Our organization remains focused on improving our already robust levels of free cash flow generation. For example, we continue to make progress on our working capital improvement program, with the goal of increasing our inventory turns by 50% by FY17.","We\u2019re committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, a commitment level we believe is appropriate given our current mix of U.S. and international free cash flow. As you know, this mix continues to be constrained by U.S. tax policy, which creates a negative incentive for us to repatriate cash to the U.S. ","The remaining 50% gives us the flexibility to make the necessary investments for sustainable growth. We continue to be very disciplined in how we deploy our capital, with a strong focus on returns. Our potential M&A transactions must not only be strategically aligned, but they must also stand up to the high standards of growth, surpassing our mid-teens risk-adjusted hurdle rate, as well as minimizing the diluted impact of shareholder EPS growth expectations.","As we look ahead, we not only have a number of near and mid-term growth opportunities, but we also have some challenges to overcome. First, in Japan, our team has done an incredible job guiding growth over the past four quarters and the strength of product launches in our cardiac ambassador group. ","However, we will now be facing a period of difficult year over year comparisons from these product launches, as well as the biennial [unintelligible] zone pricing adjustments that are anticipated to go into effect in April. As a result, Japan, which contributed significantly to our total company growth in the first half of fiscal year is now expected to have closer to flat growth in the second half.","Next, our BMC business continues to be challenged, in Q2, this business declined 17%, which is worse than we were expecting. We continue to stand behind this product based on its safety and efficacy profile and improved limitations. However, the product remains under pressure as some surgeons continue the reduce the usage through both patient selection and the use of smaller kits.","We continue to analyze the key drivers behind the customer purchasing decisions, post [unintelligible], and we are urgently examining initiatives to optimize the strengths of BMP in both the U.S. and international markets. However, given that BMC has yet to show signs of stabilization, if current revenue trends continue for the remainder of the fiscal year, BMC revenue would decline in the midteens for FY14, similar to the decline we experienced in FY13.","Finally, our emerging market growth in Q2 was 13%. While this performance is respectable, and these markets continue to contribute a large portion of our overall company growth, our overall results this quarter were well short of our targeted levels. Across our emerging market regions, there have been a number of region-specific challenges, including product registration issues and distributor conversions, which have held back our growth. ","We experienced overall slower growth this quarter, with the largest sequential slowing occurring in Greater China and Central and Eastern Europe. In Greater China, our results were affected by the phase-in of new CRDM products, the discontinuation of the distributor relationship in CBG, and slower overall markets in CRDM in orthopedics.","In Central and Eastern Europe, this has been tracking above 20% in eight of the last nine quarters. Growth was in the midteens in Q2, primarily due to Russia, where slowing GDP growth, along with some major fiscal funding constraints, are negatively affecting healthcare budgets. ","Looking at emerging markets in total, I realize that over the past few quarters our growth rates have modestly slowed. However, the fundamental demand in the end markets remains strong, and we have several initiatives in place to capitalize on these opportunities. We remain confident that growth rates will improve and that emerging markets represent a significant long term opportunity.","As we look into the future, we\u2019re convinced that our three strategic priorities: therapy innovation, globalization, and economic value, will position us well to thrive in the transforming healthcare environment. I\u2019d like to update you on each of these strategies.","Starting with therapy innovation, it is important to note that Medtronic\u2019s ability to create innovative therapies and new markets is fundamental to our overall growth strategy. It is a strategy that is deeply rooted in our culture, one that we\u2019re extremely proud of, and an area where we have a proven track record of executing.","As we look ahead, we\u2019re on the verge of bringing a number of new therapies to market over the coming quarters. In addition to our recently launched Viva CRT-D, Evera ICD, and Advisa MRI pacemaker products, the CRDM business intends to launch the Reveal Linq in Q4. This is our next generation implantable loop recorder, which will further expand our footprint upstream in cardiac diagnostics.","In spine, we continue to work with the FDA to bring our next generation cervical disc, the [unintelligible], to the U.S. market. And we expect to follow that launch with a series of cervical plate launches in FY15. ","In neuromodulation, the PAINSTIM business will build upon the U.S. launch of the RestoreSensor MRI by continuing its global rollout with the Q3 launch in Japan. In surgical technologies, we are developing a full pipeline of new power imaging and navigation equipment that improve the economic value proposition for hospitals.","In diabetes, in addition to the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system with the ","Enlite sensor, our next-generation insulin pump system, the MiniMed 640G, remains on track for launch by the end of the fiscal year.","And finally, we\u2019re making excellent progress on three fundamentally new therapy areas that meaningfully impact our outlook for FY15 and beyond: our CoreValve transcatheter aortic valve, our Symplicity Flex renal denervation system for treatment resistant hypertension, and our IN.PACT drug eluting balloon. All three of these products are market leaders in Europe, and we are planning to launch all of them in the U.S. over the coming quarters.","CoreValve for extreme risk patients is now expected to launch late this fiscal year, CoreValve for high risk patients in mid-FY15, Symplicity Flex in late FY15, and IN.PACT Admiral in early FY16. ","Suffice it to say, we have set ourselves up to deliver what is arguably one of the strongest launch [unintelligible] of innovative therapies in our industry, and while innovative therapies are central to our success and will fuel our growth in our industry for decades, they are no longer enough. In order to unlock the full potential of medtech in the transforming healthcare environment, we are taking meaningful action in the areas of globalization and economic value. ","We believe successful execution in both of these areas will position us to win in the changing healthcare marketplace and will be instrumental in establishing durability in our long term performance while creating potential upside to our baseline expectations. ","With globalization, the key to sustainable growth in emerging markets will be addressing the barriers of access to lifesaving medical technology. We\u2019ve had teams in place for several quarters focused on identifying local opportunities in all of our geographies to remove the barriers to awareness and training.","In CBG, programs like Healthy Heart for All are generating results. In RTG, we have four spine product development offices set up and running in Europe, China, Japan, and India focused on adapting spine products for the local market. ","Additionally, in China, we developed [unintelligible], a cranial plating system that in 18 months went from design in Shanghai to manufacturing in [unintelligible] and is now being launched by our surgical technology sales force under the Kanghui brand. While this is a small product line, it is symbolic of the type of local innovation we want to do across all of our businesses. ","Likewise, our organization is focused on incorporating economic value into all functions, businesses, and geographies. We are collaborating with a broader set of stakeholders in developing new business models that deliver economic value to these stakeholders. Essentially, we are moving from being accountable for a product to being accountable for an outcome. ","The industry is still early in this process, but we are leading this effort and have started it in two [unintelligible] areas where we can immediately offer solutions for healthcare systems around the world: disease management and hospital efficiency. ","In disease management, integration activities of our Cardiocom acquisition are progressing well. With Cardiocom, we intend to pair our existing market leading therapies with a set of complementary services and technology solutions to more effectively treat broader patient populations across the care continuum.","These services and solutions offer benefits that are particularly compelling to the broader set of healthcare decision makers, including governments, payers, and hospital systems. One such solution that Cardiocom is developing is called [RE 30], an cost-effective 30-day readmission reduction program that is focused on minimizing heart failure readmission penalties, which hospitals in the U.S. are increasingly focused on trying to address.","Another area where we are exploring solutions for healthcare systems is hospital efficiency. And this has led to the formation of our new hospital solutions business in Europe. Hospital solutions is a unique service offering, whereby we enter into long term contracts with hospitals to upgrade and more effectively manage their cath lab and hybrid operating rooms. ","This is expected to result in wins for all stakeholders. The hospital sees an improvement in cath lab efficiency and profitability, physicians get access to the latest technologies that can lead to better patient outcomes, and Medtronic benefits not only through the increased use of our technology, but also through incremental service revenue, reduced pricing pressure, better inventory management, and more efficient use of our service personnel.","While it is still early, we already have five accounts in the long term contracts for cath lab managed services, representing approximately $300 million in revenue over a seven-year time horizon. We are particularly encouraged by the positive reaction in the market to our offering and have built a solid pipeline of potential deals.","Ultimately, medical technology has the potential to transform healthcare, from being a cost burden for most societies today to an economic driver. Nations can achieve a long term economic advantage by utilizing medical technology to more effectively and efficiently restore health to the sick and manage chronic disease to keep their populations healthy, allowing more people to be contributing members to society.","While we realize this opportunity will certainly be a big challenge, it is one where Medtronic has the capabilities and the intention to lead. Our market-leading products, in-hospital footprint, healthcare economics expertise, Lean Sigma resources, and financial strength give us unprecedented breadth, global reach, and scale, allowing us to offer broad, valuable solutions. ","We are determined to transform Medtronic from being primarily a device provider today into the premier global medical technology solutions partner of tomorrow.","Let me now ask Gary to take you through a more detailed look at our results before we take your questions. ","Gary Ellis","Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $4.194 billion increased 2.4%, as reported, or 3.3% on a constant currency basis, after adjusting for a $38 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency. ","Q2 revenue results by region were as follows. Growth rate in the Middle East and Africa was 21%. Central and Eastern Europe grew 14%. Growth in Greater China was 11%. Latin America grew 10%. Growth in Japan was 8%. South Asia grew 6%, and the growth in other Asia Pacific was 4%. The U.S. grew 2%, and growth in Western Europe and Canada was 1%. Emerging markets grew a combined 13% in Q2 and represented 12% of our total sales mix.","Q2 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.91, an increase of 3.4%. Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.89, an increase of 41%. This quarter\u2019s non-GAAP pretax adjustments included a $24 million certain litigation charge related to two previously disclosed government investigations in our CRDM and diabetes business, as well as patent litigation in our coronary business.","In our cardiac ambassador group, revenue of $2.199 billion grew 4%, with all businesses contributing to growth. CRDM revenue of $1.273 billion grew 5%, which included $11 million from our recent acquisition of Cardiocom that was recognized in our AF and Other revenue line.","Worldwide ICD revenue of $713 million grew 4%. We estimate that both the global and U.S. ICD markets grew 3%. If you look at the first half of our fiscal year, we estimate both the global and U.S. ICD markets grew 1%, which is encouraging and reflects continued stability. ","In addition, we estimate we gained a point of ICD share in international markets and we held share in the U.S. in this time period. Our top technology tiers are now significantly differentiated in the marketplace. ","Both Viva and Evera feature enhanced shock reduction algorithms, including our proprietary lead integrity alert, which the FDA recently approved for monitoring competitors\u2019 defibrillation leads when connected to our devices. Our Viva CRT-D also has a proprietary adaptive CRT algorithm which has been clinically proven to improve CRT response rates, resulting in a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. ","In addition, in a late-breaking clinical trial at the Heart Failure Society of America meeting in September, adaptive CRT technology was shown to reduce the risk of AF in heart failure patients by nearly 50%. Both Viva and Evera also have battery and capacitor design improvements to extend our industry leading device longevity.","Pacing revenue of $477 million grew 2%, outperforming the global market by nearly 200 basis points. In the U.S., pacing declined 1% year over year as we continue to see the trend of stabilization in this business. The Advisa MRI pacemaker continues to drive share gains in the U.S. on both a sequential and year over year basis.","In a late-breaking clinical trial at the American Heart Association yesterday, results from the Minerva trial were presented, which showed in a large trial of over 1,000 patients, with sinus node dysfunction and a history of atrial tachycardias, that our proprietary pacemaker features, MDP and reactive ADP, significantly slowed the progression to permanent atrial fibrillation by 61% compared to patients with standard pacemakers.","Looking ahead, assuming stabilization continues in the back half of our fiscal year, U.S. pacing would add approximately 30 to 40 basis points to overall Medtronic growth in FY14 compared to FY13.","AF solutions grew in the midteens, as we continue to gain share in the AF market, driven by our Arctic Front advanced cryoballoon system, which grew over 20%. Customers continue to adopt the second generation system due to its more efficient, safe, and effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. Looking ahead, we intend to launch our next-gen phased RF product, PVAC Gold, in Europe before the end of the fiscal year. ","Coronary revenue of $427 million grew 1%. Globalized ES revenue in the quarter was $274 million, including $103 million in the U.S. and $25 million in Japan. While GES pricing remains under pressure, we continue to gain the ES share on a sequential and year over year basis, both globally and in the U.S.","Our Resolute Integrity\u2019s deliverability, positive data regarding early dual antiplatelet therapy interruption, and unique FDA labeling for diabetes and long term clinical performance is receiving strong customer acceptance globally, despite competitive product launches and next-generation products.","In renal denervation, while revenue continues to be modest, we are investing in developing referral networks, reimbursement, technology development, and clinical and economic evidence to further strengthen our leadership position for this large long term opportunity in hypertension. We are anticipating the full launch of our next-generation Symplicity spiral multi-electrode catheter before the end of the fiscal year.","On the clinical front, we enrolled our first patient earlier this month in our Symplicity HTN-4 trial, which is focused on expanding the indication to include uncontrolled hypertension patients with a systolic pressure between 140 and 160 mmHg. We expect the results of the HTN-3 U.S. pivotal study to be presented this coming spring. ","In structural heart, revenue of $281 million increased 4%, driven by strong growth in our transcatheter valve franchise. We had an outstanding showing at [unintelligible] where data for our CoreValve U.S. pivotal trial for extreme risk patients were presented. The trial met its primary and secondary endpoints, and the results were exceptionally positive, with a low rate of major stroke, low rate of aortic regurgitations that improved over time, and no association of mild or moderate residual paravalvular leaks or late mortality. ","The FDA decided it will conduct separate reviews for the extreme and high risk studies and have also determined that no panel review is necessary for extreme risk approval. Given these developments, we now expect U.S. approval of CoreValve for extreme risk patients by the end of the fiscal year. For high risk patients, we continue to expect FDA approval in mid-FY15. ","We have also started our CoreValve Evolut R study of our next-generation recapturable [TAVI] system that features the [Envail] in-line sheath, a 14-French equivalent delivery system. ","On the CoreValve renal front, while our Q2 results were affected by the injunction of CoreValve in Germany, we were pleased that the higher German court ordered the discontinuation of the injunction last week. Our German customers were elated to learn that they would once again have access to our differentiated transfemoral technology with our unique valve sizes, catheter sizes, and indications for use options.","In endovascular, revenue of $218 million grew 5%, with solid growth in both our aortic and peripheral businesses. In our aortic business, we grew our AAA share sequentially, both in the U.S. and globally, on the strength of our market-leading Endurant II stent graft. ","Our thoracic product line posted double-digit growth as our Valiant Captivia stent graft is gaining broad adoption.","In our peripheral business, we received FDA approval for an extended indication for our Complete SE vascular stent, which is now approved for the use in the SFA and PPA in the upper leg. It is also worth noting that we divested our Pioneer Plus re-entry catheter product line, which represented $11 million of sales over the past year.","Now turning to our restorative therapies group, revenue of $1.602 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by growth in surgical technologies and neuromodulation, partially offset by declines in spine. Spine revenue of $746 million declined 3%. Core spine revenue of $636 million, which includes [BKP], declined 1%. The U.S. cores spine market continues to decline in the low single digits, with flat procedural volumes and positive mix, partially offsetting price declines.","Excluding BKP, our core spine business was flat globally and declined 1% in the U.S., relatively in line with the overall market. However, our core spine results were below our expectations as certain underperforming product lines offset the positive momentum that has been building from our new product and procedural innovations.","Our thoracolumbar, cervical, and other biologic product lines all grew this quarter, both globally and in the U.S., driven by our procedural innovation and new technologies. Cervical, in particular, had a solid quarter, with product line extensions to our Vertex platform, as well as our new Bryan artificial cervical disc, contributing to growth.","Our spine business is also increasingly differentiating itself from the competition through enabling technologies that we leverage from our cervical technologies business, including O-arm imaging, StealthStation navigation, and Powerease powered surgical instruments. ","Hospitals are investing in our capital equipment for spine and surgery as they see clear value from improved surgical precision and more efficient procedures. And this is resulting in increased revenue for our spinal implants as well as solid growth of capital equipment sales in our surgical technologies business. In fact, we are seeing core spine growth in the upper single digits in accounts that have adopted our O-arm technology. ","Outside the U.S., we continue to work on integrating our Kanghui acquisition in China, which is offsetting the lost revenue from our former Weigao joint venture. ","While there are certainly bright spots in our spine business, we continue to face challenges in other parts of the business, including BMP and BKP, as well as some recent challenges in interbody. We intend to bolster our interbody product line with the launch of new products including next-generation expandable cages. In BKP, while we did see a sequential improvement, current trends of increased competition continued, and we are working on new products to address this. ","Turning to surgical technologies, revenue of $377 million grew 11%, with broad-based growth across all three businesses: ENT, neurosurgery, and advanced energy. ENT grew double digits, with core capital platforms of fusion image guided surgery as well as NIM nerve-monitoring driving growth.","In neurosurgery, capital upgrades of the StealthStation S7 surgical navigation system contributed to another solid quarter. Advanced energy grew over 20% again this quarter, as we continue to see strong adoption of our proprietary [unintelligible] and PEAK PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast, and CRDM replacement markets. ","Turning to neuromodulation, revenue of $479 million increased 6% on solid global growth in DBS as well as a strong finish to the quarter in U.S. PAINSTIM. Our market-leading DBS business delivered another solid quarter, driven by strong client growth in both the U.S. and Western Europe. The results of our early stim trial, which showed DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease is generating significant interest in international markets. ","In PAINSTIM, while we were supply constrained in the first part of the quarter due to the new product launch, the business did grow double digits in October based on a strong implant growth following the full launch of the RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal [unintelligible] system in the U.S.","In gastro uro, while the business continues to grow, it has slowed from its previous double digit run rate due to new therapies entering the market. However, we are confident that InterStim is the most compelling therapy available and while we may continue to see some near term pressure, we expect it to continue as a long term growth driver as its value prevails in the marketplace.","Now turning to our diabetes group, revenue of $393 million grew 3%. We received approval for the MiniMed 530G with the Enlite CGM sensor, and starting shipping to customers late in the quarter. This is the first system in the U.S. that automatically stops insulin delivery if sensor glucose levels fall below a predetermined threshold, an important step toward our goal of developing a fully automated artificial pancreas.","Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our Threshold Suspend feature, including the ASPIRE study and the New England Journal of Medicine, as well as the study out of western Australia that was published in JAMA in September. ","Every MiniMed 530G pump ships with our new Enlite sensor, which is smaller, more comfortable, and more accurate. Regarding accuracy, our FDA labeling indicates that Enlite, with its 13.6% overall [mar] is comparable to competitors\u2019 sensors. We have combined these improvements with the Threshold Suspend automation feature of the MiniMed 530G system and we believe we have the best system in the market and will be focused on taking share over the coming quarters.","In addition, we began shipping to customers that had enrolled in our technology guarantee program, which is the trigger for recognizing some of the revenue that we deferred in the prior quarters. As of the end of Q2, we have $27 million of deferred revenue that we expect to recognize over the next two quarters. ","Looking ahead, our next-generation pump platform, the MiniMed 640G, remains on track for launch in international markets by the end of the fiscal year. This platform will have a number of innovative features, including a new look and feel, a simplified user interface, and the next step toward a fully automated artificial pancreas, predictive low-glucose suspend.","Now turning to the rest of the income statement, the Q2 gross margin was 74%. As Omar mentioned, there were a number of issues that negatively affected our gross margin this quarter by a combined 110 basis points. And, compared to last quarter, we recognized an additional $12 million of manufacturing variances, which had a sequential 30 basis point negative impact.","However, our standard gross margin was flat year over year as we continue to successfully offset pricing pressure through our five-year, $1.2 billion cost of goods sold reduction program. Given our ongoing spend to address quality issues, we expect our Q3 gross margin to be in the range of 74.5% to 75% on an operational basis and for a negative FX impact of 40 basis points. For Q4, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 75% to 75.5% on an operational basis. ","Second quarter R&D spending of $372 million was 8.9% of revenue. We\u2019ve continued to invest in new technologies and evidence creation to drive future growth. We expect R&D expense for the remainder of the fiscal year to be in the range of of 8.5% to 9% due to the shifting of R&D resources to enhance our quality systems, which gets recognized under cost of goods sold, as well as tradeoffs we are making to partially offset the U.S. medical device tax.","Second quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.438 billion represented 34.3% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, Q2 SG&A was 34.2%. We continue to focus on several initiatives to leverage our expenses, although it is worth noting that in Q3 SG&A spending is expected to be modestly higher given the accelerated ramp of our U.S. CoreValve sales force ahead of expected U.S. approval.","In FY14, we would expect to drive 30 to 50 basis points of improvement, which would result in SG&A in the range of 33.8% to 34% on an operational basis. And it is worth mentioning that we typically see most of our leverage in the fourth quarter.","Amortization expense for the quarter was $88 million. For FY14, we would expect amortization expense to be approximately $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $33 million, including net gains from our [unintelligible] about $15 million.","As you know, we hedge the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign exchange. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY14 net other expense to be in the range of $190 million to $210 million, which includes an expected $120 million impact from the U.S. medical device tax. In Q3, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million based on current exchange rates. ","Net interest expense in the quarter was $33 million. At the end of Q2, we had approximately $12.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $12.3 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect FY14 net interest expense to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million.","Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 19.2%. Excluding the impact of one-time items, our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q2 was 19.4%. For FY14, we expect a non-GAAP nominal tax rate in the range of 19% to 20%.","Our forecast does not assume the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expires on December 31, will be extended. Currently, the R&D tax credit provides a benefit of approximately $8 million prior quarter.","In the first half of FY14, we generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow. We are committed to returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. In Q2, we paid out $279 million in dividends and we repurchased $713 million of our common stock. As of the end of Q2, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately $68 million.","Second quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.009 billion shares. For the full FY14, we would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 1.012 billion shares, including 1.010 billion shares in Q3.","Our fully diluted share count for the remainder of the year is expected to be higher due to the higher current share price. However, it is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemption, which was $249 million in Q2, will also continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. ","Let me conclude by commenting on our FY14 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. Based on the performance through the first half of our fiscal year, we continue to believe that full year constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 4% remains reasonable for FY14. ","While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements to give you a sense of FX impact, if the exchange rates would remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY14 revenue would be negatively affected by approximately $140 million to $180 million, including a negative $30 million to $50 million impact in Q3. ","Turning to the guidance on the bottom line, we continue to expect FY14 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $3.85, which implies annual earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% on an operational basis, after adjusting for certain tax benefits that we received in FY13 as well as the headwinds from the medical device tax and incremental interest expense in FY14.","As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year. I will now turn it back over to Omar, who will conclude our prepared remarks. Omar?","Omar Ishrak ","Thanks, Gary. Before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by noting that over time we are striving to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations, which are consistent mid single digit revenue growth, consistent EPS growth 200 to 400 basis points faster than the revenue, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. ","As I mentioned earlier, over the coming quarters, we are on the verge of bringing a number of new therapies to market, and we are setting ourselves up to deliver what is arguably one of the strongest launch cadences of innovative therapies in our industry. We believe that crisp execution of both our baseline and long term growth strategies, combined with strong and disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long term, dependable value in healthcare. ","With that, we would now like to open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I\u2019ve asked Mike Coyle, president of our cardiac and vascular group, and Chris O\u2019Connell, president of our restorative therapies group, to join us again for the Q&A session. ","We are rarely able to get to everyone\u2019s questions, so we respectfully request that you limit yourself to only one question, and if necessary one followup, so that we can get to as many people as possible. If you have additional questions, please contact our investor relations team after the call.","Operator, first question please? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] The first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","If we look at the ICD market growing 3% this quarter, I don\u2019t think any of us really think the ICD market is going to sustain that type of pace, so help us back out, if you would, the stocking impact for you guys that was a negative last quarter that was a positive this quarter, and maybe help us get to what the underlying market is doing.","And second, just on the buildout of the field specialists ahead of the U.S. CoreValve launch, are you assuming in the fourth quarter that you\u2019ll have CoreValve revenues to start to leverage that? It seemed like you were suggesting that you would get some leverage in the fourth quarter. And does that imply that there will be some revenues there?","Mike Coyle ","Let me start with the ICD market. As you\u2019ll remember, last quarter we talked about the challenge being the new product launches that we had, and trying to get those on contract when we were looking for an ASP increase. And so that led to some destocking of hospital inventories as we worked through the process in hospitals that have obviously put up some larger barriers to agreement to ASP increases.","That worked itself out during the course of the second quarter, and I think you can reasonably assume that basically they\u2019re back to where they are comfortable stocking. So that now makes it a pretty reasonable picture to just look at the full first half of the year and say, what does the overall growth profile look like? And that\u2019s where we get to this roughly 1% global market growth. So that, I think, should give you a picture of what we think is happening with the overall market.","On the second question, regarding CoreValve, we are not counting on any meaningful revenues coming in the fiscal year, from CoreValve. And we are going to be obviously ramping our field representation in advance of the launch. So that\u2019s in our current set of assumptions. Obviously what FDA decides to do in terms of the approval is up to them.","Gary Ellis ","Just to add to what Mike said, the leverage we\u2019re talking about in Q4 is not necessarily coming from CoreValve. It\u2019s just our natural leverage. If you go back over history, historically in our fourth quarter, because we have more selling days and it\u2019s our strongest quarter, there\u2019s more leverage in that fourth quarter, and that\u2019s what we were referring to.","Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan ","And then just one followup. Omar, do you want to spend just another minute on China and more broadly the slowdown in emerging markets this quarter and just the confidence in the reacceleration, even if it\u2019s not next quarter or over the next several quarters?  ","","Omar Ishrak ","I think this quarter we just happened to have a bunch of different regions slow down. Just by coincidence everything happened together. We expect this to rapidly start to reaccelerate, because everywhere I go, the fundamental growth drivers are clearly there. There are patients everywhere who need attention from existing therapies.","In addition, we\u2019ve got several very concrete plans in place that will start to sort of deliver real revenue growth over the next few quarters, and we\u2019ll share that with you as they mature. In terms of China itself, I mentioned a few very specific items in terms of distributor conversions and some new products. ","And the overall environment there, there\u2019s some noise out there, because of different regulatory type concerns, but in general we don\u2019t have any hard data to support anything. Our teams are still calling for good growth going into the back half of the year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Dodd with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Matthew Dodd - Citigroup ","Question either for Omar or Chris. The core spine, it looks like it declined again. The comps weren\u2019t that tough. Your next biggest competitor is having integration issues. You put a lot of money into it, especially focusing on MIS. What parts of the business are underperforming, and why is the big picture thesis you had not coming together quicker?","Omar Ishrak ","Let me make one brief comment, and then I\u2019ll let Chris talk to that. You know, we look at all our businesses. We look at an overall period of time. And if you\u2019ll recall, last quarter we actually had a pretty strong spine performance. This quarter there were some dynamics, which Chris will talk to, but we\u2019ve got every confidence that, like I mentioned in the commentary, that the cadence of product launches we have in spine actually will deliver over the next few quarters. But I think Chris can answer the question a little more specifically.","Chris O\u2019Connell ","I think the spine market, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, is really bouncing around flat. And our performance has been flat to slightly up in the core spine business and really separating our core spine from the BKP and the BNP business. I think a lot of the same fundamentals are in place. Maybe the biggest difference this quarter is we had a little less benefit from positive mix, given that we\u2019re in the later stage of our launch cycle on some of the big platforms like Solera. ","But overall procedural growth rate is quite flat, and our pricing has been stable, down in the low to mid-single digits. And so this quarter was a little bit softer, particularly in the U.S., and then a couple of countries outside the U.S., namely Germany, Japan, and Latin America. ","But the fundamental drivers are still very much there. It is about the product refresh, first of all. Second of all, it\u2019s about the procedural innovation. We\u2019re getting good uplift from our [unintelligible] program, and our new OLIF procedure. And then as Gary pointed out, the tailwind from our enabling technologies like surgical navigation, we continue to perform much better in accounts that have O-arm, and continue to see uptake in technologies like PowerEase and the nerve monitoring.","So there are a couple of holes in the product line, particularly in the interbody space, and there are a couple of small categories like peek rods and IPDs that remain under pressure. But overall I think our perspective is it\u2019s a relatively stable situation and we expect that core spine business to be stable into the back half of the year. ","As pointed out, the BMP and the BKP businesses are both hurting us right now, although the kyphoplasty business does seem to be showing signs of stabilization in the U.S. and we watch the BMP part closely. So that\u2019s the way I\u2019d characterize it, Matt.","Matthew Dodd - Citigroup ","And then just a quick one for Gary. I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. When you look at the back half of the year, the gross margin in the third quarter is a little lower than the consensus. You\u2019ve got a tough tax comp in the third quarter. Should we be thinking more about back end loading the second half to the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, since the guidance is unchanged?","Gary Ellis ","Obviously we\u2019re not going to give necessarily quarterly guidance, but I think you\u2019ve highlighted a couple of issues that the market should take into consideration. Our Q3 last year did include some significant tax benefits. If you factor those out, you\u2019re probably more like at an earnings per share of $0.88, which is kind of similar to where we were last year in Q2. And our Q2 and Q3 tend to be somewhat similar. We\u2019re pretty close. ","And so where the consensus is right now on Q3, based on the gross margin issues we highlighted, we think we\u2019ll improve in Q3 and as we go into Q4, but it will be a little bit more in Q3 here, with these quality costs we\u2019ve talked about and the launch of the CoreValve product line. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see people moving a penny or two from the Q3 to our Q4. We\u2019re not changing our full year guidance, and we wouldn\u2019t expect the [unintelligible] to change, but seeing some shift occur from Q3 to Q4 would not be unexpected. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","Just a quick one, Gary, just kind of following up on the gross margin. You did, it sounds like, moderate the full year gross margin expectations. Can you just walk through what the change is for that? Is it just the higher product [unintelligible], or just maybe some of the warning letter charges perhaps coming in a little bit higher?","Gary Ellis ","I think it\u2019s a little bit of all of those factors. First of all, clearly the FX impact on cost of sales has been greater than we probably expected even a quarter ago. And we just don\u2019t know exactly how that will play out, but it clearly has been a little bit more negative. But the big surprises really were in the situation that as we\u2019ve ramped up all these new product lines, which the good news is we\u2019re getting additional revenue from that. ","The bad news is there\u2019s some additional costs in ramping up. You don\u2019t get the initial yields you expect right away, and especially when you\u2019re having to ramp up very, very quickly, the scrap and obsolescence also becomes higher, just due to the fact that, for example, on some of the new products, the older products are no longer as much in demand, so we have a higher obsolescence. So that\u2019s the good news of having some of these products be [unintelligible] in the marketplace. The bad news is it affects gross margin.  ","So those, we actually think are a little bit more one-time, and will start to work themselves off after Q2 here with the launches of a lot of these new products. But the quality issues, as you highlighted, we do expect will continue for at least the next quarter or two as we make significant investments in shifting resources from really the R&D efforts up into addressing our quality compliance issues, both in neuro and diabetes.","And so that\u2019s why we pulled things back a little bit. The good news is pricing is actually, if anything, kind of in line with what we expected, maybe even slightly better, and we are offsetting that with the cost reductions we have across our various product lines. But these one-time other product type costs clearly impacted us more than we expected in Q2, and we\u2019re assuming that that will play a little bit into Q3, and that\u2019s why for the full year we\u2019re down. As we go forward, we would expect those obviously would not be as significant going into next year.","Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank ","And then just for you, you had commented in your prepared remarks just around the medium-term outlook of getting back into the mid-single digits. And you talked about the number of new products coming. I guess what is your confidence that - I know you\u2019re not giving guidance for FY15 - but that as we\u2019re exiting out of \u201914, you\u2019re well-positioned to kind of get back to that mid single digit growth rate in \u201915. Or do you think that maybe some acquisitions might be needed to help get you there?","Omar Ishrak ","First, the main comment here is that like I pointed out in the commentary, the number of new products coming out is really unprecedented, at least for the time being and for several years probably before that. And not only Medtronic, but if you look across the industry, that number of products coming out, with that regularity, across the breadth of our businesses, whether you talk about the different businesses in [TVG] or some of the stuff that we do in spine that we think will accelerate growth there. Or you talk about the [IBT] piece. So if you look across the entirety of our businesses, this is quite a change. And it\u2019s got to have some impact.","And right now, we\u2019re close to mid-single digits. If you recall, last year we were there, and we\u2019ve had a few quarters here where we\u2019ve had some pressures, but we\u2019re borderline. So I would expect that these launches will help us. They have to. In addition to that, we\u2019ve got a series of other activities that we\u2019re doing, particularly around globalization, which we expect will also help us.","Having said that, we live in a place where surprises are not uncommon, and markets are still volatile across the world. Healthcare is a big issue in terms of government focus and spending. And you know, we always have to be a little cautious about where surprises can come from. But on balance, I think our position at this stage is about as good as it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve been here, in terms of future outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","Just a few followups here. Gary, I know you\u2019ve had a lot of commentary on gross margins, but if you could go from the second quarter here to the fourth quarter, at the upper end of the range there\u2019s about a 150 basis point improvement. Just specifically on FX and quality, how much of a contribution are those two factors in that 100-150 basis point improvement heading into the fourth quarter? ","Gary Ellis ","Well, the reality is your FX in the fourth quarter is much less than right now. [If the rates] stay where they\u2019re at, and that\u2019s what that\u2019s all based on, the FX impact in the fourth quarter would be relatively minor, and so you pick up almost 40 basis points right there, just through the FX. ","The other piece would be the [equality] items that we\u2019re talking about, there will also be some costs occurring in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on addressing the warning letters. But you\u2019re also having that cost on a much higher revenue number. And so that\u2019s what also drives your gross margins in the fourth quarter. If you look back historically, the gross margins in the fourth quarter also tend to be at a higher level, as I mentioned, even with the SG&A, because you have a fixed cost that\u2019s on a much higher revenue number. ","And so, in general, part of it is just your historical trends. The gross margin is probably 40-50 basis points higher in the fourth quarter. Part of it is related to FX and part of it is related to the quality cost. Should start to minimize as we go through the fourth quarter itself.","David Lewis - Morgan Stanley ","And then Mike, maybe just two broader cardio questions for you. The first, the outlook for your coronary business, considering you do next-generation stent systems in the market, is that a concern for us on volume, or price, or neither? And then just another question on CoreValve. Should we assume next quarter we see normalized market growth given the inventories? And if there are any pricing concessions given in Germany, should we assume you can get back to your prior pricing?","Mike Coyle ","We would expect normalization in the German market to take place over the next two quarters, just because of the big volatility that took place over the last two quarters. So I wouldn\u2019t say it will all be back to normal next quarter, but certainly when we get into the fourth quarter I would expect normalization to have occurred.","On the U.S. side, what I\u2019d point out is we\u2019re now six to seven questions into the launch of Resolute Integrity. We\u2019ve lapped its launch in every major market around the world, and we continue to show share capture. And I think what that\u2019s about is a couple of things. One is just the performance of the product. The handling of the product, the diabetes labeling, the recent data on [DAPT]. I mean, it\u2019s a great product, and I think the more use it gets, the more physicians are coming to appreciate that.","But it also fits very nicely into our broader CVG strategy in that we have moved increasingly toward having Resolute Integrity involved in multi product line bundles across our businesses, which include services and programs in those bundles. And that product line has been the biggest beneficiary of it.","So if you look historically, it used to be when you brought out a new stent product your share would move in the first two or three quarters, and then that would be it. What we\u2019re seeing is just a continued growth in our share position in DES, and we think it\u2019s because it\u2019s a great product and it\u2019s fitting into a great broader strategy for CVG.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America ","First just a couple of quick questions on the pipeline and the visibility of the pipeline. Just wanted to confirm that the American College of Cardiology meeting will be the place that we\u2019ll probably see the data from your renal denervation trial, the U.S. trial, as well as the next edition of the CoreValve data. And then also wanted to confirm just that the drug coated balloon data is still on track for showing it in early April at [unintelligible]. Just wanted to confirm those dates.","Gary Ellis ","Those continue to be our operating expectations.","Bob Hopkins - Bank of America ","And then I was wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about the ICD market and why it\u2019s improving. Understanding there\u2019s some stocking issues, and you made some comments earlier, but I was just wondering, is this uptick in the market purely a function of a lot of new products in the market for the first time in a while and maybe seeing better pricing? Or do you actually think there\u2019s been a unit uptick in the ICD market?","Mike Coyle ","We\u2019ve certainly seen stabilization in the initial implants for ICDs, which is a good sign, obviously. Something we\u2019ve been looking for, and have now seen. On the pricing side, basically it\u2019s flat overall pricing, and we are seeing price increases tied to the new product launches in our high tier, but we continue to see pricing pressure in the mid tier technologies. You net it all out, it\u2019s relatively flat ASPs, which of course is a nice improvement over the 4% to 5% ASP declines we were seeing at this time a year ago. So generally speaking, it\u2019s market stabilization that we\u2019re seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Your line is open. ","Josh Jennings - Cowen & Company ","Omar, I just wanted to ask you quickly about the Cardiocom business, your venture into the disease management space. How should we be looking at that in terms of is it a growth driver? Is it a service that Medtronic is going to be providing to try and ensure deeper partnerships with hospitals and hospital systems? And how much investment do you need to develop or acquire new technology platforms to really optimize your offering? ","And then specifically for the important avenue of heart failure rehospitalization prevention, there\u2019s a potential pulmonary monitoring device going to be approved by the FDA. Can you speak to Medtronic\u2019s views on pulmonary pressure or intracardiac pressure monitoring? What role will it play in the important market opportunity and how can Medtronic tap into this, and any internal plans to leverage the Cardiocom platform? ","Omar Ishrak ","Let me give you some perspective. First of all, Cardiocom is an operating business with strong results and strong growth prospects with what it has. It has some unique capabilities and we\u2019re excited about what they\u2019re doing, and they have strong momentum and growth by themselves.","Now, when we take Cardiocom and latch that onto our distribution team, which is far bigger than what Cardiocom had on their own, we obviously open up a lot more opportunities for that business to grow and increase their sales of their existing products. But in addition to that, the combination of our devices now, going after a more selected patient pool, together with Cardicom\u2019s support services, offer up a future opportunity that is unprecedented, that no other device company and a cardiac monitoring company has ever really got together in this way. And we expect real improvement in growth going forward as a result of that.","Now, with respect to other things that we\u2019re to do, as you know, studies have shown that to move the needle and think like heart failure requires a broad set of services, a broad set of solutions, that have to be executed through multiple stakeholders. We\u2019re in the process of creating that holistic solutions business and leading that effort, and we think Cardiocom is a big asset in that journey. Other things will certainly be required, but on its own, Cardiocom is an extremely good platform for us to base this journey on. It\u2019s really a long term method.","I\u2019m going to say as well that in terms of the heart failure rehospitalization, we\u2019ve got evidence already that using the Cardiocom capabilities we can have a measurable impact on the reduction of heart failure in specific hospitals, and we think it\u2019s a very cost effective method through which we can achieve that goal. Sensors will be developed over time that will enhance that capability, but in our experience, just doing one thing in an area of that type is usually not enough, but a broad solution is required.","I\u2019ll let Mike comment on specifically the product and technology and his views on that, and maybe our plans.","Mike Coyle ","I think it\u2019s important to look at heart failure as both a short term issue and a long term issue. The short term issue is the 30-day rehospitalization challenge, which all hospitals in the U.S. agree is something that is a big challenge for them to manage. And that\u2019s where the Cardiocom solution, with this basically very fixed window of time in which to impact, has proven to be very effective. ","The alternatives that are being looked at are permanent implants that are very expensive solutions, which really are not the right answer for the short term challenge, but the question would be are they the right solution for the long term challenge of heart failure management. ","And in that case, clearly as Omar just mentioned, there are a lot of variables involved here. It\u2019s not just the availability of the measurement from the device, but also the tracking of that data, the specificity and sensitivity of those data, and the cost of managing that information. ","And we think that\u2019s a very expensive solution that\u2019s being looked at for the long term. We are really focused on trying to focus in that near term window, not only with Cardiocom, but also with some of the predictive diagnostics that are coming out of our CRDM organization. ","So you know about Reveal. We talked about the Reveal Linq, which is the next-generation loop recorder that we have, and there are other predictive diagnostics you\u2019re going to see us talk about over the course of the next six months that we think can be very helpful in managing heart failure patients in that window where there\u2019s a very clear economic need. So that\u2019s how I would characterize our approach to the strategy. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. ","Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse ","Mike, several questions for you. Firstly, common wisdom is that the [Partner One] indication in the U.S. is kind of flattening out. As you enter that market, do you see much opportunity for growth prior to indication expansion?","Secondly, I know you guys have had a little sluggishness in enrollings for TAVI, and there\u2019s been talk about extending it to [STS2]. Any progress on that front?","And thirdly, given the joint FDA CMS approval track for renal denervation, how should we be thinking of that uptake in the States now that you have definitive evidence relative to what we\u2019ve seen in Europe?","Mike Coyle ","On the second one, let me just ask Jeff. Do you want to comment?","Jeff Warren","On [unintelligible] TAVI, we\u2019re talking to the FDA, but there\u2019s really no update on looking more on the enrollment criteria.","Mike Coyle","First, I think it\u2019s important to point out that what we are seeking approval for in terms of the range of sizes and alternative access routes for CoreValve should significantly expand the number of patients who are going to be candidates for TAVI, because currently the current approved competitive devices are certainly limited in terms of their size and also the invasiveness of a transapical approach. ","So we think that there is still plenty of opportunity to both take share in the existing segment as well as to expand the number of patients who are getting treated within the extreme risk. So we\u2019re confident that what we do in terms of our overall expectation for market size continues to be what we would expect to see. ","On the third question, obviously this is one of the first that\u2019s on the joint track of CMS approval as well as FDA approval. Our goal would be to have essentially a three month window between those two, the FDA approval and the follow on reimbursement, but again, this is fairly uncharted territory, so we\u2019re going to have to see where that leads, but that\u2019s certainly where we are managing our strategy toward.","Gary Ellis","And we would expect that obviously, having had data, we\u2019ve always said you have in the data the proven information in the U.S., we think will actually help accelerate the marketplace, and having reimbursement at the same time or close to it would obviously help. So we expect the uptake in the U.S. would be much faster than what we\u2019ve said outside the U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rick Weiss from Stifel. Your line is open. ","Rick Weiss - Stifel Nicolaus ","On CoreValve, can you give us a little more perspective? Mike, do you think you\u2019ve lost share in Germany as a result of the injunction, given what seemed to be some heavy selling into the market in advance of this? And can we assume that you\u2019re shipping normally now? And just remind me, I think you said you have strong growth in TAVI in Europe. Can you quantify that more specifically, with a more specific number?","Mike Coyle ","On Germany, obviously if you just look at total revenues that we just reported in the quarter, we lost share on a reported basis, because we had no product that we were able to sell other than for the compassionate use side. But as you may recall from the first quarter, when customers learned that they were going to lose access to this product, there was a lot of demand that basically accelerated purchases. So in terms of overall share of implants, it\u2019s hard to say, but I don\u2019t think there probably was a lot of share loss in the quarter. And obviously now that we\u2019ll be able to go back into the market with the full offering, I don\u2019t expect there will be going forward. But it\u2019s going to take a couple of quarters for that to normalize overall.","Rick Weiss - Stifel Nicolaus ","And on the [unintelligible] side, just as a follow up, is there any way to size to opportunity for the 530G and any sense, of the patients who are getting the devices, are these patients already on a Medtronic pump and upgrading? Are MDI patients converting, or competitor pumps? Any perspective there would be welcome. ","Omar Ishrak ","Well, it\u2019s a little early to get too much data on this, because we just started shipping it, but I\u2019ll tell you that the principal response has been outstanding, both from patients who receive the device and just in anticipation of what the product can do. So we\u2019re really confident about the outlook and the general acceptance of this product as we see it. ","I think in general most of our Medtronic patients were upgrading at this stage, but we expect some conversions as well. I doubt if there\u2019s going to be too many MDI patients going to this technology first. But again, it\u2019s very early. We just started shipping this product just about a month or so ago. So let\u2019s wait and see. But like I said, the anticipation from our patients is very high, and a lot of excitement around it. ","Okay, so with that, it\u2019s time to conclude. Thank you all very much for your questions. And I\u2019d like to briefly note that as you work on filling your 2014 calendars, we plan to host our institutional investor analyst meeting on June 5, which will be held again in New York City. ","With that, and on behalf of our entire management team, I\u2019d like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. And for those of you in the U.S., I want to wish you and your family all a very happy Thanksgiving. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q3 call, which we anticipate holding on February 18. Thank you.

We delivered revenue growth, operating margin, and EPS all ahead of Street expectations. Q4 revenue grew 3.6% organic, with outperformance in RTG and MITG offsetting challenges in CVG and difficult comparisons in Diabetes. In addition, Emerging Markets continued to be a big driver, growing 12%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points, including currency, reflecting our entire organization\u2019s focus on Enterprise Excellence. On the bottom line, we grew adjusted diluted EPS 8.5%, or 9.2% at constant currency. ","For the full fiscal year 2019, revenue, EPS, and free cash flow all came in above the guidance ranges we set at the beginning of the year as we executed against our commitments. Revenue of $30.6 billion grew 5.5% organically. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 10% on a comparable, constant currency basis and 11.5% pro-forma. Free cash flow of $5.9 billion grew 62%, much faster than earnings, reflecting the focus of our entire organization on improving this important metric. Last June at our Investor Day, we set a target to improve our free cash flow conversion to 80% over the next two to three years, and we achieved it in just one year. FY 2019 free cash flow conversion was 83%, notably above our peer average. In FY 2019, we invested our capital into future growth platforms, with a focus on returns, while at the same time increasing our returns to shareholders through share repurchases and a rising dividend. ","In Q4, we overcame significant challenges and relied upon the diversification of our business to deliver another quarter of solid top- and bottom-line results. Let\u2019s discuss some of the more important drivers of our performance, starting with our Restorative Therapies Group, which had another very strong quarter, growing 6.5%. The launch of the Mazor X Stealth navigated robotic system is off to a strong start and building momentum. We sold 26 systems this quarter, increasing our spine robotic market share to more than 70%, with an installed base that is now more than three and a half times that of our closest competitor. While Mazor sales are driving Brain Therapies growth, we believe they are also a good leading indicator of future growth in our Spine division, as customers that are purchasing our Mazor system are also choosing to increase their share of Medtronic spine implants. ","In fact in Q4, over 80% of our Mazor systems were sold to customers who chose to enter into combined capital and implant contracts, and the percentage of Mazor robotic cases that use our Medtronic spine implants continued to climb, exceeding 60% in Q4, a double digit increase from Q3. When you combine our Spine division sales with the sales of our capital equipment from our Brain Therapies division used in Spine surgery, our Spine division grew 5.6%, with the U.S. Core Spine business growing 11%. This is how our competitors report, and a strong indication that our enabling technologies robotics, navigation, imaging, and powered surgical instruments will help increase sales of spine implants. ","In RTG, I\u2019d also highlight Neurovascular and Pain Therapies. In Neurovascular, our market-leading stroke portfolio continues to perform extremely well with double-digit growth in stent retrievers, flow diverters, coils, and neuro access products. In Pain Therapies, we continued to gain market share despite the market\u2019s recent slowdown. Our Pain Stim business achieved a number one share position in Q4 for the first time in two and a half years, driven by our differentiated Intellis system, with its Evolve workflow algorithm and Snapshot reporting. In MITG, we grew 5.1%, driven by strength in Advanced Stapling and Advanced Energy. This is an impressive performance, as the Surgical Innovations business overcame challenges resulting from the shutdown of a major sterilization supplier\u2019s facility. I just cannot say enough about how our teams stepped up and successfully managed this issue, quickly identifying alternative suppliers and rerouting our supply chain to get inventory to the right place at the right time. We expect to be back to full sterilization capacity late in Q1. ","In CVG, we grew 1.1% as we faced challenges in drug-coated balloons and LVADs as well as CRM replacement devices given where we are in our replacement cycle. At the same time, multiple product lines showed exceptional strength in the quarter with high-teens growth from our Reveal LINQ insertable loop recorder, and mid-teens growth from both our Micra transcatheter pacing system and our Arctic Front AF ablation catheters. We also continued strong, double-digit growth in our TAVR franchise. Our TYRX antiinfection product grew in the high-twenties, and we saw a notable pick-up in its utilization following the WRAP-IT data presentation at the American College of Cardiology meeting in March. ","In Diabetes, we grew 0.6%, an anomaly given difficult prior year comparisons that we described on our last earnings call. Despite the challenging comparisons, Diabetes delivered mid-teens growth in international markets and our fourth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth in standalone CGM. Looking ahead, we expect Diabetes growth to reaccelerate in the first quarter and to be accretive to total company growth in FY 2020. At the ADA conference in June, we plan on hosting an investor meeting where we will update you on the progress of our pipeline and an exciting series of product launches we have planned over the next 24 months. ","Now, turning to Emerging Markets, our performance continues to be strong, growing 12% this quarter, and representing 16% of Medtronic revenue. Our strength was diversified across all four groups and across multiple geographies, with China growing 13%, South Asia by 22%, and Southeast Asia by 20%. In addition, Middle East & Africa grew 13% and both Eastern Europe and Latin America grew 8%. Our strategies of public and private partnerships, optimizing the distribution channel, and in some markets localization of R&D and manufacturing are driving growth and differentiating Medtronic. Overall, it was another solid quarter despite the noted headwinds, and a really strong year for Medtronic.","But as we look forward, we\u2019re even more excited about what lies ahead, as the investments we\u2019ve been making in our pipeline begin to pay off with accelerating revenue growth, and ultimately, value creation for our shareholders. We expect our top line to accelerate over the course of FY 2020 and into FY 2021, driven by the anniversary of recent headwinds, combined with major products that are launching now or will launch over the next 12 months. It\u2019s worth highlighting some of these near-term launches. I\u2019ll start with CVG. In our TAVR business, we are expecting low risk indication expansion in the U.S., as well as launches of our next-generation TAVR valve, the Evolut Pro Plus. We intend to launch this valve across all sizes, including a large, 34 millimeter valve. In CRHF, two of the biggest launches we have in FY 2020 are number one, our Reveal LINQ 2.0 insertable cardiac monitor and number two, our Micra AV transcatheter pacing system. ","LINQ 2 will feature Bluetooth connectivity, five year battery longevity, enhanced sensing specificity, and the ability to monitor new physiological parameters. Micra AV, which is one of the most disruptive products in our pipeline, is expected to launch around fiscal year end. It will enable us to access and disrupt over 55% of the eligible pacemaker market, up from 16% today. In MITG, we continue to make great progress with our soft tissue robotics program, and we\u2019re now preparing for our initial launch in FY 2020, consistent with our commentary over the last several quarters. Our initial launch activities will occur outside the U.S. and support our clinical and regulatory strategies in geographies around the globe. I know everyone is anxious to see the robot, and for competitive reasons, we\u2019ve obviously kept this program close to the vest. The good news is that we plan to host an analyst event this Fall to show the robot. We\u2019re in the process of working on dates, and as soon as we get everything confirmed, we\u2019ll be sure to send the analysts an invitation. ","In RTG, as I mentioned earlier, the launch of the Mazor X Stealth is off to a great start, and we expect this will continue to drive growth in our Neurosurgery business, along with creating demand for our Core Spine implants. In Neurosurgery, we are preparing for the launch of the Midas Rex MR8 drill platform in the first half of FY 2020, and we expect its differentiated features to drive share growth. In Neurovascular, we just launched our next generation stent retriever, Solitaire X, and our React 071 aspiration catheter, advancing our leadership in the treatment of ischemic stroke. In Pain Therapies, we expect the full launch in FY 2020 of our Accurian nerve ablation platform. ","In Diabetes, we expect to file for a non-adjunctive indication for our CGM sensor in early FY 2020, thereby allowing us access to the U.S. Medicare market for the 670G. In addition, in FY 2020 we expect to launch the MiniMed 780G, our Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop System with Bluetooth connectivity. The 780G will feature next-generation algorithms designed to improve time-in-range to over 80%. The system will reduce the burden of carb counting, enable remote monitoring as well as remote software downloads, and include several key enhancements to our CareLink system. What all this means for the company as a whole is that we expect our growth rate to accelerate over the course of FY 2020, with the second half growing faster than the first, as we one, anniversary recent headwinds, and two, bring these innovative products to market over the next several quarters. ","Moreover, we expect our top line momentum to build heading into FY 2021, as we get the increasing benefit of the FY 2020 product launches that I just mentioned, as well as the benefit of several products that we expect to launch early next fiscal year, such as: our Percept deep brain stimulation system, the very first deep brain stimulator with sensing capabilities; our DiamondTemp focal ablation catheter system, which will initially launch in Europe; and our Interstim Micra 3cc MRI-compatible sacral nerve stimulation system, which is fully rechargeable and 80% smaller than our current, market-leading device. While there isn\u2019t enough time today to go through the longer-term pipeline, with all of these products launching, the takeaway that I want you to have is that each of our four groups has the potential to see accelerating growth in FY 2021. Let me now ask Karen to take you through a discussion of our fourth quarter financials. Karen?","Karen L. Parkhill","Thank you. As Omar mentioned we delivered fourth quarter organic revenue growth of 3.6% and EPS growth of 8.5%. For the full year our adjusted operating margin expanded 120 basis points including 50 basis points on a constant currency basis and in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. We remain focused on our enterprise excellence programs better leveraging our size and scale and driving improved effectiveness and efficiency across the company. This past year in particular the benefits of the program are most evident in SG&A where we drove 40 basis points of improvement. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 31.5%, an improvement of 140 basis points or 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. In addition to driving expansion by executing on our enterprise excellence program we also absorbed the unplanned expense of China tariff as well as a negative 20 basis point impact on our operating margin from the sterilization issue with purposeful cost control throughout the company.","In the fourth quarter we successfully executed a 7 billion euro debt offering and used the proceeds to reduce U.S. dollar denominated debt. The new euro issuance carries a weighted average coupon rate of 7\/8% lowering the effective interest rate on our long-term debt portfolio and providing savings for the company for years to come. Our adjusted nominal tax rate was 14.1% for the quarter and 13.6% for the year in line with the expectations we said on the third quarter call. Excluding the non-recurring tax benefits we received in fiscal year 2019 our adjusted nominal tax rate would have been approximately 14.75%.","Perhaps most exciting is our annual free cash flow at $5.9 billion, a significant improvement over the $3.6 billion we generated last year and well above our guidance and expectations. All of our colleagues have made improving free cash flow a priority and this focus is yielding strong results enabling us to achieve our conversion goals well ahead of the schedule I gave you at our Investor Day in June. Going forward, you can expect our free cash flow to grow largely in line with earnings as we continue to target an 80% conversion rate above our peer average over our long range plan.","Before I move to guidance, I want to reiterate our commitment to balanced capital deployment. We continued to invest in future growth through disciplined investment in R&D, along with tuck-in acquisitions like Mazor and Epix, among others. And, we remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our annual free cash flow to our shareholders. In fact in fiscal 2019, we returned $4.6 billion, 78% of the free cash we generated to our shareholders through both dividends and net share repurchase. Our total shareholder payout for the year was 65% on adjusted net earnings.","Now, turning to our guidance for fiscal year 2020. As a starting point, we expect organic revenue growth to be 4% plus or minus. While the impact of currency is fluid, if recent exchange rates hold, foreign currency would have a negative impact on full year revenue of approximately 1% to 1.5%. By business group, we expect MITG to grow 4.5% to 5%, RTG to grow 4% to 4.5%, Diabetes to grow 6% to 8%, and CVG to grow 2%, plus or minus, all on an organic basis. ","We expect our first quarter growth rate to be lower than normal on the heels of a better than expected fourth quarter, transitory headwinds from the sterilization shutdown in MITG, and a slowdown in our Peripheral business from paclitaxel-coated balloons. Given these, we expect organic revenue growth in the first quarter to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%, with currency having a negative impact of 2.1% to 2.6% at recent rates. By business group, MITG and RTG are expected to grow 3% to 3.5%, CVG looks flat, and Diabetes is expected to grow 5%, plus or minus, all on an organic basis. From there, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year, with constant currency growth closer to 4% in the second quarter, and north of 4% in the second half.","We expect to continue to drive margin expansion of approximately 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven by our Enterprise Excellence initiatives. For modeling purposes, we would assume a modest improvement in the first half of the year, given lower revenue growth and a slight FX headwind, with increasing improvement in the second half. We expect our tax rate to increase from 13.6% last year to 16% to 16.5% in fiscal year 2020, given the changes associated with U.S. tax reform that we discussed previously. ","Of course, we remain focused on optimizing our underlying operating tax rate over time under these new regulations. With respect to earnings, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.44 to $5.50, which includes a negative $0.10 impact of currency at recent rates. For the first quarter, we expect a $1.17 to $1.19, including a $0.04 currency headwind at recent rates. ","After delivering on each of our commitments in fiscal year 2019, I couldn\u2019t be more excited about fiscal year 20 and beyond. As Omar outlined, we expect our revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year as we anniversary recent headwinds and launch a series of major products. And, we expect this momentum to build into fiscal year 2021, with each of our four groups having the potential to see accelerating growth next fiscal year.","Now I will return the call back to Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Karen. Before we go to Q&A, I\u2019d like to acknowledge our 90,000 Medtronic employees who work tirelessly and are dedicated to fulfilling the Medtronic Mission in alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for so many around the world. In fiscal 2019, our employees together with our physician partners, served over 75 million patients or more than two patients every second.","Let\u2019s now move to Q&A. In addition to Karen, our four group presidents, Mike Coyle, Bob White, Geoff Martha, and Hooman Hakami, are also here to answer your questions. We want to try to get to as many questions as possible, so please help us by limiting yourself to one question, and if necessary, a related follow-up. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question this morning comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Bob Hopkins","Hi, thank you and good morning. Congrats on a strong finish to the year. I just wanted to kind of ask a little bit about some of the revenue forecast that you're making, so two very quick things; one, given your first quarter guidance of about 2 to 2.5, can you just walk us through in as much detail as you're willing to provide some of the incremental headwinds that you're seeing in Q1 or that you're forecasting in Q1 versus the 3.6% growth that you put up in Q4? And then I'll just go ahead and ask a quick follow-up right here, you know this is a question for Mike, just wondering if you could comment on TAVR and what you're seeing since the presentation of the data at ACC because the TAVR number looked maybe a smidge lighter than we were thinking so those are the two questions, thanks for taking them?","Omar Ishrak","Karen, you want to take the\u2026","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure, thanks Bob, appreciate the question. So, in the first quarter we have guided to 2% to 2.5%, and as you know the fourth quarter came in a little better than we expected. Recall that we had guided around 3% for the quarter and we came in at 3.6%. So given the strong finish to the fiscal year it's likely that we'll see a little bit of softness in the first quarter. We also have the lingering effect of the sterilization issue in MITG. We did use our inventory on hand to help mitigate that in the fourth quarter and now we have less on hand as we move into Q1. We expect the sterilization issue to be behind us as we said at the end of the quarter but will face some slowdown in revenue given that probably to the tune of about 20 million to 30 million which is about 100 bps of MITG growth there. And then, as you know, Q1 will be the first quarter, the full impact of the DCB issue following the uncertainty of the FDA announcement in June. That could be another $20 million to $30 million headwind in CVG and about 100 basis points of CVG growth. But as we noted on the call we do expect our growth to accelerate over the course of the year as we anniversary various headwinds and we introduce our strong pipeline. I'll let Mike answer the TAVR question. ","Michael J. Coyle","Yeah Bob thanks for the question. We were quite pleased with the TAVR number. I think the overall growth rate for both -- the global growth rate was around 11%, U.S. growth rate around 12%, and we were very much in line with that. The announcements at ACC obviously were for low risk and there have been no low risk approvals yet. And of course there's no reimbursement for products that are unapproved. So, we didn't see a marked increase in penetration of that group that will follow after the FDA does the actual approvals of the expanded indication for use. But I would point out that a year ago we were much more active in terms of opening up new accounts which carries with it stocking that would have -- could have more revenue in the prior year number. So, implant growth rates for us were more in the mid-teens rate in the U.S. So, we're very pleased with obviously the momentum in the business and especially with the potential to further grow it in the low-risk patient population. ","Bob Hopkins","Great, thank you.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Bob. Next question please Carol. ","Operator","Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Lewis","Hi, good morning. Just one for Karen and one for Hooman here. So Karen, I wondered if you could help us with earnings per share for 2020, other income was a significant driver of EBIT in 2019, we also had a very significant debt restructuring. So, as you think about 2020, can you just sort of help us understand our assumptions what they should be as it relates to other income and more specifically, actually interest expense because to us the earnings guidance looks a little conservative, so any help there will be very helpful?","Karen L. Parkhill","Sure, thanks for the question David. So, on other income, it was a little strong this quarter, and we had a significant strength in it from just the currency and our hedging program. But we also did have other royalty expense come in better, and as we focused on driving improved royalty income where we can, you're seeing that play out and that should continue. In terms of the debt restructuring, we were obviously pleased with the euro debt offering in our U.S. debt tender, and going forward you should expect around 200 million to 210 million a quarter in interest expense from us.","David Lewis","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just, Hooman a quick question on diabetes. I think, in the recent months, there's been sort of this emerging concern that the industry is changing very rapidly just given reimbursement, regulatory, and various technology changes. I just wondered if you could help us understand how is Medtronic positioned over the next one to two years from a share perspective in both your pump and CGMS business, and do you think an independent diabetes business would allow you to adapt or grow more quickly? Thanks so much.","Hooman Hakami","Sure, thanks David, let me actually take the second one first. We get a lot of benefits from being part of Medtronic. The scale and breadth of the company we leverage every single day with respect to things like wafer scale technology that we're doing with CVG. As we think about global expansion, we leverage our regulatory resources and relationships around the world so there's tremendous benefit and I think that helps us drive the growth that we need.","Now with respect to the competitive positioning and all of that, for all that's been said and written about the competition and its impact on us let me just maybe give you a few data points with respect to how we finished. First our installed base in FY 2019 grew by mid single digits. This is true globally as well as in the United States. In addition our patient retention rates were in line with historical rates globally and as we think about FY 2020 we see a lot of things to be excited about, international that you heard from the commentary is going to be and continue to be a big portion of our growth. This is about 45% of our global revenue and it's growing in the mid teens and we expect it to grow in the mid teens. ","And the other dynamic that we outlined at the Analyst Day is the CGM penetration and the CGM growth of our installed base as well as standalone CGM growth which had four consecutive quarters of triple digit growth. You put all of those things together David we feel really good about our ability to be accretive to overall Medtronic in FY 2020 and that's even before we talk about the pipeline that we will share with you at ADA which is incredibly exciting and will bring a whole host of new innovation over the next 24 months.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks David, can we take the next question please Carol. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Vijay Kumar","Hey guys, congrats on a nice quarter here. Two quick ones for me one product and one maybe on the guidance here. On the product side Omar you know the robot at the Analyst Day this is new information to this, there had been some concerns maybe this could get pushed out. I'm just curious on is this now the preview of the robot, does that mean we could see a launch of the robot end of the year, some really nice Mazor X number so is that sort of a preclude to what we could see on the surgical robotics side in terms of RAM? And then on the guidance front Karen you mentioned tax headwinds, are the tax regulations finalized and if they are finalized when we think about fiscal 2021 are there any tax planning new structures that you could put in place to offset some of this as we look forward for 2021? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay, let me start on the robot and I will let Bob also comment on it. First of all you'll see the actual robots when we invite you, that is the product that we intend to commercialize. And I think our commitment for an FY 2020 launch is delayed [ph] as I mentioned in the commentary. But let me just say a little bit about the comparison of the Mazor X, as you know Mazor X is a different robot. But this methodology of combining our high value consumables which in the Mazor case are actually are tools as well as the spinal implants. ","In commercial packaging with the capital equipment is a big differentiator for Medtronic and I can tell you that Bob's team is all over this looking at the experiences that we are getting with the Mazor X launch and will translate them. And this is not just the commercial framework, it's how we structure the sales force with the training and whole variety of other areas. So, I don\u2019t know, Bob do you want to add anything. ","Bob White","No, perfect Omar. Vijay, again thanks for the question. We are excited about where we are at with the program. We look forward to learn a lot more this fall when we hold the Analyst Day for you. For obvious reasons we're not going to go into the details of our global launch, and which countries and when. But consistent with Omar said, and consistent with what we said in the past we are preparing for an FY 2020 launch.","Karen L. Parkhill","And Vijay in terms of the guidance on the tax headwinds the final regulations are not yet out so it is not final. We will obviously be focused on optimizing our tax rate over time and we've been working on that already. And so you've seen our guide in taxes move from a range of 16.7 to the lower end of that range 16 to 16.5. And of course once the regulations are final we will be focused on continuing to optimize where we can. In terms of FY 2021 our hope is that we can improve from there but we'll see. And if you just think about the guidance that we've given with the tax rate headwind, tax is about $0.20 a headwind on our year. We've offset some of that with the debt offering that we did, call it about $0.08 and we've got the $0.10 headwind on FX. So when you look at all of that together, if you look at our adjusted EPS growth it would be about 8% to 9%. ","Vijay Kumar","Thank you guys.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Vijay. Next question please Carol.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Robbie Marcus","Great and again congrats. Either maybe for Karen or Omar if you could just talk about some of the product launches into fiscal 2020 and then fiscal 2021, did that give you confidence in accelerating growth throughout the course of this year and also I think it's great to hear accelerating growth in fiscal 2021 as we sit here over a year out from that. What are the products that gives you confidence? ","Omar Ishrak","Well there's a whole series of them and I'll go through them because they're all contributing and they're all exciting. First the low risk indication on the TAVR plus they have a little pro launch which gives you a launch of [indiscernible] sheets, that's in FY 2020. Together with that the LINQ 2 which we're really excited about with more accuracy, with more physiological parameters as well as Bluetooth connectivity. That sensitivity like straight up in FY 2020. And then in RTG you have the recurrent RF ablation system in the [indiscernible] MRI. I mean these are continuous innovation products that we think will make a difference and then back to CVG actually the Micra AV which will have an October submission and we expect sometime late in the year sales to start, will also have a carryover into FY 2021 on a strong basis. ","And then last but not the least diabetes which we expect the 780 to launch towards the end of the year as well as the non-adjective [ph] labeling which will allow us greater market access and that will happen much sooner in the year. So, those are things that we can talk about like right now in FY 2020 and all of these will in many ways carry on into FY 2021. But there are specific ones and I will repeat the Micra AV because that'll have a full year benefit and that's a big disruptive program for FY 2021. But also the DiamondTemp RF ablation catheter that comes out of CVG and then RTG has all series of products. You know the DBS percept product from neuro modulation which is the first product of sensing that will be launched in FY 2021. ","In addition to that in terms of health the interest in Micra which we will launch again early in FY 2021 maybe towards the end of FY 2020. And the diabetes will have continued roll out of the 780G which will have significant benefits which are mentioned in the commentary. And again RTG the soft tissue robotics which I just talked about will launch in FY20 but the full benefit of that we will start to see in FY 2021. So that's a lot of products and I'm telling you I didn't even mention all of them. There are some in staplers and other areas in neurovascular, and so there is a whole series of products that continue our momentum in CRHF. So, we're pretty excited and the pipeline here is solid. These are solid products, many of them very close to launching and others close to approval. So we're really excited about this. ","Karen L. Parkhill","And Robbie our pipeline is the most exciting but I would just remind you too that particularly in CVG we have some anniversary of some headwinds that will help us with the growth acceleration as well. We had the accounting change in our services and solutions business in Q2 which is one anniversary. We'll anniversary the loss of our MCS share loss in Q3 and then we'll have a partial anniversary of the drug coated balloon issue in Q4.","Robbie Marcus","That's really helpful. And maybe Karen just a follow-up for you, appreciate all the commentary on the operating margin progression through the year. Is there any help you can give us on maybe gross margin versus operating margin and how currency might flow through that line item? Thanks.","Karen L. Parkhill","Thanks for the question. On gross margin, the gross margin as you know can be impacted by our product mix. And so you haven't seen at least in FY 2019 expansion in gross margin. We've driven the expansion in operating margin and SG&A. While our enterprise excellence program is designed to offset the pressure that we have in pricing and mix there could be some years where we see expansion in gross margin but I wouldn't count on a lot there. In terms of FX we do have an FX headwind next year and that should show up some in the gross margin line.","Ryan Weispfenning","Great, thank you Robbie. Can we go to the next question please Carol.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you for taking the question, can you hear me okay. ","Omar Ishrak","Yes we can, go ahead Joanne. ","Joanne Wuensch","Wonderful, I have two questions, the spinal cord stimulation market could you please give us an update on your view of that, I think you mentioned that you believe that Medtronic grew faster than the market in the quarter? And then my second question has to do with the paclitaxel panel that's upcoming, what do you think we should expect out of that? Thank you.","Omar Ishrak","Okay, thanks Joanne. I will let Geoff take the spinal cord question and then over to Mike. ","Geoffrey S. Martha","Yeah, so Joanne, how are you doing. On the spinal cord stimulation market it is a little bit down, flash to even down last quarter. But we did -- and Intellis is performing strong relative to the competitors. We are getting great feedback on the battery, the recharge speed, and how long the charge lasts, and the outcomes we're getting from the overall workflow which will be published in the Vectors [ph] trial and the Vector study. So we're getting a great feedback and we've picked up by our estimates about two points a share year-over-year and we're back to the number one share position which is first time in two and half years. So we're feeling good. Now the overall market like I said I wish it were growing faster. It has slowed and we have a couple thoughts on that. I mean one is that we see a lot of technology that's been -- we are on the back-end I would say of a nice wave of technology, innovation, and clinical indication expansion and we are in the back end of that. And then there are -- I wouldn't say there's new payer policies out there but there is increased payer scrutiny that we're seeing really primarily driven by the performance of our competitors devices that is as far as the market.","Michael J. Coyle","And then on the question of the paclitaxel, obviously we are looking forward to that opportunity to broaden the discussion of the data that's available on paclitaxel product. Obviously we have full visibility to our own data and are very confident in the performance of our admiral product because we have over 1800 patients worth of data that has been carefully followed. So from my perspective the discussion to date has really focused on the three PMA submissions from Medtronic -- and I think there's a much broader set of data to be looked at in all cases it is more favorable from our perspective. First, there's additional follow up that capture patients who wants to follow up in the data that we have been doing and it's certainly been helpful to the overall numbers for the submissions on the PMA data which will be presented at the session. ","In addition we have other data sets, the Japan randomized controlled study of 100 patients that basically not only showed no statistical difference in death rates between PCP and balloons but also showed a numerical higher rate in the PTA arm. And then we'll also be submitting data from the impact deep study which is in the critical and ischemia group which is a study that was sized very similar to the FFA study at the FDA referenced 358 patients and followed after five years. And in fact there we saw a higher death rate associated with the PTA arm then the DCB arm is five years. So these additional data sets we think will be helpful. They are also data sets that we would expect to see from patient net analysis that they are doing as well as we think there will be interesting data from claims analysis that should be helpful. Of course we don't have visibility to all of the other company's data. So we'll only see those when we get to the actual panel itself but everything we have seen has us even more comfortable than we were in the beginning in terms of the safety of these products and they are profoundly efficacious for limiting reinterventions in the patient group. ","So we go into the meetings, we believe the data is very strong but it's important to understand that no studies have been sized to answer the question of mortality in this patient group and so it's going to be important to us that we look at the risk benefit of these datasets and as I said everything we've seen from our own data sets which are the largest in the industry make us very confident.","Joanne Wuensch","Thank you very much and good quarter.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thank you Joanne. Next question please Carol.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Please go ahead.","Matthew Taylor","Thank you for taking the questions. I just had one follow up on the paclitaxel question, I wanted to understand if you had a view on PCR statement that came out this week, it seems relatively favorable. If you could talk about how much of a headwind is baked into your guidance or maybe if things go well in June, how much of that you think could come back?","Omar Ishrak","So, we were pleased to see the PCR statement, it certainly was a more encouraging or let's say softer statement than FDA had made basically pointing out the limitations as a matter of analysis data that has been shown. And reinforcing the efficacious nature of these products in terms of improving patient outcomes. So, they were clearly more balanced in their view than we have seen in the FDA discussions. Now obviously we'll see more data coming in and we'll have to weigh that. In terms of how we have provided guidance we're basically assuming that what FDA has stated is going to remain for the entire balance of the year and obviously we've seen how the market has reacted to that and so we just extrapolated that out through the rest of the year. So if FDA were to become more favorable in their commentary obviously that could have improve outcomes. But right now our guidance would assume there will be no change coming out of it.","Matthew Taylor","Thank you. And then just wanted to ask one question on neuro. So, the neurovascular growth is very strong, could you talk about some of the components of that and whether you're seeing a stronger market there, are there any product launches that help you this quarter?","Michael J. Coyle","Sure, first of all in neurovascular we have -- Medtronic we have a broad portfolio playing in every segment and that is our strategy and we're in number one positions in both ischemic and overall hemorrhagic. And we've recently refreshed that entire portfolio. Nobody else can say this but it's a very strong market, we're very well positioned across every segment. Now what's driving our growth in the near term is first of all entering the aspiration market, we have already launched the 068 and now the 071. Riptide systems are catheters and we've got, we're getting really, really positive feedback on both. The 068 started out a little slow because we had to make some adjustments to. We had soft launch, made some adjustments to the product and now it's picking up. The 071 hit the ground running, we're getting great feedback, and we estimate that we're somewhere around 15% of this market already, well ahead of our plans in the aspiration segment, well ahead of our plans. We see ourselves getting to 25% by the end of the fiscal year and we think we will eventually get to 50% of this aspiration market. And on top of that we just launched our next gen stent retriever to maintain and extend our lead in that segment. So those are some of the things that are driving it. And I think the other big drivers is the global nature. We're just growing very fast in China and so the fact that we're global is also helping especially in China. So it is a global and broad refresh product portfolio.","Matthew Taylor","Thank you, great color, thanks.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Matt, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Kristen Stewart","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to just talk a little bit just about the free cash flow. You guys did a great job of really improving the metrics there. How should we just think about the deployment of capital, I know in the prepared remarks you talked about the commitment to at least 50% to shareholders but how should we just think about more on the M&A side, I think you mentioned tuck ins but should we expect an increase in the rate of maybe acquisitions going forward and more focus on products and really leveraging the portfolio or just how should we think about that going forward?","Omar Ishrak","I think Kristen you're sort of on the right track there. Yes, we have a lot of fire power here and we're building it and we intend to use it in M&A and focus on M&A indeed isn\u2019t tuckins that accelerates our growth. And examples of things that we've already done expect more of the same. We just said the title [ph] is fine acquisition with Epix Therapeutics earlier in the year with Nutrino Health which is a great bug into diabetes by far with the nutritional database and you will see that, that works through into our next generation pumps. And then the Mazor X obviously which is -- I congratulate Geoff on that one because that's a great acquisition and what it is really pulling through in spine. So, those are examples and they're not all exactly that small either and we expect more of that. Now we will always be disciplined about this. We will look at the returns that we get and it has to be above our cost of capital. We look at the strategic fit and we look at the earnings impact and we look at those three things in a balanced manner as well as our team's ability to execute and put all that together and that's the strategy that we have for M&A and we've got tremendous firepower and you will see us accelerate that process as much is available.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, so it sounds like kind of taking the M&A focus and driving more depth across the businesses versus going broader, you feel like you're in all those spots that you are and need to be?","Omar Ishrak","Yeah, that is correct. They are sticking out there that helps the growth of our current business.","Kristen Stewart","Okay, thanks very much. ","Omar Ishrak","Thanks Kristin. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning, thanks for taking the question. One high level question for Omar, one product related question for Geoff. So Omar it feels like there's been a little bit of a shift in the regulatory environment towards more post market action from FDA. Do you agree with that, has anything changed on the premarket approval side, and what are the implications for Medtronic? And second for Jeff, there's a new competitor coming out in sacral neuro modulation space potentially second half of this calendar year. So what's your plan for protecting your position in that market and just remind us of the timeline for your next generation smaller rechargeable device, I think I heard earlier fiscal 2021? Thanks for taking the questions guys. ","Omar Ishrak","Okay, you know first of all the FDA question. Look The FDA's fundamental mission is to protect the safety of the American public and they do an excellent job in fulfilling that mission. And I think as more data becomes available they're using it wisely to make sure that their post market studies and that the approval process has in it enough of the safety profile and we are completely supportive of that. They're working closely with the industry in making sure that approval process are accelerated the right way but not compromising safety at any time. So we are pretty supportive of the moves that they're making. And we don't really see any major changes to the device approval framework that it has in place. I think that's about it. Geoff, you want to talk about sacral nerve. ","Geoffrey S. Martha","Sure, hey Larry. So good question. I think first and foremost regarding our new product that come into market we expect it to launch in the beginning of FY 2021 and it is going to be this is a rechargeable device with really strong MR labeling and about a 3cc device. So, with our overdrive battery technology on this which we've proven with Intellis and pain stim it's just superior. And so between the size and the overdrive technology we think this is a winner. The product that a competitor is launching here in the near-term will also be a rechargeable device but I think it's 5.5cc. So I think we compare it very well and the gap between when they launch, we expect them to launch. We don't know -- we don't really know, we don't know how the FDA is going to treat things like cyber security and things like that. So we really don't know when they're going to launch but conservatively for us we expect a three to four quarter gap there. And look Larry, I can say this, this isn't the first time that we have faced at RTG a new competitor coming into our markets that we've pioneered and we maintain a high share. And I'd like to think and matter of fact I'm confident we've learned from these experiences which have been painful especially like pain. When you go back to think about pain stim we have learned, we have built these lessons learnt into our commercial playbook. We changed our commercial leadership across RTG and all I can say is we are ready. And I don\u2019t know what else to say we're ready for this. ","Larry Biegelsen","Thank you guys, thanks for taking the questions. ","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Larry, next question please Carol.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Matthew Miksic","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So I thought maybe just a couple of quick pipeline type questions if you could expand on your thoughts around a few things. Just one on uninterrupted any update on the transeptal delivery system pathway forward on that and thoughts on left atrial appendage closure which is something that you ought to be and I'm sure you plan to be exposed to? And then the second just kind of general topic, we see often in these meetings a lot of activity, clinical evidence, interest around innovation kind of rebounding for both hypertension and arrhythmias and just if you could update us on your intermediate or long term strategy for returning simplicity to commercial products, appreciate your thoughts?","Michael J. Coyle","So I'll take those questions, uninterrupted we do expect in the fiscal year to do our first transeptal [ph] version of it. So that work is progressing and we're confident we're going to find a path forward to just as we did in the TAVR world to start with the valve that was critical [ph] but then move up to transeptal delivery system. On that appendage closure we do not currently have a product in development that we very -- follow developments in this space very carefully. We do have a lot of competency in our structural parts business that's applicable to this space. But we also would want to have a superior product before entering into that type of market. So we have a list of designs that we're interested in but we have no announcement to make today on that topic. And renal derivation is actually progressing as we discuss. We expect to have the pivotal trial result presentations next spring which will be sort of key to the FDA approval cycle. ","But as you pointed out there's a lot of clinical evidence being generated around this topic that has been presented both at -- PCR meeting here the week as well as at the HRS meeting two weeks ago. In support of both of those clinical trials is both very supportive of the technology. And the ones on atrial fibrillation were particularly interesting. We sponsored one that was presented to both clinical trials here this week at PCR. It basically showed a 60% reduction in patients who develop atrial fibrillation in a highly selective group of patients who had hypertension and were randomized to renal renovation. So the data continues to be very encouraging but obviously given the events of the [indiscernible] study results it will be very important that we have highly controlled data to show the efficacy of this product and we're very confident based on the pilot studies that we have already published on and the trial we are executing with FDA that when we get to next spring we're going to have some very good efficacy and safety data to discuss. So, we are excited about that market. ","Matthew Miksic","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Josh Jennings","Hi, good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to ask Mike just about curriculum in heart failure and the road to recovery there is about half of the revenue pie for CVG. And maybe you could just focus on the anchors, high voltage and LVADs whether we just had to wait for anniversaries or is there anything incremental you can share in terms of returning those businesses either to flatter or back to growth and then just to add on follow-up at each rest you had some really interesting data on some pipeline products post field ablation and the extra vascular ICV and just any incremental thoughts there in terms of the signal that those data sets provided and your outlook for those two platforms? Thanks a lot.","Michael J. Coyle","True, starting with the portfolio of product lines. Actually on the CRT side we have I think some very exciting product development activities in addition to some easing headwinds and obviously the biggest challenge we've had in CRT has been we've significantly extended the battery life of these products. We have run into that replacement headwind and as you know in the CRT space for high power half the market is replacements. We still have a few quarters to go in terms of those headwinds being significant but as we head into next year into FY 2021 we actually see that go neutral and that will really help us in terms of just the overall growth profile of the business. ","But beyond that at HRS we launched the first active fixation Quadripolar [ph] lead for use in CRT for both CRTD and CRTP which physicians seemed very excited about and we have our new Galaxy platform, our next generation of ICD's releasing in the third quarter which basically will both add Bluetooth connectivity to the product but also some very important pacing features that both will enhance the performance of our products from atrial fibrillation perspective as well as from heart failure rehospitalization rate. So those will be I think really helpful in terms of just getting our CRTD and CRTP product lines accelerating from where they have been and then obviously we'll get the headwind going away as we head into FY 2021. ","On the LVAD side obviously we saw a fairly significant reduction in market share that took place at the middle of the year as a result of competitive product launches. We are going back on the offensive with our lateral data to basically take advantage of the smaller size of the HVAD system to basically show lower complication rates in surgical implants of the thoracotomy approach to the placement of the device. And we also think the data sets around the stroke are going to be in our favor as we get further evidence of the performance of these products. And so obviously the anniversary in the second half of next year is going to be very helpful to our overall growth rate but then obviously we're hoping to take sequential market share as we take advantage of the performances of the product. ","And then in terms of your question around the PSA and EVICD [ph], we're very excited about both of those programs. We would expect to basically go into pivotal studies with the EVICD this year which obviously has the benefits over existing sub cue products of actually allowing antitachy pacing and post op pacing to be done with the products. So, that we think will provide a big advantage. It's also got a footprint that looks like a standard ICD as opposed to much larger device you see in the sub cue application. And so we believe that will carry with it benefits at implant including potentially lower infection rates. ","And then PSA is probably the most exciting thing that we see in the holy atrial fibrillation ablation space. This allows us to actually do ablation without thermal energy either heating or cooling by essentially disrupting the miosites directly which has the potential to really address all of the major complications associated with atrial fibrillation or ablation of atrial fibrillation. So that coupled with our entry into the focal ablation segment with the Epix device, the DiamondTemp device really now significantly broadens our portfolio from what we have traditionally been cryo company focused on PAF ablation. So really nice work by the team to basically expand our product offerings. Both EVICD and PSA of course are beyond the FY 2020 window but we will speak to those I'm sure at the Analyst Meeting next year to give you more guidance as to when we expect them to be major revenue drivers for us.","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Josh. We'll take one more question please Carol.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Pito Chickering","Good morning guys, thanks for squeezing me in here. A few questions on China. China is obviously a very important market for you guys. It looks like revenues in China slowed in the quarter to 13% from 16% last quarter. How are the tariffs impacting that business, what growth are you embedded within the 2020 guidance and how should we think about the doubling of tariffs and how that impacts your growth in that market?","Omar Ishrak","Well, first look we're really excited about China and that is an important market like you point out and it will be the biggest health care market just by the size of the population and opportunity. So it's a market we intend to be present in. And look we are quite pleased with our performance. I mean, the business certainly grew sequentially quarter-over-quarter and it continues to grow and we expect pretty reliable double-digit growth from China on a very consistent basis and we're getting that. And so it is a market that we are committed to, one that we see is a big growth driver for us. The tariffs do pose somewhat of a headwind in terms of our margins but it's one that we will cover and we will offset. We faced some of that in FY 2019 which we successfully managed to offset and we don't expect a major increase in FY 2020 but there may be some towards the back half of the year which we will manage. ","But more importantly the need for our products in the Chinese population is very clear. So the demands from both the doctors and the patients and we will follow through with that. We have an outstanding team there with scale, with critical mass, presence in the big cities as well as the outlier regions in private hospitals as well as the government hospitals. And all of those are growth drivers for us across the board and in all our businesses. So make no mistake China is a big priority for us that we're all focused on and we're very confident that it will be a continued consistent growth driver in the double-digits for Medtronics.","Pito Chickering","Okay, and one follow up, this is a very big quarter on Mazor, because the pipeline looks for new robot sales in 2020 and how does this spike similar market share and households we had robot installed for over a year changed.","Michael J. Coyle","Can you repeat the second part of that question, the first part was...","Pito Chickering","Leave it. For hospitals where the robot has been for over one year how would you spike assumable if market share changed within that year?","Michael J. Coyle","Well, I will start with that question. I mean we are definitely seeing where we have robots installed and to your point up and running and we've trained the physicians and the surgical teams and our reps. We're clearly seeing faster growth and greater market share versus accounts that we don't have a robot. And that same can be said to maybe a slightly lesser degree when we have navigation in the OR without the robot. So basically we have enabling technology, our value proposition is better and we're seeing faster growth and better market share. We're seeing it quite a bit different and especially in competitive accounts. And the difference I'd say from a competitive standpoint between just having nav in OR versus having nav arm and the robot is the amount of competitive accounts that we're getting into. Customers that are big spine centers where we were zero and our competitors had these accounts very well covered. They're calling us and we're getting in there and not only getting robotic share but we're getting non-robotic cases. So, it is quite dramatic and so we're very happy with it. It's the overall value proposition of all of this technology working together. And the path to better outcomes for patients and better financial outcomes for the hospital and we're building evidence around both of those. So in terms of the outlook going forward we feel bullish. So far it's much better than our deal model, Mazor sales and for a variety of reasons. And we feel that we continued strong double digit growth in this area based on the existing -- we just launched the Mazor X edition with navigation, we just launched that. And so that still has a lot of runway but we have a series of continuous innovation on top of that, things like so we can navigate with the robot more of our enabling technology like more of our mileage platform drills and such. And then we will be which I don\u2019t want to talk about for competitive reasons we will be adding other features that I think are even more differentiated that will improve basically the spine procedures. Take time out of these spine procedures and also drive more consistent reliable outcomes. So we feel very strong and that's what's generating excitement around the robot is the improvement in outcomes. ","Pito Chickering","Great, thanks so much. ","Ryan Weispfenning","Thanks Pito, Omar do you want to\u2026 ","Omar Ishrak","Yeah let me just close out, thanks to all of you for your questions. And on behalf of our entire management team thank you for your continued support and your interest in Medtronic. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our Q1 earnings call which we currently anticipate holding on Tuesday, Aug 20th and with that thank you again very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

The call will be opened for a question and answer session following the speakers' prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ryan Weispfenning, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead?","Ryan Weispfenning","Great. Thank you, Maria. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's second quarter conference call and webcast.","During the next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Medtronic's Chief Financial Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2016 second quarter, which ended October 30, 2015. After our prepared remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","First, a few logistical comments, earlier this morning, we issued a press release containing our financial statements and our revenue by division summary. We also updated our combined historical Covidien-Medtronic financial statement presentation, which is posted to our investor relations website. This presentation now contains FY'15 quarterly P&L stated on a month-aligned basis instead of the prior quarter-aligned basis. Comparisons made today will be against the month-aligned P&L.","Next, you should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC and we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at medtronic.com.","Unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, and our year-over-year growth rates are given on a comparable constant currency basis, which adjusts for the negative effect of foreign currency translation and includes Covidien Plc in the prior year comparison, aligning Covidien's prior year monthly results to Medtronic's fiscal quarters. These adjustment details can be found in the reconciliation tables included with our earnings press release.","With that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.","Omar Ishrak","Good morning. Thank you, Ryan, and thank you to everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported second quarter revenues of $7.1 billion, representing growth of 6% at the upper end of our mid-single digit expectations. Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.03, growing at 11% on a comparable constant currency basis and reflecting 480 basis points of leverage, above our baseline expectation of 200 to 400 basis points.","Q2 was a strong quarter. Our operational performance remains consistent and we believe sustainable across all our functions, groups and regions. At the same time, we are outperforming the overall market and delivering operating leverage.","We are also executing on our value capture programs from the Covidien integration and realizing the targeted cost synergies. This combination of solid top-line growth and leverage is generating significant accessible free cash flow, which provides us enormous flexibility to deploy through strong returns to our shareholders, paying off debt and pursuing targeted acquisitions.","Despite our strong performance however, we recognize foreign translation is a significant pressure to our bottom-line on a reported basis as it is for most multinationals, but we are attempting to offset this as much as possible by stretching our operations and through our conventional hedging programs.","As we look ahead though, our confidence continues to grow around our ability to develop the right mindset; business models and offerings to lead and compete in the emerging value based healthcare models around the world. I am pleased with our organization's willingness and aptitude to explore new and novel ways for Medtronic to not only deliver better clinical and patient outcomes, but to tie success to these outcomes with providers, payers and governments.","Our strong revenue growth is resulting from crisp execution on three growth strategies, therapy innovation, globalization and economic value. These strategies are designed to create competitive advantage for Medtronic by capitalizing on three long-term trends that we keep playing out in healthcare. Namely, the continued desire to improve clinical and economic outcomes, the growing demand for expanded access to healthcare and the optimization of cost and efficiency within healthcare systems.","We have tried [ph] to take in each of our strategies into three independent growth vectors and we continue to quantify and communicate our performance against these goals. In therapy innovation, we are seeing very strong adoption of our new products. Our new therapies growth vector accounted for nearly three quarters of our total company growth contributing approximately 420 basis points. This remains well above our goal of 150 basis points to 350 basis points.","In our cardiac and vascular group, which grew 8%, we continue to see strong growth from recently launched products that are helping to create important, rapidly growing new medtech markets such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, drug-coated balloons, AF ablation and insertable diagnostics.","CVG is also seeing new therapies drive growth in space businesses such as our recently launched Evera MRI ICD, which is helping to drive both, sequential and year-over-year global high power market share gains.","Over the coming quarters, we expect to launch a number of additional exciting new products that will continue to differentiate us in the market and help protect and grow our leadership position.","For example, we continue to make progress on bringing our revolutionary Micra Transcatheter Pacing System to the U.S. Last month, we had a very successful late breaking data presentation at AHA, and a simultaneous New England Journal of medicine publication. This data form the basis for our FDA submission, which we filed in Q2.","In addition, CVG continues to invest in key intermediate to long-term technology programs. Building on our success in transcatheter aortic valves, we are particularly enthusiastic about our recent acquisition of COV. This company has a differentiated transcatheter mitral valve, which has the potential to create a new, multi-billion dollar end market. We are also making progress in enrolling our SPYRAL HTN clinical program for renal denervation, an important therapy that we are pioneering. Renal denervation has the potential to help fulfill the huge unmet need in treatment resistant hypertension.","Overall, I feel that our strategy has positioned us exceptionally well in the global cardiovascular device market. The team is executing consistently, gaining share, developing new markets and effectively leveraging it is breadth of therapy innovations to positively affect the lives of thousands of patients around the global.","In our minimally invasive therapies group, which grew 3%, new therapies such as our differentiated Endo GIA Reinforced Reload stapling system and LigaSure Maryland Jaw laparoscopic surgery sealer and divider are driving strong growth.","MITG has a full therapy innovation pipeline, with a specific focus on four areas, the transition from open surgery to minimally invasive surgery, respiratory compromise, lung cancer and gastrointestinal cancer. Across these growth drivers, we are developing solutions that span the entire continuum of care aspiring to enable earlier diagnosis, better treatment, faster competition free recovery, and enhance patient outcomes through less invasive solutions.","I am pleased with the clear strategic roadmap the MITG team has developed through a very complex mix of products and capabilities. The strategy supports the outcomes-based Medtronic mission and will serve as the foundation against which we are assessing our entire MITG portfolio. In our Restorative Therapies Group, which grew 5%, we have a number of new products driving growth. In Surgical Technologies, we recently launched O-arm 2 [ph] surgical imaging system NuVent sinus balloon.","In Neurovascular, our pipeline Flex and Solitaire FR devices are leading the rapidly growing stroke market. In spine, our business outside the United States performed well and grew above the market. In the U.S., while our performance was below market, we did see sequential improvement after adjusting for the extra week in Q1.","In Neuromodulation, while we continue to make progress against our FDA consent decree commitments and are focused in resolving this matter our - revenue has been somewhat affected by this situation. We also are facing increased competition in Pain Stim where our sales were flat compared to last year.","Our Restorative Therapies Group is urgently addressing these specific issues as well as leveraging the breadth and scale of the group to the commercial implementation of surgical synergy. One example is a program that combines O-arm placements with increased spine implant commitments.","Under our new integrated RTG sales management structure, we have already finalized several of these contracts in the first half of this fiscal year and have seen notable increases in our spine implants sales in these accounts. While still early, our expectation is that strategies like this will result in improved performance.","Our Diabetes Group, which grew 11%, also has new products driving growth, including the MiniMed 530G and MiniMed 640G systems as well as MiniMed Connect, which provides convenient and discreet access to patient data and remote monitoring from the user smartphone.","In our Non-Intensive Diabetes Therapy Division, we recently launched pattern snapshot for iPro Professional CGM, which uses new algorithms to streamline data interpretation for healthcare professionals. These advancements along with a full pipeline of new products and solutions are aimed at creating an annual cadence of innovation that can extend our leadership position globally.","As a result of the products that are currently launching, as well as our robust pipeline and the potential of new markets across all of our groups, we believe, we sustain our new therapy growth vector at the upper end of the 150-basis point to 250-basis point range.","Now let's turn to our globalization strategy. In Q2, emerging markets grew 11%, a sequential improvement over the prior quarter and contributed approximately 140 basis points to our Q2 total company growth. This was just below are baseline goal of 150 basis points to 200 basis points, but we are encouraged by a relatively consistent above market performance in countries that are under significant macroeconomic pressure.","We continue to see increased diversification of our emerging market revenue, which stabilizes the growth rate and reduces the dependency of any single market. In Q2, Greater China, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America, India and Southeast Asia, all grew double-digits. In Mainland China, we grew 13% and improved sequentially the balance contributions from each of our four groups.","We continue to implement our channel optimization strategy in China, which is focused on transitioning our distribution channel to include consolidated platform distributors. We are also leveraging the breadth of our therapies to establish expanded multiline selling presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Another priority is to develop deep partnerships for the Chinese governments such as the one that we have already forged for the Chengdu Government in Sichuan Province and are looking to further broaden.","Recently, our entire executive committees spent a week in China meeting with the several provincial and central government officials to discuss the creation of more partnerships across all of our businesses. Although complex, China will become the largest healthcare market over the long-term, serving more patients and doctors than any other country. We can never lose sight of this potential.","In the Middle East and Africa, we grew 10%, driven by newly formed joint venture with our largest Saudi distributor. Despite political instability in the region, our team continues to deliver strong growth, reflecting the fact that governments in this region continue to prioritize healthcare investments.","In Latin America, we grew 11%, driven by Mexico, Chile and Argentina. In Brazil, we significantly outperformed the market, with strength in MITG, Neurovascular and Neuromodulation. While the outlook in Brazil remains uncertain given the macroeconomic and healthcare challenges in the country, we believe we can outperform the market by continuing to partner with healthcare stakeholders to reduce costs while improving patient outcomes.","We did experience some weakness this quarter in Eastern Europe and Russia, which together account for less than 10% of our emerging market revenue. This was a result of a planned distributor changeover in Eastern Europe, continued weakness in the Ukraine and Belarus and year end procedure delays affecting our MITG business in Russia.","We continue to make progress in pursuing potential opportunities such as government partnerships to improved growth in this region. Across emerging markets, we are applying our standard market development activities as well as our differentiated approach of local channel optimization in China, India and Saudi Arabia and establishing government partnerships like the one in Chengdu.","In addition, we are developing unique partnerships with private entities such as the Abraaj Group. In Q2, we made a commitment to Abraaj Group's growth market's health fund, which is focused in improving access to health care in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, as well as the other developing markets.","Abraaj Group purchases our bills, hub hospitals, surrounded by networks of referring hospitals and clinics. We are strategic partners in this market development effort, with a commitment to improve patient access, healthcare delivery outcomes and efficiency and product supply within these Abraaj hospital networks.","In summary, we believe that the penetration of existing therapies into emerging markets represents the single largest opportunity in medtech over the long-term.","Turning now to our economic value growth strategy, our services and solutions growth vector contributed approximately 20 basis points to our Medtronic growth. While this overall result was below our goal of 40 to 60 basis points, it represents strong mid-30s growth, almost all organic.","We expect to further improve our growth as service as a solutions is adopted and expanded across all our business groups. In Care Management Services, formerly known as Cardiocom, we had high-teens growth in Q2, driven by a strong performance within the U.S. via healthcare system. This business represents an important platform for us, especially as post-acute care services become even more critical in the bundled payment models of the future for different states.","In Cath Lab Managed Services or CLMS, where we provide administration, operational efficiency expertise and daily management of Cath Lab [ph] hospitals, we continue to generate rapid growth. In Q2, we expanded our CLMS business into Latin America by purchasing a majority stake in auction to acquire Cardiored, a privately held Chilean Cath Lab Managed Services provider.","Cardiored already has a presence in Chile, with long-term agreements to operate 10 Cath Labs and 9 private clinics throughout the country. We expect the Medtronic's scale will help to quickly expand Cardiored presence both, within Chile and throughout Latin America.","We also continue to expand our operating room managed services or ORMS offering, which applies Cath Lab business model to an operating room setting, utilizing the breadth of our MITG products and expertise. We have now signed six ORMS deals, representing approximately $140 million in cumulative revenue with an average life of seven years.","Since starting hospital solutions two years ago, we have now completed a total of 66 long-term CLMS and ORMS agreements with hospital systems, representing over $1.5 billion in revenue over an average span of six years and we have a large number of potential contracts at various stages of negotiation with providers around the world.","We also continue to expand our solutions offerings into diabetes care delivery with Diabeter, a Netherlands-based diabetes clinical research Center that has developed a unique care model that incorporates standardized and scalable protocols and we continue to grow the number of Diabeter patients expect to expand Diabeter beyond the Netherlands to other countries around the globe as we transform our Diabetes Group from a market-leading pumps and sensor company to a holistic diabetes management company.","All of these activities are expected to serve as building blocks for value-based healthcare, where payment is based in actual outcomes over specific time horizon. Specifically, we are creating unique offerings that combine bundled solutions across the care continuum to target specific patient populations or cohorts within a particular disease. This is consistent with the direction of CMS's bundled payment initiative, which we fully support and are encouraging expansion into other three states, where we participate.","In the end, we remain convinced that there is an incredible amount of value to be realized in healthcare and we believe our technologies and services can play a central role, with providers, payors and governments to make this shift to value-based healthcare successful.","Turning now to the P&L, and as I mentioned earlier, we delivered EPS leverage in Q2 of 480 basis points in a comparable constant currency basis, which exceeded our baseline expectation of 200 basis points to 400 basis points. All areas of our global operations are executing to the plan we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year as we deliver our productivity improvements and cost synergy expectations.","We also executed below the operating income line, delivering above plan financial performance through higher interest income, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. It is also worth noting that the strong performance was against a difficult comparison due to legacy Covidien's fiscal year end in the prior year.","For the back half of this fiscal year, we expect to significantly exceed our baseline EPS leverage expectation of 200 basis points to 400 basis points. As we have communicated, this over performance will be driven by planned cost synergies from the Covidien integration.","The integration of Covidien is in fact going very well. We are executing on our priorities to preserve, optimize, accelerate and transform. Our cultures continue to come together, talent retention and employee satisfaction, which we monitor and quantify through frequent employee surveys and focus groups remained strong.","Our cost synergy efforts thus far have been focused in the following areas. In direct sourcing, where we are using best case contracts and improved purchasing power to achieve meaningful savings, common expense policies, which we are driving across the organization. Real estate, where we have now closed over redundant sites mostly back-office and field distribution centers and SAP, where we are bringing legacy Covidien entities on to Medtronic's common enterprise system, leveraging our internal expertise from having orchestrated similar system-wide implementation within legacy Medtronic.","In addition to executing on the promise cost synergies, every function is encumbering additional opportunities for savings. Covidien acquisition is truly serving as a catalyst to re-examine and redefined our overall operating models and cost structures.","Another key element of the Covidien acquisition that we are just beginning to execute on is unlocking our trapped cash. We were able to free a significant amount of our trapped cash in Q2, transferring $9.3 billion into accessible cash to an internal reorganization as part of the Covidien legal entity integration.","The ability to deploy this cash in the U.S. gives us increased flexibility and options. We are working quickly and diligently to determine the best way to utilize this cash, with the priority of creating long-term shareholder value, and will communicate our strategy in the very near-term. This is just one more example of the benefit of the Covidien acquisition, perhaps even more meaningful than the cost synergies that we are delivering.","The improved financial flexibility and our ability to invest in U.S. technologies and products as well as return additional cash to shareholders is and is expected to continue to be a significant differentiator for Medtronic shareholders. Our strong revenue growth and focus on operating leverage is generating significant free cash flow.","In Q2, we generated $1.1 billion and are expecting to generate nearly $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years. We are deploying our capital with a focus on M&A investments, providing strong returns to our shareholders and meeting our debt commitments.","Earlier this fiscal year, we increased our dividend by 25% in and we expect to grow our dividend rate faster than earnings, with the intent of reaching a 40% payout ratio on a non-GAAP basis within the next few years. As an S&P dividend aristocrat, we remain focused on delivering dependable long-term dividend growth.","This quarter, we also accelerated our share repurchase activity from our prior plans and are committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Regarding investments, we remain disciplined when evaluating potential M&A opportunities. Any investment we must make must be aligned with and ultimately strengthen one or more of our three growth strategies, while at the same time offers high return metrics and minimize near-term shareholder dilution.","In summary, I am extremely pleased with how our team is executing and Gary will not take you through a more detailed look at our second quarter results. Gary?","Gary Ellis","Thanks, Omar. Second quarter revenue of $7.058 billion increased 62% as reported or 6% on a comparable constant currency basis, which excludes the $452 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency.","Acquisitions and divestitures contributed a net 30 basis points to Q2 revenue growth.","Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.03, an increase of 1% versus the $1.02 delivered by Medtronic, Inc. last year, for an increase of 11% on a comparable constant currency basis after adjusting for the $0.12 impact to earnings per share from foreign currency translation.","Q2 GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.36, a decrease of 57%. This quarter's non-GAAP adjustments to earnings on an after-tax basis were up $442 million certain tax adjustment, primarily related to the internal reorganization that resulted in approximately $9.3 billion of previously trapped cash becoming accessible and $29 million loss on forward interest rate swaps related to the same internal reorganization, a $373 million amortization charge, a $56 million net restructuring charge and $32 million acquisition-related items charge, primarily related to the Covidien integration and a $17 million certain litigation charge related to increased product liability.","For Cardiac and Vascular Group, which accounted for 35% of our total company, revenue grew revenue by 8%. CVG had strong performances in all three of its divisions, with each growing above the company average. Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure or CRHF, had another strong quarter with 7% revenue growth, which included mid single-digit growth in both, high power and low power, high 20s growth in AF solutions and low 30s growth and Services and Solutions.","We estimate the CRHF implantables market is growing in the low-single digits and we continue to take share both, year-over-year and sequentially. High Power had particularly strong quarter in U.S. ICDs, driven by the launch of the Evera MRI ICDs, the only FDA-approved MR conditional ICD system.","We also continue to see strong customer acceptance of our differentiated CRT-D technology, including our AdaptivCRT algorithm, quadripolar lead VectorExpress programming and improved device longevity.","In low power, we are seeing strong demand for review link, which resulted in robust diagnostic growth in the mid-20s. Pacemakers sales also have solid mid single-digit growth in the U.S., where we gained over 400 basis points a share due to strong pacing pull-through generated by review link and increasing customer preference for MRI safe technology, including our recently FDA-approved Advisa SR MRI single chamber device.","Looking ahead, we are expecting to receive FDA and CE Mark approvals for both, our Amplia MRI and Compia MRI CRT-Ds along with our Visia AF MRI single chamber ICD by end of the fiscal year. Our Coronary & Structural Heart division grew 10%, with mid-20s growth in Heart Valve Therapies, mid-single digit growth in coronary and low single-digit growth in Extracorporeal Therapies","In Heart Valve Therapies, transcatheter valves grew in the high-30s globally, including mid-fifties growth in the U.S., our first full quarter of U.S. commercial launch of the CoreValve Evolut R.","We estimate the global TAVR market is growing nearly 30%. In Japan, we are expecting reimbursement and launch of CorVel in Q3. Regarding the intermediate risk, we expect to meet our SURTAVI trial enrollment target this winter and submit to the FDA by the middle of FY'17, with data expected at ACC 2017.","In our coronary business, drug-eluting stents grew mid-single digits globally, including high single-digit growth outside the U.S. on the strength of Resolute Onyx and mid single-digit growth in the U.S. from the continued acceptance of Resolute integrity.","In balloons, we grew low double digits as we continue to gain share with our differentiated Euphora PTCA product family. In the Aortic & Peripheral Vascular division revenue grew 10%, including mid single-digit growth in Aortic, low double-digit growth in peripheral and mid-teens growth in endoVenous.","In Aortic, while we face increased competitive pressure outside the U.S. and felt the impact of market reimbursement cuts from Japan, the business grew in high single-digits in the U.S., driven by the continued market adoption of our enduring Endurant IIs AAA stent graft.","We also are seeing strong adoption of our Aptus Endo Anchor technology, which is resulting in competitive comp conversion and AAA device pull-through. In peripheral, we continue to execute on our U.S. launch of the In.Pact Admiral drug-coated balloon and maintain our leading market position on the strength of our exceptional, clinical and economic data.","Data presented at TCT and published in JACC, showed sustained superiority in primary patency and re-intervention rates over balloon angioplasty at two years. Cost-effectiveness data released at Viva showed In.Pact Admiral lowers the overall cost of treatment.","In endoVenous, we launched VenaSeal closure system in the U.S. last month and expect it to drive growth in this business going forward.","Across CVG, the use of wraparound programs, services and solution bundles and multi-line contracting strategies continue to drive growth, with a number of cross business multi-line contract growing over 20% in U.S.","Now turning to our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, revenue grew 3% and accounted for 33% of total company revenues. MITG's revenue performance was driven by mid single-digit growth in surgical solutions and low single-digit growth in patient monitoring and recovery.","It is worth noting that MITGs growth this quarter was slightly slower than its historical run rate as a result of a difficult comparison due to the legacy Covidien fiscal year end in the year ago.","Surgical Solutions growth of 5%, included mid single-digit growth in advanced surgical and early technologies and low single-digit growth in general surgical.","Advanced Surgical continued to benefit from new products and the continued shift from open to minimally invasive surgery. The business had solid growth in EndoStapling, driven by the Endo GIA Reinforced Reload as well as in Vessel Sealing as a result of the continued acceptance of the LigaSure Maryland Jaw.","We estimate that surgical volume market growth in U.S., while still growing has normalized. General surgical benefited from the RF Surgical acquisition, which closed in Q2.","Early Technologies delivered strong results, particularly in the U.S. from growth in gastrointestinal diagnostics. The Patient Monitoring & Recovery division grew 1% in line with its market. Respiratory & Patient Monitoring as well as patient care and safety grew in the low single digits, with Nursing Care declining in the low single digits.","Respiratory and patient monitoring results were driven by growth in sensors and acute ventilators. Patient Care & Safety results were driven by strength in electrode sales, particularly in the U.S. While Nursing Care declined, it had strengthened in enteral feeding.","Now moving to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue grew 5% and encountered for 25% of the total company revenue. Results were driven by low 30s growth in Neurovascular and high single-digit growth in Surgical Technologies, with low single-digit growth in Neuromodulation flat results in Spine.","In Spine, our overall international sales grew 5% and Core Spine business grew 6%, which was significantly above the market. Spine had strong double-digit growth in Japan, in the Middle East and Africa and solid mid-single digit growth in Canada and Latin America.","Offsetting Core Spine's strong international performance was BMP, which had flat international sales in the quarter due to the impact of stop shipment in Europe. This issue is limited to our third-party manufacturing facility that only supply the European market. While the supplier has identified the remediation plan, we do expect to be off market for the remainder of the fiscal year, reducing our expected international BMP revenue by approximately $7 million per quarter.","In the U.S. Spine declined 2% and the Core Spine business declined 4% underperforming the market, which grew in the low single digits. We expect our U.S. Core Spine performance to improve as we realize the results from our recently realign RTG commercial sales management as well as the implementation of the surgical synergy programs that Omar mentioned earlier.","In addition, we expect Core Spine results to improvement as numerous recent and upcoming product launches reach scale, including our Elevate Expandable Cage and Solera Voyager System in thoracolumbar as well as our divergence standalone Divergence Stand-Alone Interbody Cage the ZEVO Anterior Cervical Plate System, the PRESTIGE LP Cervical Disc and ANATOMIC PTC interbody spacer in cervical. ","Turning to Neuromodulation, revenue increased 2%. We continue to face challenges in our drug pump business as a result of the FDA consent decree. The division had strong growth in deep brain stimulation driven by referral development, emerging market expansion and a commercial focus on surgical synergy, which combines Activa DBS implants with our peak surgery system, TYRX Antibacterial Envelope and O-arm imaging.","In Pain Stim, while we are facing competitive pressure, we are receiving good reception of our AdaptiveStim HD programming options.","In Gastro\/Uro, we continue to see solid growth of our InterStim System for bladder and bowel control and we expect the recently launched Verify Evaluation System to result in increased implants going forward.","In Surgical Technologies revenue grew 8%, driven by mid-teens growth in Advanced Energy, on strong sales of the peak surgery system and Aquamantys System.","ENT growth was driven by sales of the NuVent sinus balloon and a backorder release of the powered ENT blade. The Neurosurgery business also had a strong quarter, driven by the U.S. launch of the O-arm 2 surgical imaging system.","Our Neurovascular division had another strong performance in Q2, with revenue growth of 32%. Growth was driven by stent retrievers for treating acute ischemic stroke, where recent clinical data and AHA\/ASA stroke treatment guidelines are driving rapid adoption of our SOLITAIRE FR revascularization device.","The division also had very strong results in flow diversion, led by continued adoption with a Pipeline Flex device for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms.","During Q2, the Neurovascular division announced two technology acquisitions, Medina Medical with its this Aneurysm Embolization Mesh technology for hemorrhagic stroke, which we believe can disruptive the core market as well as Lazarus Effect and its mesh cover technology that is complementary to our SOLITAIRE stent retriever platform.","Now moving to diabetes group, revenue grew 11% and accounted for 6% of total company sales. The Intensive Insulin Management division grew in the mid-teens, including growth of nearly 40% in Europe as a result of strong sales of our MiniMed 640G insulin pump system with the enhanced Enlite CGM sensor","This next generation system features SmartGuard predictive low glucose management technology as well as a new insulin pump design featuring a full-color screen.","We continue to make progress in brining this technology to the U.S. as we have completed the clinical trials and are on track for early calendar 2016 submission to the FDA.","In our non-intensive diabetes therapies division, revenue doubled on strong sales of the iPro 2 professional CGM technology. In addition to professional CGM, the NDT division continues to focus on market access and integrated patient care solutions for people with Type 2 diabetes.","In our Diabetes Services and Solutions divisions, revenue grew in the mid-single digits, driven by strong growth in consumables, new Diabeter service revenue as well as sales from the recent launch of the MiniMed Connect. The uptake and user feedback on MiniMed Connect have been extremely positive and it is currently the highest rated connected glucose monitoring app in U.S.","We also continue to partner with IBM Watson, combining our clinical expertise, close loop algorithm development and CareLink data analytics with IBM's Watson Cloud and Watson Analytics and machine learning capabilities. In early pilot run, using the database of 100 randomized patients was able to predict some near-term hyperglycemic events, demonstrating the potential possibility of applying cognitive computing to support diabetes management.","Now turning to the P&L. As I discussed the operating items, it is worth clarifying again that my comments will be made on a non-GAAP comparable constant currency basis unless I say otherwise.","The Q2 operating margin was 28.4%, which excludes our 100-basis point negative impact from foreign currency and represented a 20-basis point improvement over the prior year. This operating margin improvement, included a 60-basis point improvement SG&A offset by 20-basis point decline in gross margin, a 5-basis point decline in R&D and a 20-basis point decline in that other expense. This resulted in operating profit growth of 6.4% or operating leverage of approximately 60 basis points over revenue growth.","In the coming quarters, we expect this leverage contribution to grow and be our majority contributed to our overall EPS leverage. In line with our expectations, the amount of Q2 operating leverage was lowered due to the difficult comparison against legacy Covidien's fiscal year end quarter, which included strong fiscal year in sales.","We estimate that the total benefit in the prior year was approximately $50 million on our operating profit line. Adjusting for this operating profit growth would have been approximately 9% in Q2, representing operating leverage of approximately 300 basis points.","Our operating margin included gross margins of 70.2% SG&A of 33.0% and R&D of 7.4%. Also included in our Q2 operating margin was net other expense of $57 million, which included net gains from our currency hedging program of $71 million.","We hedged majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility in our earnings from foreign-exchange. However, growing portion of our profits are unhedged, especially emerging market currencies, which can create modest volatility in our earnings.","Assuming recent exchange rates for the remainder of the fiscal year, which includes \u20ac1.06 and \u00a5123, we expect FY'16 net other expense to be in the range of $100 million to $130 million, which includes an expected impact for the U.S. medical device tax of approximately $210 million.","For Q3 FY'16, we expect net other expense to be in the range of $10 million in income to $10 million in expense based on the previously mentioned exchange rates.","We expect our operating margin for the second half of FY'16 to be in the range of 29% to 31% on an as reported basis, including 28% to 28.5% on an as reported basis in Q3. This forecast implies over 100-basis point improvement in our full fiscal year operating margin on a comparable constant currency basis, which on a reported basis is almost completely offset by a similar amount of negative FX based on current rates.","This strong operating margin improvement supports the significantly greater than 400 basis points in earnings per share leverage we intend to generate in the back half of the year, primarily a result of the Covidien cost synergy programs. We continue to expect these value capture programs to result in $300 million to $350 million in FY'16 savings and a minimum of $850 million by the end of FY'18, spread roughly equally across the three fiscal years.","Below the operating profit line, Q2 non-GAAP net interest expense was $172 million, which was an improvement to our forecast due to modest outperformance in certain investment income classes. Based on current rates, we would expect FY'16 net interest expense to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million, including $160 million to $180 million in Q3.","At the end of Q2, we had approximately $35.8 billion in debt and approximate $17.2 million in cash and investments of which approximately $6 billion was trapped. This cash mix is a significant improvement from prior quarters due to the $9.3 billion internal reorganization we executed in Q2 as part of our Covidien integration.","We expect to announce our strategy on how we intend to use these proceeds in the very near-term without likely focused on share repurchases and accelerated debt pay down while preserving financial flexibility. These potential actions are not contemplated in our current outlook.","Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis in Q2 was 16.5%, which was an improvement from our forecast as a result of operational tax adjustments and the allocation of profits among jurisdictions in which we operate.","On a full-year basis, we continue to expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate on a cash basis to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We expect to be at the higher end of this range until the presently expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated.","In Q2, free cash flow was $1.1 billion. We remain committed to returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow, excluding the cash impact of non-GAAP adjustments to shareholders and also continue to target an A credit profile.","In Q2, we paid $537 million in dividends and accelerated our share repurchase activity; repurchase $710 million of our ordinary shares.","As of the end of Q2, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately 90 million shares. Second quarter average daily shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.429 million shares. For FY'16, we now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximate 1.430 million shares, including approximate 1.427 million shares in Q3.","Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2016 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance.","We now expect revenue growth for the back half of the fiscal year to be in the upper half of our mid-single digits baseline range on a comparable constant currency basis. Our second half revenue outlook assumes that MITG grows in the low to mid single-digit, RTG grows in mid-single digits, CVG grows in the mid to high single-digit and Diabetes grows in the high-single to low-double digits.","While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact of exchange rates were to remain somewhat yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year then our full fiscal year '16 revenue will be negatively affected by approximately $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion, including a negative $330 million to $390 million impact in Q3.","Turning to guidance on the bottom-line, based on our first half performance, we now expect non-GAAP cash earnings per share in the range of $4.33 to $4.40, which includes an expect $0.45 to $0.50 negative foreign currency impact based on current exchange rates and approximately $300 million to $350 million of targeted value capture synergies from the Covidien acquisition.","As we look at the back half of our fiscal year, it is worth pointing out the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. R&D tax credit, which expired at the end of 2014, if Congress reacts actively renews the credit for 2015, we would see a $0.03 benefit in FY'16. Both, renewal and non-renewal scenarios are reflected in our earnings per share guidance.","While we do not give early earnings per share guidance, when looking at the gating earnings per share consensus, we would not be surprised to see approximately $0.04 $0.05 shifted from Q3 to Q4, which assumes that the R&D tax credit is renewed in Q3.","Finally, I want to point out that the updating historical Covidien-Medtronic financial presentations that Ryan mentioned earlier reflect lower FY'15 comparable earnings per share. However, this has no impact on our FY'16 expectation. As in the past, my comments on earnings per share guidance do not include any charges or gains that are recorded or would be recorded as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.","Before turning the call back over to Omar, I would like to note that we plan to hold our Q3 earnings call on March 1st and our Q4 earnings call on May 31st. In addition, we plan to host our Investor Day on June 6, which will be held again in New York City. Omar?","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Gary. Before opening lines for Q&A, I would like to reflect on our overall performance. Our team has come a long way, executing quarter-after-quarter. We are building a business with solid and diversified growth drivers, operational excellence, strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation, but it is also important for us to remember that we have a long journey ahead of us and our work of fulfilling the Medtronic machine goes on.","I am confident this team can execute consistently, balancing trade-offs and offsetting pressures to create long-term dependable value in healthcare.","With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I have asked Mike Coyle, President of our Cardiac and Vascular Group, Bryan Hanson President of our Minimally Invasive Therapies Group, Geoff Martha, President of Restorative Therapies Group and Hooman Hakami, President of our Diabetes Group to join us.","Where we are rarely able to get to everyone questions, so please limit yourself to only one question and only one follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor Relations team after the call.","Operator, first question please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.","Mike Weinstein","Good morning. Can you guys hear me okay?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. We can Mike.","Gary Ellis","Yes, Mike. Go ahead.","Mike Weinstein","Perfect. Well, first off congratulation on another nice quarter. Let me, Gary, just circle back on your commentary on repatriated cash. My first question is really, it sounds like there is some commentary fourth coming in terms of what are you going to do with that cash? Any reason you are not being more explicit today as in the comments you made about potentially accelerating share repurchase and paying down debt?","Gary Ellis","Yes, Mike. I mean, as we indicate in our comments, obviously, we are looking at this. We are excited about the opportunity that we are able to get access to this cash and make it available. We are looking at different options. As we indicated in our comments, obviously, the main focus of that will be, we did take on a lot of debt related to the transaction. We have commitment on the debt side that we want to look at, but obviously the other opportunity for us is to take a look at share repurchases and accelerate that as a potential.","We are looking at both, options we are evaluating that. We are having conversation with our Board. As we make decisions, once we make those decisions, then we will communicate what our plans are, but we just do not want to get ahead of ourselves in communicating before. Again, we have had a full dialogue and discussion with the board.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Let me ask you about a couple of different business that to me stood out this quarter. I mean, there is whole bunch them, but let me just target a couple of them.","Once, was your Diabetes business, and you commented on the growth you are seeing in diabetes, particularly Europe, where you have got some newer technologies available. Can you talk about the growth there number one.","Number two, your Neurovascular business continues to do extremely well. We are seeing that obviously because of the ischemic sort of trials and what is happening in that market, but could you just give us your own thought on sustainability and what you want to do with that business going forward?","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Mike, I am going to let Hooman and Jeff will answer this question, so Hooman why do not you go ahead with the questions.","Hooman Hakami","Sure. Hey, Mike. Yes. We saw great growth in Diabetes, 11% overall. The European growth was really, I think, something that stood out. We had just incredibly strong growth in 640. We saw that not only in Europe, but also in Asia Pacific and I think what it shows is that new innovation here matters and this is something that we are going to continue to drive.","We have got a plan to launch this product in the United States. You heard from the commentary that the trials was done and we are going to release it to the FDA in early 2016, so we are excited about that and I think what you are also seeing that I think it is worth noting is the 530G is doing incredibly well in the United States and we are seeing very, very good performance there on tough comps, so when you take a look at those two things. I think, we are seeing great performance within the group and we expect this to continue.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Geoff?","Geoff Martha","On the [ph] side it is a huge opportunity not just for Restorative Therapies Group, but for Medtronic. First of all you saw we did - these guys have done - our team and everybody has done a great job developing technologies and the clinical evidence and we want to maintain that leadership, so the two tuck-in acquisitions we did last quarter, I think, take our technologies roadmap out several years to maintain our leaderships there, so that is one.","Then two, we are looking at the broader stroke care continuum from diagnostics working with Mike Coyle's group here in the link technology into patient management and referrals systems, so we think beyond the technology if you look across the care continuum, there is several waves of innovation here and this is a top priority for not just my group, but for Medtronic.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. Then maybe just one question, and I will let others jump in. Omar, one of the questions we talked about last call, last call you remember I think industry was a little bit frustrated on the pace of margin improvement and part of it was tough to see because of the FX headwinds you guys were seeing.","One of the questions was the degree to which some of the Covidien synergies and effectively some of the upside to this synergy targets, Mike had reinvested back on the business versus shown down to the bottom-line to shareholders. If you want just give us your own updated thoughts on that and how investors should be kind of expecting Covidien synergies to play throughout the year?","Omar Ishrak","Yes. We have already said, as I said in my commentary they we are expecting some significant upside to 200-basis point to 400-basis point range and we will show that in the coming quarters.","That is where we stand. It is pretty straightforward. You know, most of these synergies will fall through and we will go from there, but I do not want to minimize our operational performance outside of the synergies as well, because there is good work going on in productivity improvements in our products and SG&A.","Some of it is using some of the new structures we are creating under the integration, but across the Board, we are delivering productivity and to the extent especially this year with the Covidien synergies, we really expect by the end of the year we will be above the range that we have talked about. As we have actually already done to a small extent in the first two quarters, but that amount will increase in the coming quarters.","Mike Weinstein","Perfect. Thank you, Omar.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley.","David Lewis","Good morning. Omar, I just wanted to come back to revenue for second. I think, your guidance for the upper end of 4 to 6 is consistently you said last quarter, but it is probably the most bullish component of the report this morning, so what is giving you the confidence in the acceleration sort of in the back half of the year? Not only it is the acceleration, because the comps get so dramatically harder as the anniversary the acceleration last year, so what gives you the confidence you still can sustain that momentum in the upper half of revenue in the back half as these comparables get harder.","Omar Ishrak","I think the direct answer there is our new product momentum. I do not think we have been in a position in this company today with the products we have already launched and the upcoming pipeline that we have across the Board in virtually every group.","The cadence of product innovation across the Board has increased significantly and when you sort of combine all of that together it makes quite a difference. That is our goal after all. We are in the end a technology company striving to sort of change outcomes.","Now, in addition to that, we are completely cognizant of the fact that one of our main growth strategies is to diversify the sources of growth, so we see emerging markets actually steadily improving into the back half of the year and services and solutions again starts to keep growing because of programs that we are implementing across the Board are gaining traction across multiple regions, so those are fairly slow. It takes a little time for them to come through, but in aggregate they do come through and they all contribute. When you add all of that up together, we feel pretty confident to be in the upper half of the range and again for this to be sustainable good years does not mean that the next year would be bad. It has to continue to improve, so that is the outlook that we have on this.","David Lewis","Okay. Very helpful, and I just had a quick follow-up for Gary and one for Geoff. Gary, our math implies 12% to 15% constant currency earnings in the back half of the year is an acceleration from the first half.","Does that jive with your math and how are you feeling about the $850 million number? Then for Geoff, I know it has not been very long that you have been at the helm on RTG, but I wonder if you could just briefly comment on the ability to achieve the type of network effects in RTG that have been so successful and accelerating Medtronic Cardio? Thank you.","Gary Ellis","David, to your first comment about earnings per share, the answer on the constant currency would be yes. That is what we would expect to see in the back half of the year. That is not - if you look at the first half of the year, basically we have seen between 11% and 12% kind of constant currency comparable growth overall, so we expect that to accelerate a little bit in the back half of the year as we talked about primarily because of more of the benefits of the Covidien integration and all the integration efforts coming through, so total related to the $850 million commitment that we have move to by FY'18, we are right in line. In fact, maybe slightly ahead of our plans to deliver $300 million and $350 million in the current year and right in line with the expectations on doing that for the full 850 by FY'18, so we feel very confident about that. We feel confident about that in our earnings per share guidance we are providing to the organization or to the investors, but in general yes that is right in line with our expectations but foreign-exchange does continue to be a negative headwind for us obviously, but on a comparable constant currency basis, we are seeing an acceleration in our growth.","Omar Ishrak","Geoff?","Geoff Martha","David, again, good question. I would answer it - three parts to the answer. One, from a market perspective, one thing that has helped the cardiovascular space is the emergence of the cardiovascular service line globally and we are seeing that not to the same effect yet. It is, I do not know 10-plus years behind as the neuro services line Neuroscience service lines emerge, but we are definitely seeing that trends emerge. The more that happens, the more it plays to our hand, because we have by far the best breadth to cover those Neuroscience service line, so that is one and that is a tailwind for us.","The second is our internal capabilities of taking and this is different than actually cardiovascular. We have implants that work with Intraoperative Imaging and Navigation and we have both platforms and that gives us some flexibility. Now, we have to integrate those better and take them to market selling benefits versus features and we are working on that, but that is another tailwind and the Intraoperative Imaging navigation is a key driver to us getting this network effect so that we sell, like I said, solutions versus the features.","Then thirdly, which we are copying the playbook from our Cardiovascular Group is changing the way our operating principles and our operating mechanisms, so that our business is - the silos come down to a certain extent and they are incented to drive these cross business unit deals where it make sense, so when you are bundling, if you will, intraoperative navigation and Intraoperative Imaging navigation with some of our implants. You need to have the incentives and the operating mechanisms and analytics to do that, so we are in the process of doing that, so those three things are the things that are driving it, but one thing that is gating it is the Neuroscience service line evolution in the marketplace.","David Lewis","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs.","David Roman","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Omar, I was hoping if you go back to one of the things you referenced in your prepared remarks towards the contribution from new products I thinking above the sort of historical level or your target levels. Can you just sort of talk about what specifically influenced that and why that would not translate into better overall top-line growth? Is there any part of the new product story that has all cannibalistic of the base business or something that is happening in the end market that we would not have let that 400-plus basis points to new product to drive better overall top-line growth and that is obviously now throw any water on the resulting, but just for some perspective?","Omar Ishrak","Well, a number of things. First of all, the new product growth includes the baseline product lines, so that inclusive of all of that. The only answer if we do the math is that the emerging markets and service and solution have to pickup. Remember, service and solutions because of the integration together with the Covidien, the baseline has changed, so therefore it is a 20 basis points where our number is like 40 to 60, so that is one aspect that will drag it down. Those numbers are small, but in the context of which you are talking about, you are talking about the ranges of the upper end here, so we are talking about 10s of basis points rather than and 100s, so they do make a difference.","Then emerging markets also, as we climbed up into the range, probably will help. Outside of that it is a matter of how much above the 350 we actually get. Again, like I have said before, we just want to be a little cautions not so much because of our product launch activities but because of the environment around us, which you just never know, we just have a little cautious about macroeconomic pressures, political instabilities, those things or some healthcare rule changes, so we have given up passed experience of these things surprising us. We just got to be a little cautions, so that is really the best way I can answer this that I would really like to see all three of our growth vectors above our projections before we really confident that we can extend the range so that we get that level of diversification, but in nowhere am I any sort of less confident about our new products execution just because of the breadth of our pipeline I think that is going to happen.","I just think the macroeconomic circumstances we just want to be a little cautious about that and therefore I want to see the other growth vectors also climb with the same range before we can get more bullish.","David Roman","Okay. That is helpful. Maybe just a follow-up for Gary on the P&L and cash flow side, as we think about the sort of underlying operating profit of the business, obviously FY'16 is sort of a tail to have as we think the sort of normalized run rate of the business so we think about that 30% number that you are talking about exiting the year sort of that the right underlying profit of the business off of which to think about forward forecast. Then on the free cash flow side, the $1.1 billion you are talking about this quarter, if you annualized that that is pretty close to what you were as an independent company pre Covidien, so when do we start to see the benefit flow through to free cash flow and move toward that. That is your number target you put out therefore for FY 19?","Gary Ellis","Well, with respect to of the profit margin, I mean, you cannot take our Q4 number and annualized that because as you look historically the same way that you had with Covidien that we just talked about as far as the tough comparison. Our Q4, the profit margin is always much, much higher than the previous three quarters. That is historical, because we have a strong closing and so you have a lower rate. We cannot annualized the fourth quarter, but obviously we are in the 20% 29% range for the full-year that we have been talking about then we would obviously continue to build on that number, so that is kind of the - you take the average for the year and then build on that standpoint of the incremental improvements we will see from value capture going forward is what you should assume, but my only point is just do not take the fourth quarter annualized, because that it unusual it spite by the low-end the best profit operating margin tends to be in the fourth quarter, but we would obviously could expected to continue to improve.","The cash flow in the quarter, $1.1 billion includes some restructuring cost resurgence stuff like that, so we pulled that out. You are closer to the $1.3 billion and the point if you looked historically Medtronic and Covidien, the cash flow also similar to the profits rose as we go through the year, so it is always actually that $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion about 40% to 50% versus where Medtronic, Inc. itself was a year going into the quarter, we would expect still for the current year that we are going to be somewhere around $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow and similar to what we talk about on the profit to the cash flow also improve in the back half of the year, which is normal because we are first half of the year we are paying off bonuses and things like that in the prior year in the cash flow just it spite historical nature is just lower, but in the back half of that will accelerate so we are still very confident that for the current you will be in that $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion and similar to what we have talking about our earnings growing close to double digits on that cash flow going forward over the next several years and generating as we talked about close to $40 billion in free cash flow over the next five years. We are still very confident about that.","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.","Larry Biegelsen","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with the Puerto Rico our tax issue. I think in September at our conference you said there would be a briefing in October did that happen and do you still expected the decision in late fiscal 2016. I think in the past you said most of these cases settle before decision. Do you still feel that it settlement it is more likely here as well and had upon? Thanks.","Gary Ellis","Well, I mean as far as the trial process, yes. There is a process where there is some briefing that had to be provided by both parties like the government and Medtronic that occurred I believe in October. That is all been done from what I understand and now we are in a situation is and the judges per view the judge has the option to take as long as sheets would you like in those case.","We are assuming that at the end of our fiscal 2016 early into FY'17 is what she will make sure make a decision, but it can go longer too. This is her decision on how quickly she moves in making that decision.","As far as settlement discussions, again, I cannot say anything on that, because obviously settlement discussions required two parties to come together and at the point of time, I cannot say anything about that at all. I mean you get happens to happens that in the mean time we are just waiting to see what the decision is from the court case.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks. Then on emerging markets Omar, you bounce back this quarter plus 11% and based on your earlier comments it sounds like you expect that to - I just want it to be clear. It sounds like you expect that actually improved in the second half and I am asking, because we do look across medtech emerging market growth does not appear to have slowed so I just wanted to be clear that you think you can kind of in the second half of this year build off of the 11% and actually accelerate and is that mid-teens growth that you have talked about in the past so realistic? Thanks for taking the questions.","Omar Ishrak","Yes. First, yes, we expect this growth to increased, the words I would you like to use and then I think I used in the commentary was that we would like to see steady increase and improved consistency, so I do not want this to like bounce back and forth between '15 and whatever. This things has to go steadily and our diversification across the emerging markets helps with that and I think we will see that I think the mid-teens goal is completely realistic over a period of time and that is what were aiming to get through the market opportunity is massive and it is really up to us to execute our variety of strategies and get the benefits from them, so in short, I expect this to steadily improved quarter-after-quarter.","Larry Biegelsen","Thanks for taking the questions guys.","Omar Ishrak","Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.","Bob Hopkins","Thanks. Can you hear me okay?","Omar Ishrak","Yes.","Bob Hopkins","Great. Good morning. A couple of quick things, first, for Gary the synergy that particular $300 million to $350 million for this year. Can you just give us a sense as to how much has been realized here in the first half and also Gary if you would mind just walking through a little more detail why you think the streets sort of needs to shift a little bit from in terms of earnings from Q3 to Q4?","Gary Ellis","Well, as far as the synergy number of the $300 million to $350 million, I would say right now we probably have already achieved about 40% of that the 35% to 40% has already been incurred. We have indicated previously that a bigger portion would be in the back half of the year and that is kind of what we are still expecting, so I would expect that 60%-plus of the benefit will at the back half of the year so. We are right in line with our plans and our targets the back slightly ahead of where they are at but approximately 40 % we have already realized up to this point.","With respect to the guidance just as far as taking look at the quarters and stop, all we are looking If you look historically, our Q2 and Q3 historically both revenue and bottom line are relatively consistent and there is not a big change overall between those two and we did a $3 here in the current quarter. We are assuming that there will be an R&D tax credit. There is a benefit for in the third quarter, so overall I would get you more in the $5 to $6 range and all we are saying is, that versus where the street it is at I think it is a bit higher than that number.","On the other hand I would tell you I think the street loan lower in Q4 versus what we would have historically see as far as an uplift. So our saying is if you look at our historical modeling Q2, Q3 are usually relatively consistent and it is Q4 where you sees a big jump I think there has been two much way we put in Q3 right now and but again these are your models you guys can put together how you like, but that's if you look at history I think you are going to see that you are a little lit bit probably lower high in Q3.","Bob Hopkins","Then for Mike and Omar and thanks for that Gary, can you guys just put in perspective the MRI safe ICD launch in the United States. Maybe relative to the MRI safe pacer launch how just how should we think about this launch in terms of the ability this product to take share or you are the only one in the market with such a product and then Omar I was wonder if you could just give some broad thoughts on kind of the state of Medtech right now in terms of what you are seeing across your businesses in terms of your surgical procedure volumes pricing just kind of a broad look at the current point of time if you do not mind?","Omar Ishrak","Okay. Mike do you want to go first?","Mike Coyle","Yes. Bob maybe the best way to think about is just some statistics around mix, right, if you look at dual chamber pacemakers right now. Probably two-thirds of our product is MRI safe as we sell into initial implants - and with the recently, two quarters ago we launched the single chamber. We are probably now up to somewhere around 40% mix in single-chamber for MRI safe and we just launched the MRI safe ICD and our mix in the quarter would be probably somewhere around 20% so there is still a lot of room to run there.","Obviously, we have not yet released the MRI safe CRT-D which we expected to do by the end of the year. So I think that might give you some sense of sort of how we see the mixed change taking place within our business.","Omar Ishrak","With respect to the overall medtech market, look we have had a - the medtech industries has actually had a pretty good year and I think a lot of that is you look knowledge is driven by U.S. growth so U.S. has been stronger than I can remember for a long time and that is not only the medtech sort of companies but also hospitals. Now as we going to sort of calendar year '16, there will be some anniversarying that is happening and also some of the hospitals have reported slightly sort of lower growth rates, so we are watching this carefully.","I do not know to what extent the procedure growth will continue at the same rate of growth. I do not think it will slowdown, per se, but the growth rate might well slowdown. So that is what we are watching very carefully and I think coming after the next couple of months it is pretty crucial to see how procedures go, but again really at the end of the day this is a U.S story and to a certain degree emerging markets Medtech has been resilient in the emerging markets compared to other industries simply because of the nature of the industry itself that governments continuing to invest there so that has been reach the bottom really has not fallen out that all and although I think we have our performed the overall market into the market in general it has been pretty resilient. So those things holding U.S. growth is what has driven the medtech industry. I think U.S. growth will anniversary probably steady a little bit.","On the other hand, medtech in emerging markets might well start to improve I mean I do not know. I know our projections are that we will start to improve overall we will have to see, hope that helps.","Bob Hopkins","Thank you very much. Thank you.","Gary Ellis","We have time for one more question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen & Company.","Josh Jennings","Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Just wanted to, Omar, start with first one is although it is relatively early since the close of the Covidien transaction, you have had three quarters of combined entity experience and just wondering how you are evaluating the entire product portfolio and whether or not you feel like you have increased flexibility now that pruning the portfolio or weed out lower growth, lower margin products and business units and whether we should be expecting that?","Omar Ishrak","I think I kind of alluded to that a little bit. First of all, since the acquisition, we have set up Minimally Invasive Therapies Group under Brian. Brain and his team are really charted, a very clear and compelling vision for the future, which is outcomes-based and very aligned with the Medtronic mission, so that was the first step and I think I talked about the four areas of focus within MITG.","Now we are looking at the entire range of assets that we have within MITG and kind of assessing that against the strategy and as we go through that process which were in the middle of doing in the next 6 months or so, we will take action as is necessary, but that is the way in which we are gauging it. So the first step was to kind of decide clearly and get full sort of excitement with the team and agreement with the team that this is where we should go which I think the team is put in place and understand with the core product technologies are that drive that and solutions that are necessary for that.","Next is to look at the breadth of everything else and see what fits and what doesn\u2019t. I mean somethings clearly do not and we\u2019ll have to see how we monetize those assets as we move forward, but by and large that is the way in which we are looking at this.","Josh Jennings","Great. Then just follow-up for Omar and Gary, any updated views on potential revenue synergies outside of peripheral neurovascular? Thanks a lot gentleman.","Gary Ellis","Look, that is an area that is pretty active I mean one thing that you just try about was the in stroke were the linked our product feeding into the stroke care and vascular channel is one that is pretty high in our list.","I can tell you that as a business, as a leadership team we work to figure out methodologies where internally we can have our selling groups of multiple products and do it in a way that is scalable unsustainable and then in an organized way around the world I think that first step was pretty important. So that area certainly is a big sort of enabler for us to move products around various sales channels and we have done that and we will have to see how these things go forward but there is a lot discussion between sales team using those principles without getting distracted from their main focus as to how accelerate their growth. So we are optimistic that we will start to see those but the specifics of those right now are still sort of being generated.","The other area that I will point is the translation of the operating room managed services from Cath Lab I mean that is a big step for us and the acceleration there is pretty exciting. As you can see, like I said we have already closed six of those deals $140 million in cumulative revenue that is much faster than anything that Covidien was originally planning for and we are only beginning there, so those are the ways in which we are looking at this right now.","Over time, we are creating a structure where we can use the combined nature and assets of our company to address many different problems both, from a technology perspective and from a comorbidity perspective, which would be an increasing problem in healthcare where we think we have the breadth of assets that we can address very effectively.","Okay. With that thank you all very much for your questions and on behalf of the entire Management team I would like to thank you again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q3 call in March 1.","Thank you and all of you please have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
