My name is Kevin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded today, Thursday, February 4. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty's Senior Vice President, Treasurer & and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, please go ahead.","Kevin Monaco - Treasurer, Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Bart Becht, Chairman and Interim CEO; and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. All discussions of net revenues are on a like-for-like basis. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations do not reflect certain non-recurring and other charges. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Bart.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin. This morning, we'll provide you with a brief update on the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business, other corporate developments, and Q2 and year-to-date results. Then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions.","Our efforts right now are all about creating a very healthy platform for Coty to become the strong leader and challenger in the beauty industry that we aim for it to be. This quarter we made good progress on that objective both from the merger acquisition front and the underlying Coty business site. Starting with the core Coty business, Q2 showed continued improvements in business fundamentals. Coty revenue trends remain muted with a 1% like-for-like decline and we do expect the Q2 trend to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year as we continue to rationalize non-strategic product lines and businesses.","However, and encouragingly, power brands experienced solid mid single-digit growth in the second quarter very much held by our strategy of focusing and investing in these key brands. We also continue to show strong momentum in driving profit and cash flow generation. Our year-to-date operating profit grew high single-digits with adjusted operating income growing 13% at constant currency and impressive growth in operating margin.","At the same time, our strong net working capital improvement contributed to significant growth in free cash flow generation. These results show that we can continue to build a healthier and better business, despite subdued revenue growth performance. On the merger and acquisition side we've made good progress on our Bourjois acquisition. As of today, the local Bourjois businesses have been integrated within Coty local subsidiaries. Also, Bourjois and Coty processes as well as the information technology are now fully aligned. We continue to see good growth opportunities for this brand and remain confident that it will be margin accretive to our color business in fiscal 2017.","Since announcing the acquisition of Beamly in the second quarter these top quality leaders in this digital marketing company have started to engage and work with the Coty brands on several digital campaigns. We are confident by bringing in Beamly's cutting edge digital engagement platform in-house, we will continue to strengthen Coty's marketing and branding efforts.","In addition, we announced on February 1, the completion of the acquisition of the Hypermarcas' Beauty & Personal Care business. As a reminder, Hypermarcas is a highly-profitable business with operating margins above Coty levels. This transaction will strengthen Coty's exposure to Brazil, which is one of the largest and growing Beauty markets in the world. We believe it will also provide an excellent platform to integrate the existing small Coty business and the sizable P&G Specialty Beauty Business in Brazil.","And as announced last week, we signed a new fragrance license agreement with Tiffany & Co., an internationally renowned jeweler, which we believe will further strengthen our future position as the industry leader in fragrances. On the P&G Specialty Beauty business merger, we confirmed the transfer of 10 P&G fragrance licenses, including global powerhouses such as Hugo Boss, Gucci and Lacoste.","We are making excellent progress to close the P&G Specialty Beauty Business merger in the second half of calendar 2016 and we are happy to report that we have received antitrust approval from the U.S., among other countries and we are actively engaged in discussions with the EU antitrust authorities. We have also materially advanced on structuring and staffing our future organization and are well advanced in setting up the teams and work stream supporting our IT system requirements and blueprinting the integration plans for the combined businesses.","And as I discussed on the last call, we believe the new consumer-centric and category-focused organizational structure, our strong brand portfolio, together with our new leadership team will position Coty well to realize its ambition of becoming a true leader and challenger in the Beauty industry and drive profitable growth and shareholder value overtime.","I will now hand over the call to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bart, and good morning everyone. Total Q2 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like with an improvement in the Fragrance segment trends compared to Q1, and the solid Color Cosmetics segment growth was in spite of the decline in the U.S. main markets. I'm happy to report that fiscal year-to-date, the adjusted gross margin increase a very strong 130 basis points to 60.9%, reflecting our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies and reducing discounting activity.","We keep on building a better business, even in the face of soft top line trends, with adjusted operating income growing 5% fiscal year-to-date, with a much more substantial 13% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin at actual rates grew 160 basis points, with meaningful margin increase in Color Cosmetics, up 330 basis points, and Skin & Body Care, up 420 basis points. The Fragrance segment margin increased 20 basis points to 20.2%.","As we discussed on the last call, given the market conditions and our global footprints, FX continue to pressure our revenues and operating income. Fiscal year-to-date, FX lowered net revenues and operating income by over 600 basis points. Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $0.98 compared to $0.73 in the prior year, reflecting in part the benefit from the favorable tax settlement of $113.3 million this year, compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior period.","Our Global Efficiency Program remains on track, as we have recognized cumulative savings of approximately $170 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, driven by fixed cost reduction in direct procurement savings, footprint consolidation and more streamlined operations in China. As a reminder, we expect to generate savings of approximately $270 million through fiscal 2017.","On the balance sheet, as a reminder, we closed on a $4.5 billion credit facility this quarter to refinance existing Coty debts with new borrowings subject to longer maturities. As of today, we have swapped approximately 40% of our outstanding net floating rates debt into fixed rates at an all-in-cost below 3%, with an average maturities between three years and five years. In addition, certain lenders have committed to loan up to $4.5 billion to an affiliate of P&G, which is expected to be conveyed to Coty in connection with the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty business.","With regard to the merger, the initial filing of our registration statement in connection with the transaction is expected to be filed in April. This registration document will include historical financial information for the beauty brands we are acquiring from P&G through December 31, 2015. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives. I'm very happy to report that fiscal year-to-date, we generated $517.1 million in operating cash flow, and $438.7 million in free cash flow, each up over $160 million versus the prior year.","Supported by this strong cash flow generation, we completed our $700 million share buyback program during the second quarter. In total this fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 26 million Class A shares and we also returned almost $90 million of cash to shareholders as dividends. We also announced this morning that the board has authorized an incremental $500 million of share repurchase program. We will remain opportunistic in the way we use this authorization. It further supports our commitment to return cash to shareholder.","Finally, on Feb 1, we completed the acquisition of Hypermarcas' Beauty & Personal Care Business, which we believe, as Bart said, will be a great platform to integrate our current and future business in Brazil. We are very excited to expand our footprint in Brazil with this portfolio of leading brands. The execution of the Bourjois acquisition in line with our expectations, as well as the timely closing of the Hypermarcas' acquisition, demonstrate our ability to successfully execute on our M&A growth strategy.","Thank you. I will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Can you just comment about some of the disclosures and P&G filings? I looked at their last 10-Q, and it shows some like pretty sharp declines in both sales and profits in some of the acquired brands. So I just love some colors around, how much currency impacted that, maybe some of the brands that P&G closed that aren't being transferred that might be in there, any color would be appreciated?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, thanks for the question, Bill. So, while we cannot comment on the disclosure or performance of the business that are not today a part of Coty, we do want to highlight a couple of points. So first, it is our understanding that the disclosure in the public filings you referenced reflects the sales and profitability of the 47 brands that were part of the P&G's portfolio and now classified as discontinued operation, rather than the 41 brands that Coty will be acquiring as part of the planned merger. So four of the 47 brands have already been sold or discontinued by P&G. Second, we also understand the negative FX impact accounted for a very substantial component of the reported decline in the sales of these 47 brands. Third, we also understand that the organic growth rate of the 41 brands we are acquiring is in line with the like-for-like trends that we are seeing in the Coty business both for Q2 fiscal 2016 and year-to-date. So I think this gives you a little bit more perspective and color around the disclosure.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That's great. And then, can you just talk about the Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera licenses sort of \u2013 how big are they? Is there going to be like a purchase price adjustment? Does it power your moves (12:57), anything you guys can provide in a public context would also be appreciated?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're not going to basically disclose that. I think it would be much better is to wait for the S-4 filing, which will happen in the second half of April because that will really provide, the total scope of the business as we will be acquiring with all the financial details. And then, shortly after this disclosure, we'll provide an update also in terms of our financial perspective around the deal dynamics, but I would say to have a discussion just about Dolce & Gabbana today, we don't really think is appropriate. I think it would be much better handled when we have all the facts on the table, and then have a discussion about what we believe the deal will do for Coty going forward. So that all should happen end April, latest early May.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, okay.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","To build on that, on the potential adjustment so as per the transaction agreement, we assume debt from the P&G Specialty Beauty Business will be adjusted downward to reflect the fact that 10 out of the 12 available licenses, subject to regulatory approval, are transferred on all the 12. This downward debt adjustment will be based using a specific and contractually pre-agreed formula that we will disclose at a later date.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on the SKU and brand rationalization. Can you just talk about how far along you are on that process and what the impact was, both in the quarter and year-to-date on organic growth if you have it?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yes, so this will be an ongoing process and it will be reviewed again as part of \u2013 the P&G merger, because then clearly we won't have an enlarged portfolio and we're going to have again reflect in terms of how we deal with the brand portfolio post merger. So when I say rationalization of the portfolio, really referring to several items. First there is a rationalization of very small brands, which is in the detail of the portfolio. But there is also a discontinuation of certain lines \u2013 business lines or product lines of brands, in particular, when they're in places where we don't want to really see them. I can give you a classic example, selling OPI nail polish in hardware stores is probably not the smartest idea we could do as a company which is passionate about beauty. And so there is also a rationalization of some businesses in locations where it shouldn't be. So it is both basically a rationalization of small brands and taking out kind of like business situations and to clean that up. And that is an ongoing effort which will not stop, in this quarter or the next quarter and will continue post merger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning, thank you. I want to talk about the sequential improvement in the power brands and then sort of what necessarily do you think is driving that? How sustainable? Is it more of a stabilization or is it something where you could see it getting better and better as we go through? And then a second question on the cash flow, which is the working capital. It appears to be coming a lot from working capital, I think, in particular, payables were better than what we had anticipated and sort of okay. Is that a new level and should we continue to see further improvement in working capital? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So clearly on power brands, as you all know, our strategy is very much to continue to focus and invest in these brands behind key innovations and that's clearly what you're seeing in the second quarter. Having said that, there also is an impact in terms of phasing of launches. As you all know, in the beauty business, but in particular in the fragrance side of the business, which is a substantial chunk of Coty, launch timings around fragrances substantially impact the growth trends. So last year, we had a big launch around Calvin Klein in the first quarter, which we didn't have this year. At least we didn't have the same size of innovation. Having said that, on the other side, Marc Jacobs' Decadence very much hits the second quarter. So you are always going to see some fluctuation in the growth rate on the power brands. Having said that, clearly we are very hopeful that we will continue to grow our power brands, in particular, as we rationalize a lot of the businesses outside of the power brands.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So on the working capital, John, as you know I'm coming from a company who is familiar with negative working capital and we're not yet there. So we need to continue on that journey. This being said, it is true that the payables have been the biggest component in the improvement so far. I think there is still some room for improvement in the payables. Now, what we really need to tackle is for the GSO. There is some room for improvement in a couple of regions. And second, on a more fundamental basis, the inventory level. And this is, as you know, more long-term process, which is really about forecast accuracy, rationalization of the portfolio that will definitely help in that regard. So that's more on the long-term. But we're not yet at zero working capital. We are becoming within reach of that target, but we're not yet there. And I think there is going to be some further improvement.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you walk through on sort of what contributed to the gross margin expansion in the quarter? How sustainable that is? Is it just cost savings? Is it more favorable mix, that kind of stuff? Because I was obviously pretty impressed. Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So the gross margin improvement is very sustainable in the sense that it's mainly coming from supply chain. And as you know, we have embarked into a productivity program three years ago and we have, on an annual basis, steady improvement from the supply chain. It's coming from procurement savings, first. It's also coming from rationalization of the footprint and consolidation of the footprint that we continue to do. So these are very sustainable gross margin improvement. On top of that there are $2 billion sitting between gross sales and net sales and we are starting to tackle that with some ROI measurements. This is a long-term process and we are really working on that, and I think there have been some improvement in that regard also.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And net GAAP is promotions and that kind of stuff, put it principally?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Can you say that again?","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","The GAAP between the gross sales and the net sales is promotions and discounting and gift repurchase and that kind of stuff?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No, there are basically historical discounts which have been agreed with retailers. So it's always a combination of different buckets, and as you all know, even the discount structure depends very much on a country-by-country basis. It's not the same across the globe.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So there are promotional discounts in there. There are year-end rebates in there. There are contractual arrangements with retailers in there, so it's a variety basically of different components and even across the countries that would have to discuss and with you country-by-country, simply the structure differs. If you're interested, we can have a discussion about this at some point in time, but it is a quite involved discussion.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And is it fair to say the power brands generally are higher gross margin or is there more discounting that goes on with those power brands because they are growing faster and they require more investment?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","I would say, on average, the power brands are \u2013 it depends. It's not consistent across the power brands. Some of them definitely are higher margin, but there are also a few which are slightly lower margin than the average, so it's not basically a consistent picture across, not at this stage.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay, thanks very much. Bye.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks, and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask a clarifying question of the Hypermarcas deal. So when you announced it, I believe it was R$3.8 billion. When it closed earlier this week, you had said in the release it was R$3.5 billion. I guess I'm curious, was there anything to the adjustment there in terms of net piece as (21:53) working capital, debt adjustments whatever?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So yes, indeed that you are right. There was some adjustment mechanism based on the working capital, and this is the reason why we had this adjustment.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it, okay. And then, back on the debt adjustment for the Procter deal. And I appreciate you're not wanting to talk about it, but is it fair to assume basically that, when we're trying to adjust for, before seeing the S-4, the pre agreed-to multiple that the business would be worth, basically would get backed out, whatever that is per the disclosures, as a reflection of anticipated EBITDA? So basically, if we're all doing the math, take what we think would be the EBITDA piece, use that multiple, whatever it is and then just sort of back that number out of the debt. Is that basically it, or are there any other moving parts to it?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No, we're not going to comment on that today. We'll have another session on all the financials end of April, early May and then a lot of the stuff will be clarified. Even at that point in time, there's still going to have to be discussion if we're going to disclose the adjustment formula, because \u2013 that impacts, to some extent, the ability what happens to this brand on the P&G side. So we would have to get their agreement to disclose this. So \u2013 but we'll be very clear from the S-4, which I think is what you'll all be looking for is, what is the scope and what is the structure \u2013 the financial structure of this business.","So, I think you all will be very happy when you see all this data. And I think the second part that you're going to get shortly thereafter is our perspective of what the financial impact is of combining the two businesses, which I think also will be what you're looking for. The one thing which I'm not sure we will have at that point in time, and I'm not saying we will not have it, but I just cannot tell you today, is the adjustment formula for the Dolce & Gabbana business not coming to us, because that's something which would have to be agreed with P&G.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, more of a holistic sort of longer-term question. Given time to close for the P&G deal Hypermarcas closing, it seems fairly quickly. Discuss the ability for the business to really hit the ground running on NewCo, on Coty plus P&G assets, with a specific sort of view on how quickly you can be back in the market to use the free cash flow to do more deals?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Before we start talking about more deals. As you know, we have a few basically to execute at the moment. So I'm going to refrain from commenting on new deals. The Hypermarcas business is really a critical business enabler, both basically in the P&G transaction, as well as to establish a long-term interesting business in Brazil. And the reason for that is very, very straightforward. The Coty business is very, very small and therefore has a very sub critical mass infrastructure. The P&G business is a carve-out and, as a result, has very much of a sub critical mass infrastructure.","Just to give you some perspective, the P&G transaction in Brazil would have come with one sales person. I don't have to tell you that that's not good enough to run a Brazilian business. So the Hypermarcas organization is a full-fledged infrastructure business. It has everything. It has a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and logistics infrastructure. It has also state-of-the-art, basically, go-to-market infrastructure, and a management team which has proven to be successful in the market from a market share point of view. So as we speak, we're starting to integrate the Coty business into Hypermarcas and then, once that's done, they will get ready to integrate the P&G business.","So Hypermarcas is really the main body that is going to be used in order to integrate and the Coty business and the P&G business, rather than \u2013 Hypermarcas is not integrated in Coty really, Coty is being integrated into Hypermarcas. Clearly it gets renamed Coty, but \u2013 just to be crystal clear, from a critical mass point of view, that's where the point of gravity lies, and that's very much of an enabler to get the deals done, as well as to have a healthy business platform going forward.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Just a follow-up on the Hypermarcas conversation. Bart, do you have a way of framing it for us? Like, how \u2013 to what degree do you think this accelerates your vision of what the business will look like in Brazil? Like, is it a three-year accelerator by having the Hypermarcas piece of what Procter, Beauty plus Coty could have been on its own?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","I would say it is main accelerator. In markets like Brazil, if you don't have your own manufacturing infrastructure, and your own go-to-market infrastructure, it is very difficult to be successful as the major multinational company, because you cannot basically work with third-parties in these two areas. So it is a massive accelerator. The fact that Coty doesn't have its own manufacturing infrastructure and has a substandard go-to-market infrastructure. The fact that the P&G business does not really have a local manufacturing infrastructure, post deal, and doesn't really have a good go-to-market infrastructure is seriously handicapping just taking over the P&G business. So it really is a massive accelerator for us.","The other good thing about Hypermarcas is, it's a proven management team, they are gaining share as we speak in practically every category that they operate and so I genuinely believe that this is a massive accelerator for us to be successful not in the long-term, even in the medium-term in Brazil. Clearly, the first job is to absorb Coty and then the P&G business, that's the first job. But then shortly thereafter, I would hope that we're going to see an acceleration in terms of the whole platform.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Could you also share, I think some people have questioned, just given the movement in the real, I guess the purchase price and what one pays for emerging market, let alone Brazilian assets currently, and current market growth rate. So if you could just share your perspective on the timing and the macro environment, that would be really helpful too?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So first in terms of financing of this acquisition, so it was financed with cash on hand and the existing debt facilities that we have. It was financed in dollar, but paid in Brazilian real and it is clear that we have hedged the vast majority of the price at the time of signature. So I think now \u2013 so that's the first part of the question. On the second part of the question, the way we think about it, it is really long-term. And so clearly, this is a great asset. It significantly is the merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty business as Bart said. It provides the right platform from a go-to-market capability, from a manufacturing capability. I think we are not ready yet to share the synergies, but in terms of one-off cost and CapEx, it is a significant enabler into the transaction. So we will be able to cost operate (29:52) with the goods already in Brazil, which significantly helps. So I think you need to think about it from a most strategic standpoint and more long-term standpoint. Brazil is one of the key market, it's the third biggest beauty market in the world. It is the first biggest Fragrance market in the world and it's a more long-term view.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks. And then just on one last question on the current Coty business. Drawing down promotional activity a little bit, I thought it was interesting that the Fragrance business, rate of decline was a little bit less bad (30:32) than I had expected. And that's notable particularly that you were pulling back on promotions during the holiday season. So could you comment on the overall, kind of market degree of promotional activity if you felt like there was any kind of following going on in the marketplace, you becoming a little bit more rational, or if it's just frankly that your businesses did just fine with a little bit less promotional support that you had expected?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think \u2013 so, first in terms of growth rate on the Fragrance business, clearly there was a differential phasing between the two years in the terms of the key launches, like I said before, which had an impact on Q2 relative to Q1. In terms of promotional activity, I would say the overall business is starting to get gradually better at managing gross to net. By the way, I'm going to retract this number which Patrice mentioned before of the $2 billion because it is not entirely correct. But, I would say the key thing is how to manage gross to net. I think overall the business is getting better at it. And that makes, I would say in the general market environment nothing has really changed. We've just gotten slightly better at it than we did before. And so you see that reflected in the P&L. So, market is not more rational, it is very similar. We just got slightly better at it.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, good morning, everyone. I'd just like to follow-up on Lauren's earlier question just with respect to the health of the mass channel globally, if you can just talk a little bit about some of the focus that the retailers have been placing on the beauty category, if you expect that to continue here into 2016? And then, just secondly with respect to the Beamly acquisition, just talk a little bit about what we should be looking for in terms of digital engagement or some of the initiatives that you have planned around some of your core brands and what we should be looking for with respect to some of the digital improvements? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say, mass basically development is very different by subcategory between fragrance, color and skin care. So, as we all know, in the United States in particular, in fragrance, most of the growth is in the procedure and is not in the mass area and in part is that because of the way mass basically in particular behaves in this category. So, I think it's more of a channel issue than anything else. So overall, there it's not doing a great job. In Color Cosmetics, it's very different, so it very much differs by segment, it's not the same. Mass continues to do well in Color Cosmetics, does not do very well in Fragrance. Retailer's focus on beauty business, clearly, that depends on what retailer you talk about. Some retailers getting increasingly better at it, for instance, the drug trade in the U.S. Some drug retailers are doing a substantially better business than they did before on the overall beauty business.","Digital engagement on core brands. Digital \u2013 we are in a phase where we're trying to transform the business to enter the digital world as accepting it that it is a core component of the entire business. As much as everybody accepts that television in addition to print and radio is a normal aspect of doing marketing, we need to have the same in the digital side and we are on this journey to get the whole organization trained, that digital is just another way of communicating and engaging with our consumers. And this is also where Beamly comes into play. It is there to train and to engage the whole organization on that journey.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Bart, just a follow-up on that. What is the percentage of spending today in digital and where should we look for that to go over the next couple of years?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We don't disclose that, and I'm not going to disclose that ever. It's rapidly increasing. That's all I'm going to say.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Can you give us a sense for A&P's spending levels in the quarter? What were they year-over-year and plans going forward. You've been generating some efficiencies there, so do you think A&P can move down as percent of sales over time or do you think you might need to re-boost spending to drive improving top line trends going forward? Both for the heritage Coty portfolio, but also any initial thoughts around the pending P&G brands? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I will start and then, if Patrice has any further comments. So I think in terms of ANCP spending, as you know, we make a distinction between what we really think is strategic spend and non-strategic spend. The difference being that strategic spend is actually what the consumer sees. Non-strategic spend is kind of like, the money we waste in the office. So clearly, producing a commercial is non-strategic spend because the consumer doesn't see it. So clearly the actual airing of a commercial would be strategic spend. Strategic spend, other things would be is like the furniture that we use in Color Cosmetics and are in stores or the Beauty Assistants that we use on the Fragrance business. So those are all basically strategic components. I can tell you that the strategic spend is substantially increasing in particular because we've seen \u2013 we've cut the non-strategic spend and on top of that, even within the strategic spend, we've gotten greater efficiencies in the media buying area.","So overall, the output is substantially increasing. Clearly, I would have liked to see a bigger response to that in terms of top line growth. Having said that, we are seeing these in some brands but it is being offset, like I said before because of a rationalization of detail and of certain business lines, plus the fact that on certain brands we have not gotten yet due to (36:55) response that we want to have. Anything, you want to add?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","No, just on the more long-term perspective, I think the level of investment that in the overall ANCP line is roughly in line with what we want to do on the long-term once again. And because of all the efficiency, because of all the indirect procurement savings and because of the shift of money from non-strategic to strategic as well as the reallocation within the strategic spend to power brands. Already this is going to hit significantly in terms of GFP's (37:29) the brands that we would like to push in order to regain the momentum on the top line. So the level that we currently have is roughly the right level plus or minus and it's more an effort to make sure that we have the right ROI and that we are a bit more diligent in the way we shift the money from non-strategic to strategic.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the broader cost savings program in general, the $270 million program. Can you give us an update on how much savings have been realized so far? Any thoughts on how the program is progressing, and if there could be additional upside over time?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So, it's a good question. So actually, as I said, the savings that we have on the life to-date of the program, so the cumulative savings is $170 million. The target that we have to be achieved at the end of fiscal 2017 is $270 million, and we are very confident that we are going to achieve that. Some pieces of the program have been already executed, like the China mass organization, but other parties are still ongoing. But I am very confident that we are going to achieve this $270 million target, and once again, as of December 30, 2015 we are at $170 million.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my questions. Actually, both about categories specifically in the U.S., so one, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Nail category, so while Sally Hansen is doing well, didn't really mention OPI. I was just wondering, can you talk about what efforts are out there to kind of re-grow the nail category? And then the second question with the, I guess the good performance of Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs, can you talk a little bit more between specialty channels and maybe the department stores, where I think they were a little bit more promotional over the holidays, and how that balanced out for the quarter? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, in terms of the Nail category, clearly there are two very distinctive segments. One is what happens at retail and the other one is what happens in salons. So, in terms of retail, which should be the predominant domain \u2013 or is the domain of Sally Hansen, so the Nail category at the moment is largely flat. Sally Hansen, as you well know, has done extremely well behind the launch of Miracle Gel, has gained substantial share. We are going to anniversary that substantial share gain in the second half of this year. So we are going to see a little bit more of a flattening out of the growth profile, clearly in terms of Color Cosmetics for Coty as a result, because we are going to index year-on-year. But the Nail category is largely flat in the U.S. for the time being, while we are gaining share. Clearly, we are working on initiatives to further enhance category growth and market share for Sally Hansen.","OPI is a very different business. OPI really should not be in a very massive way into retail, because mostly salon brands. And like I already detailed to you, we are rationalizing some of the OPI business outside of salon, simply because we believe that this is a salon brand and it's a brand that salon owners should be proud of to use, and we don't want to see a proliferation across many channels, of these brands. Here the effort is very much in terms of driving both category and share within salons, and there are different segments which are relevant than that, and we are working on innovations, which \u2013 it's too early for me to discuss.","Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein, so in terms of specialty retailers, yes, there is a promotional arena out there in terms of the high-end retailers around Christmas, as we well know. In particular, because online, I don't have to tell you, is an increasing percentage of the total market and so that's not changing. As you've seen from our results, we have stayed largely above the fray in this area, and hopefully \u2013 by investing, really investing in consumer pool promotion and consumer pool rather than discounting, we are going to continue to stay above the fray.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Good morning everyone. I have two questions. One is if you can comment on, probably Coty first and then broadly on the industry? How you see Coty performance by channel, because this is the way that I understand you're going to be reporting and reorganizing going forward. So basically, professional, luxury and consumer. If you can tell us which channels you're doing better and what would be the growth rate vis-\u00e0-vis the minus one like-for-like, and what is, you believe, the channel growth in general. And my second question has to do with, it was very helpful that what you mentioned \u2013 about Hypermarcas and what is the rationale about \u2013 the Hypermarcas acquisition. Could you tell us based on that and also heading towards the integration with Procter, whether there are some geographies that you feel that you need to invest more ahead of the deal to get that kind of go-to-market capability in place ahead of the deal? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so our performance measurement going forward is not going to be so much per channel. It is really going to be by category. So the luxury division is going to be responsible for fragrance and skin care and so we'll be reporting fragrance and skin care business. Our Consumer Beauty business is going to be a responsible for Color Cosmetics, hair coloring and styling as well as body care in the mass retail channel and we're going to report it as such. And finally, we are going to have a professional business which is going to report. So, it is a combination of category and channel.","So, in terms of the category performance, I really detailed a little bit what the market growth rates are. So, if you look at the overall growth rate of the current business and I have to exclude hair coloring and retailing, styling because I don't have the data at this stage. We have some data but I'm not comfortable enough to discuss those with you today. If you look at the overall market growth rate in Beauty in North America and Europe, at the moment it's probably, slightly north of 1%. You're going to see a Fragrance business which is flat to marginally up with basically prestige growing faster than mass. And then, you see skin care business which is now growing at a much more modest rate in the low single-digits and the Color Cosmetics business category which is still doing reasonably well growing several percentage points with basically Nail more flattish and with the other parts still showing very healthy growth and that gives you a rough basically perspective on a category basis.","On basically Hypermarcas and other geographies, so I don't have to tell you that still today and including the P&G transaction, we're still predominantly in North America and our Western European business or European business, which is still the bulk of our business. So we need to over time, increase our exposure to developing markets. I know this is maybe most recently not the hottest story in developing markets but over time, longer term developing markets in our mind remain markets with higher growth rates and this is also why clearly we did the Hypermarcas transaction because we believe that this is going to be growth accretive over time. And while it comes as no surprise considering our minimal presence we still have in Asia and in Africa and Middle East we also need to expand in those geographies. So I hope that answers your question.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","One follow-up if I could. You comment on travel retail, you're on trend, (46:26) what you are seeing in the overall travel retail channel that would be helpful?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yes, travel retail is, in terms of the overall market is a much, much more difficult business than it was \u2013 even a year ago, and a lot of that has to do with traffic as you can imagine. So it is under more pressure as a market, and clearly we're doing a good job in travel retail but the overall market conditions are not as favorable as they were. So, as you know, this comes and goes with the overall sentiment, so time will tell.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So I think that was our last question. Can I thank all you for being on the call. And we're looking forward to having more intense discussion with you in about three months from now when we also have the S-4 in the P&G business. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"6237":["Coty, Inc.

This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement and recent developments and Camillo will offer his initial thoughts on the state of the business, and then we would be pleased to take your questions.","The last several months have been truly transformational for Coty. On October 1, we completed the merger of the P&G Specialty Beauty business into Coty with a $1 billion lower cash payment than anticipated at the announcement of the transaction. I would like to thank the teams involved from Coty and P&G for all of their hard work over the last 15 months in creating the platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry.","I'm confident that we now have largely the right team, organizational structure and culture to make the vision of this merger a reality. Our new CEO, Camillo Pane, the executive team and the divisional, regional and country management teams are now in place and are working on exiting transitional service arrangements with P&G while increasingly focusing on rebuilding business momentum. As expected, the extensive work over the last 15 months on closing the transaction and merging the two businesses has come at a cost.","As discussed prior to the closure, the resources which normally work on the business have also been working on closing the transaction and the setup and future of the combined company. The resulting distraction, as well as the recent change in management team in our headquarters, regions and countries have contributed to a decline in Coty's standalone revenues and profits in Q1.","Reported and constant currency revenues declined moderately and adjusted operating income declined by a mid-teens percentage compared to the same period last year. While we are anticipating similar revenue trends in Q2, we are committed not only to real improvement in the trends in the second half excluding divestitures, but also to achieving further improvement for the combined company in the following fiscal years.","This combined company 2017 outlook replaces all prior fiscal 2017 outlooks. Importantly, we continue to target the total four-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million respectively, with no change to the operating costs to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020, despite the profit impact of the current decline in revenues.","Additionally, we remain firmly committed to using Coty's expected strong post-merger cash flow to build Coty into a much stronger global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. In this respect, we are very happy with our recent acquisition of the Hypermarcas beauty business in Brazil, and our pending acquisition of ghd, which we expect will continue to strength Coty's global portfolio, its growth exposure and its profit and cash generation.","As the parting Interim CEO and remaining Chairman, I believe the future of the new Coty under our new CEO, Camillo Pane, is a bright one. It certainly will be a journey to realize the ambitions we have set for the company and while there may be challenges as we integrate and rebuild the business, we are firmly committed to realizing the ambitions we have and delivering value for all our shareholders.","I will now turn it over to Patrice to discuss the Q1 results in more detail.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Bart, and good morning, everyone. Q1 net revenues declined 3% as reported and declined 2% at constant currency. Excluding the 6% contribution from the Brazil Acquisition, net revenues declined 8%. Our adjusted gross margin declined 150 basis points to 58.8%, driven by the contribution of the lower-gross-margin Brazil Acquisition, as the gross margin of the remaining Coty business remained consistent year-over-year. The Q1 adjusted operating income declined 14% to $106.4 million, resulting in a 15.4% adjusted operating margin. This decline was driven by two primary factors. First, revenue declined from steady to lower adjusted gross profit and operating profit. Second, Q1 fixed costs increased on an absolute and percentage basis as we ramped up starting another investment in anticipation of the close of the P&G Beauty transaction.","By segment, two of the segments, Skin & Body Care and Fragrance , showed solid profitability performance despite the broader top-line weakness. The Q1 Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin improved 280 basis points to 9%, fueled by a mix-driven improvement in gross margin. The Fragrance adjusted operating margin reached a solid 21.5%, marginally declining versus prior year. The Color Cosmetics adjusted operating margin declined 460 basis point to 11.3%, as we ramped up A&P investments despite the lower revenues. Finally, the Brazil Acquisition reached an adjusted operating margin of 8.6% largely reflecting the fact that Q1 is typically the lowest quarter seasonally for the Brazil business.","Moving down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to negative 38.4% in the prior year, reflecting the $113.3 million tax benefit in the prior-year period.","Altogether, these drove an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.23. During the quarter and prior to the close of the merger, we repurchased 1.4 million share as well as we returned additional cash to shareholders with the distribution of an annual dividend of $0.2750 per share.","Turning to the capital structure, we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in net debt. In October, we took the opportunity to successfully borrow an incremental $1.1 billion in term loans and use the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility.","In addition, we refinanced approximately $1.6 billion in term loans to reduce annual interest expense by almost $10 million per year. We also benefited from only $1.9 billion in assumed debt in the merger, which was $1 billion less than the assumed debt amount where we first announced the merger in July, 2015.","As far as the merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty business is concerned, we are confident about the potential of this merger to strengthen Coty's margin, earnings, and cash generation profile.","I'm happy to confirm the four-year synergies and working capital benefits of $750 million and $500 million, respectively, with no change to the operating cost to realize both. We also remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EPS target of at least $1.53 for fiscal 2020.","We remain confident in the long-term cash flow profile of the company as well as the strength of our balance sheet, which will allow us to fulfill our long-term ambition.","I will now turn it over to Camillo to offer his preliminary views on the business.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Patrice. And good morning to everyone. It's my great privilege to take over the reins of leadership at such a transformational moment. With this merger, we've brought together a powerful portfolio of beauty brands and some of the world's most talented people in beauty and consumer goods.","Being in the CEO role for a little over a month now, I've been focused on three key priorities. First, I'm visiting many of the Coty key countries, meeting with the significant customers, and reviewing the business with the country management teams. Second, I'm now reviewing in depth the innovation pipeline for the next one, two years. Third, I continue to support the internal work in accelerating focus capabilities in digital communication, e-commerce and in-store. While I will offer a more comprehensive assessment of our business on the next earnings call in February, I did want to take this opportunity to offer some initial thoughts.","The substantial changes within Coty over the last year from carving out the Beauty business from P&G to introducing a new organizational structure and changing the management teams in a number of countries have clearly impacted the organization. In the short term, this means some lumpiness quarter to quarter as everyone settles into the roles and the organization learns to run as one company.","However, I have a high level of confidence in the long-term outlook and fundamentals of the business.","Within the combined Coty portfolio, I see a lot of positives in Professional Beauty and Luxury. The salon hair business continues to perform well, and while still early, we are seeing early indication that the OPI nail brand is a very good fit for this division. And I believe this should result in much better mid- to long-term gross momentum for OPI.","Speaking of the Luxury division, this business is anchored by a number of leading brands including Gucci, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, and philosophy. And I'm encouraged by the pipeline of upcoming launches in the combined portfolio, including of course the launch of Tiffany.","Turning to Consumer Beauty, it's clear that this is a division that is facing a number of challenges. These challenges include the positioning of some of the brands, the strength of the pipeline, the in-store execution, as well as the competitive pressure in the market. We have begun our work to address these issues. And I will have more information to provide in the next call, as to the steps we are taking to regain momentum in this business.","I'm very excited, and encouraged by the progress we're making to communicate and engage with today's consumers, who are increasingly living in a digital world. Our digital capabilities were significantly enhanced by the last year acquisition of the digital marketing platform, Beamly. Beamly is already helping us improve the social engagement of our brands through campaign optimization, social listening and deeper brand targeting. We have significantly increased the proportion of our media spending aimed at digital, and I'm pleased with the results I've seen.","While a key focus in the near term will be on integrating the P&G Specialty Beauty business and improving our growth momentum; we believe there is space for selective M&A where it can be managed without unduly disrupting our integration growth focus, where it clearly benefits our future growth trajectory and deliver shareholder value.","With respect to our recent transactions, we continue to be encouraged by the end market performance of the Brazil acquisition, with self-through growing strong double-digit in a market which is growing high single-digit. We also announced on October 17, the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire ghd, a premium brand in high-end hairstyling appliances. We believe ghd's strong historical growth, driven by geographical expansion and channel diversification beyond salons, including a sizeable e-commerce business, would only be enhanced by Wella's substantial distribution capabilities and complementary portfolio brands.","The acquisition, which is expected to close prior to the end of this calendar year, is a first step in our strategy to gradually shift the market growth exposure of our combined portfolio closer to the 3%, 4% global beauty industry growth rate.","I'm very energized by the opportunities ahead for the new Coty and look forward to working with my new leadership team to drive Coty to profitable growth and to be a new global leader and challenge in the beauty industry. Thank you.","We'll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi. Your line is now open.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Two questions, sort of in the near term as the second quarter is going to be a continuation of the underlying sales growth we just saw now, I'm not sure kind of what light switch flicked as we go into the back half and revenue growth accelerates all that much, so is it just the timing of the new product launches or do expect some underlying improvement in the market? If you could help us have confidence that this really negative trend isn't going to push us through the entire year.","And then question, I know you said in your prepared comments that $1.53 for 2020 is still the target but it sounds like today is a downward revision to the growth outlook for fiscal 2017. So what's better in your forecast that helps you make up for that shortfall, so you could still have that $1.53? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, maybe we can start with the growth outlook. So clearly what is impacting in Q2 are the same factors which are impacting in Q1. We should not forget that, so clearly, fiscal 2017 is clearly a year of transition and the transition is largely taking place in the first six months and only gradually comes out in the back half. What do I mean by transition? Clearly, we have a complete new organizational structure, which is different from either the Coty or the P&G structure, and we have many new people. And so the combination of the two means that a lot of people have new jobs in different locations at some point in time.","So that has clearly created a substantial level of distraction. People are not necessarily fully focused on the business for a period of time because they're in transition, or alternatively they're also helping out in the integration of the business. And so those two factors basically have caused distraction and have caused us to lose momentum basically in the business, which we believe we're in the process of addressing.","In addition to that, we believe that those factors will abate in the second half. In addition to that, we believe we have a good pipeline or a better pipeline on some of our brands in the second half, which makes us believe that the trend will improve in the second half as well. So those are the two key factors. Some factors abating, and at the same time, pipeline improving, which should improve the momentum in the second six months.","In terms of the earnings per share, we believe basically that beyond the cost synergies of the business, there is also an improvement that we can have on the underlying business, and therefore, we believe the $1.53 by fiscal 2020 is a doable and reachable number.","Operator","Thank you.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And \u2013 sorry. Go ahead.","Operator","And our next....","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","No, no, no. Go ahead.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And so, my question is just in terms of the disruption to the core business taking longer than you expect. Again, I sort of say, okay, that $1.53 number, was it that that $1.53 target was just initially extremely conservative and now you think that you can do it because the recovery is going to be faster, because it just seems like the numbers are going to be coming down in the short term, so you're building in an even bigger hockey stick in the out years. And given the recent trends, it seems like that's a heck of a leap of faith.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","I think that to be able to answer this question, we need to step back and look at the way we have built this $1.53. So, the $1.53 was the add-up of the Coty business, the P&G business, and the whole level of synergies pulling bottom line. That's the way we have built the $1.53, which has just the sum of these three pillars. So, this $750 million synergies, we confirm that this is the target to achieve in year four, and we remain very firmly committed to that. So, there is no reason why in year four we cannot achieve that. And, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasize what we said during the Road Show is that this is without any underlying improvement of the business and this is without Hypermarcas, okay. So, it's clear that this $750 million are and remain, and, in year four, we still remain committed by this $1.53.","Operator","Thank you. And, our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. First, just to follow up on that discussion. Patrice, also, you \u2013 no one's mentioned margins. So, I just wanted to confirm that the $1.53, that your vision of kind of 19.5-ish percent margin in 2020 also still holds or if there is \u2013 you said there will be greater reinvestment needed over the time period.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No. So, the assumption that we had when we built this arithmetic are still there, and so these $1.53 are still compatible with the margin, which is in the high teens, which is 19.6% is the number that we are quoting in the Road Show.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then on brands, I did want to talk a little bit about the Color Cosmetic business. There has been a lot of surprising amount of news flow around the COVERGIRL and the Max Factor brands in the last three months or so, I mean, Max Factor re-launching in the U.S. after leaving I think 10 years ago. And then COVERGIRL, making some pretty bold moves in terms of their brand imagery representation and so on.","So, Camillo, if you could talk a little bit about \u2013 I guess, it doesn't feel like the management team is running those two brands, have been asleep at the switch, I mean, they've been more active arguably than they've been in a while. So to what degree was your team involved in that process? Or was this sort of \u2013 they were throwing some stuff at the wall before the merger was complete? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, Camillo is not going to answer any questions as we said earlier. He will do this in February, but I'll answer the question. So we have not been involved basically with the marketing efforts of P&G prior to the transaction because we were competitors, I might remind you. And therefore, we had no influence on any of their programs. And this business we've now owned for six weeks. So we are basically digging into the details of this business to try to understand that. And when we come back in February, hopefully, we'll have a better picture on this business and we can answer all of your questions a little bit better than we can now.","What I can tell you is that Max Factor was not being re-launched in a major way in the United States. There is a lot of activity on COVERGIRL, but as Camillo already has alluded to, there is a lot of work that needs to be done on the Color Cosmetics brand, in particular on those two brands that you just mentioned.","And we're in the process of understanding, analyzing and formulating new plans to tackle the issues on those two brands, but it is premature for us to make any concrete statements on that.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And would you just \u2013 the fact, the idea that all the transition the organization is going through, the people moving around, I mean, I understand all of that, but the level of impact on the brand \u2013 when brands are healthy, they sort of can coast along for a bit with a little bit less love and attention and it would seem that these brands really took it on the chin when sort of their focus changed. So, would you say that the performance in the last few weeks has sort of made you feel a bit differently, not about the long-term potential about the brands but the actual level of the health of the brands today?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","No. I remain very positive about the brands, to be honest with you, because I think it is a portfolio of a set of very strong brands. What I \u2013 particularly on the P&G business, we should not forget that 18 months prior to the announcement of the transaction it was known internally that this business would be divested. And between announcement and closure, there were 15 months, so arguably this business has been in limbo for two to three years. And clearly this is not very beneficial to any business as you can imagine because the focus comes off.","So, there is a certain level of neglect that has happened; in particular because not the entire organization has come with the P&G business, so it's not like we are transferring a existing company with an existing management team into Coty because only part of that team is coming to us. So, there have been a material level of neglect on these businesses, which we are trying to understand and we're reformulating plans to reactivate all of these brands.","Having said that, I don't have to tell you the brands like COVERGIRL, Wella, Max Factor, they're fantastic brands. It's a great portfolio of brands, and there is an inherent strength basically in these brands, and we just need to extract that. And so, we're in the process of doing that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Bart.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","Hi.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Can you just give us some more granularity on this back-half acceleration category-by-category? I know it's been asked a couple of times, because like I also wonder like what are the retailers saying, because like you look at a brand like COVERGIRL, which is pretty close to market leadership in U.S. mascara cosmetics, and to have a business like that down 8% to 9%, obviously category's down, so the buyer's job is at risk and you have all these sort of moving pieces. So, I'm just curious if you can, and I know it's kind of a long-winded question, but can we just go like category-by-category and sort of map out like why you'd think we're going to get to that acceleration starting in that March quarter?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, let's just go back to the comments that Camillo made on the various businesses for the combined entity, and I'm talking about the combined entity here. So, we believe that Professional is in good shape and will show good momentum in the second half. The Professional business has done pretty well over the more recent periods and will continue, in our minds, to show solid momentum. And on top of it, it's going to have OPI folded into that. So, which we also believe is going to be very positive on OPI, because as you might remember, Coty did not have a Professional division, and it had an OPI Professional brand, and it was very difficult for Coty to manage that business, because it had a skeleton infrastructure in order to do so. Now we have a full-fledged infrastructure and we believe that we'll be very healthy on the OPI business. So we believe Professional on the P&G and on the Coty side will show very nice trends.","On the Fragrance side, we believe that on our main brands Gucci, HUGO BOSS, Calvin Klein, et cetera, we have some very nice initiatives in order to steadily improve the momentum on that business relative to where we are today. I also would like to offer to you that in the first quarter for sure and potentially in the second quarter, there has been some rationalization of wholesale inventory taking place which clearly also is going to gradually abate.","So the number one challenge remains basically on the Consumer Beauty business and this will take longer. We might see some improvement, but there is a lot of things which need to be tackled and we already mentioned we have several large brands, and Camillo already alluded to this. Clearly, we have challenges on COVERGIRL, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, all of which need to be addressed and we're in the process of doing that. So, net-net I think Professional should see good momentum and continued good momentum; I think on Luxury we should see improving momentum; Consumer Beauty will be the biggest challenge and I think that will take longer; we might see some improved results in the second half, but it will take longer to address that.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then the internal distraction stuff, I mean, are you largely done with the meetings and who my boss is and where the boss is going to sit and what might \u2013 it seems like that was what you attributed a lot of the softness in the quarter, maybe through the December quarter through like \u2013 are all those kind of initiatives done and people are kind of like go out, go do your job now and forget these like weeklong meetings about whom I'm reporting to and what my responsibilities are?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, clearly we have some wholesale movements of people into new jobs over the last couple of months, really starting at the end of the last fiscal year, all the way through the most recent weeks. So that's pretty much done now. So people are in place, the teams are in place and we are now focusing on and extracting ourselves from transitional service arrangements, and rebuilding the growth momentum. So the teams are in place, they are sitting in most cases in the final locations, not everywhere, but in most cases already in the final locations. So we are pretty much getting there.","So from a team composition point of view, structure point of view, that's pretty much there; in the vast majority of cases, they're already sitting in the final locations. So we now actually have and are starting to work on the business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Stephanie Wissink of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I just have another follow-up on the human capital versus like financial capital transitory risk. If you could just talk a little bit about what you think the investment in A&P might need to be over the next 6 to 12 months to really see some acceleration in the business, once you get past some of this human capital disruption?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","In A&P, is that what you said?","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yes, please, the A&P.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, I really don't think there is a need to increase the level of A&P in this business. In the combined entity, we sit above industry average investment levels. So the key question is not basically if there is the right money, the key question is do we have all the right initiatives and strategy in place in the various brands in order to accelerate the growth of the business, and that's what we're working on. But there is no need for incremental A&P investment in the business.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And, Bart, maybe could you just talk about then where some of the pivots might be where you've invested historically and where you're looking to invest more, I know you talked about digital in your prepared remarks, but maybe give us some sense of where we could see some of the movement within the dollar.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","Well, it's very clear; the world is changing, the world is moving like to a digital world, and you will see an acceleration over time of a movement of traditional forms of media into digital. You will also see from a sales point of view, moving more online which does not \u2013 which is e-commerce, but that might be with existing customers or with new customers, so there is a shift from a go-to-market point of view and a shift from an investment point of view into much more of a digital space. And there is also an intensification of the focus now on creating a much stronger pipeline going forward in order to build momentum on the business. So those are key areas of focus for the company.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Bart, maybe could you give an order of priority of how much of the second half improvement is related to innovation versus abating factors, because if you're not spending more money, but you are expecting the sort of hockey stick change from first half to the second half, maybe you could help sort of just prioritize those various buckets that you've talked about, in terms of what they are going to provide, because I'm still struggling with what you mean by, quote unquote, real improvement.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, yeah. We are not going to put an exact number on real improvement for a very simple fact is that we've owned the P&G business for six weeks, and so it is very difficult for us to give you an exact outlook on that part of the business. So, on the Coty side of the business, we do have basically some very nice initiatives, and we are much more comfortable to make statements about real improvement in terms of the business trends. For instance, we have CKO, we have a clear basically breakthrough mascara on Rimmel. We have in our minds the much better trends in OPI now that's being managed by the new Coty Professional business. So we have a number of factors which we believe will materially improve the trend.","We also don't have distraction. The distraction in the first half clearly has led not just to reduction in wholesale but also in retail trade inventories in a number of places, so which will also go away. So it is a combination of certain factors not being there, on the other side having a much stronger innovation pipeline behind the business.","Our feeling about the Coty business is clearly much stronger than about the P&G business simply because the P&G business is a new business. Having said that, to make, basically, statements about just the Coty business clearly going forward is not highly relevant since we own the total business, and so this is also why we've replaced the outlook statement.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then you talked about Q2 revenue trends, but what about your thoughts on the operating results? How fast can you get your team to get to work on that? And then I guess I understand the distraction associated with getting the deal over the finish line, but why wouldn't there be a more equitable decline across categories and regions, assuming that there is not one group that's more distractive than the other, like, why isn't there more an equitable distribution in terms of the distraction quotient?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","What do you mean, equitable? Does it mean like certain categories have more right to decline than others or what? I'm not sure I understand.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, the opposite, like you would have extracted sort of an equitable amount of distraction across the categories but obviously you're seeing different declines across segments and across geographies.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","Yeah, but you are seeing basically the declines are pretty much across the board, across the three main buckets in terms of Fragrances, Color Cosmetics and Body Care. There is really not one excluded. So, clearly \u2013 I think that's what you would expect when there is massive distraction happening. So, again, fiscal 2017, I just want to reiterate, fiscal 2017 is going to be a year of transition. Having said that, at the same time, we believe that the longer term outlook remains the same. But I think in terms of categories going down, all the categories have gone down.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, to answer the first part of your question, Olivia, as you know strictly we have not given any annual EPS guidance. But what we have said in the press release is that we remain committed to our previously communicated adjusted EBITDA target of $1.53 for fiscal 2020. So, there is no change to this and the expected accretion of the deal. We have also continued to discuss that there will be some dis-synergies of at least $50 million in year one as we step up to support the combined organization before we step down and recognize the other savings.","In addition to that, the way you should think about the fiscal 2017 EPS drivers, relative to fiscal 2016, is that there is going to be some incremental depreciation as we begin to spend the $500 million of CapEx as well as higher interest line resulting from the incremental debt that we have. So, I think we should re-think it this way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning. So, just wanted to continue on that last line of thinking. So, if you take the consolidated results that you provided in the second 8-K this morning, before talking about the incremental depreciation and higher interest expense, the base is, call it, $0.95, take into account the $50 million of dis-synergies, to $0.90, is that roughly what we should be thinking about as the earnings base before the decline in 2017?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No, we're not going to go into any guidance on that, but I think you should really come back to the previous statement I made, which are that you should factor in to the way you should look at it the additional depreciation. The interest line, the tax line and the $50 million dis-synergies based on what we have seen in fiscal 2016.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","I think that will give you the answer to your question.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. And then switching back to the sales growth numbers. So, could you talk about how both the legacy business and the Procter brands are doing on an expectation basis in terms of that real improvement, and I guess in particular if you look at the results that you disclosed in that same 8-K, the Procter brands looked like they were down marginally compared to the Coty business. So is it fair to think that the Procter business is performing better on whole than the Coty business?","And then just going back to the previous commentary, how then should we think about where the greatest relative improvement is going to come from on a go-forward basis, meaning through the year to that real improvement?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","Yeah, I'm not sure the P&G improvement on an underlying basis in terms of consumption is better or worse than the Coty business over the last 12 months. And if you look at it over a long period of time, the trends are very, very similar. So I would say \u2013 and we're still looking at the P&G businesses in detail, in particular also at the trade inventories which are \u2013 or have been created on this business over the last couple of months.","In terms of going forward, I'll come back to what I said before, on Professional, we see basically continued good momentum, and we believe that the incorporation of OPI will benefit OPI. So, we feel positive about Professional.","On the Luxury business, we believe that based on what is coming to the market under the key brands, which are anywhere from Gucci, Calvin Klein, HUGO BOSS, and a few smaller ones, we believe there should be improved momentum on the Luxury business with the main challenge remaining on the Consumer Beauty business and there there's several brands which are key, which is clearly COVERGIRL, Max Factor and Sally Hansen. Those are the three brands where we are working very, very hard in terms of improving the momentum and here we believe this will take a bit longer than the statements we've made just about Luxury and we're working on that, but we will have a much better understanding of these brands already when we come back in the call in February.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Real quick, just to clarify on the guidance. So, first off on the $1.53 in 2020, I think you were pretty clear, Patrice, that getting to that number didn't require any improvement in the underlying business. Now, it seems like given the first quarter results that you do expect needing improvement in the underlying business in order to hit that $1.53? Just want to clarify that.","And then also on the second half guidance, in the press release announcing the deal, it reiterated that you're looking for growth in the second half, and now, you're only looking for improvement in the recent trends. I just want to clarify that you aren't expecting any growth in either legacy Coty or P&G Beauty in the second half? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, on the first one, what we said at that time is that the merger benefit, the mechanical impact of the merger benefit would deliver $1.53, and that it does not reflect improvement on the underlying business or the Hypermarcas transaction. What we're saying now is that we're going to achieve at least $1.53 and that is on the combination of the merger benefits and underlying business improvement, but the emphasis that we're going to achieve at least $1.53, and that's the statement that we're making.","In terms of the statement for the second half, we have to make a statement on the combined entity business for the second half, because we own all the brands and not half the brands. And so it would be irrelevant just to make a statement about just the Coty business, no matter how positive we might feel about this or not. So the statement is the statement, we've owned the business now for six weeks, and we've only been able to dig into the business in all its details for six weeks, so we cannot make a statement beyond that. It's just not possible because none of you on the call would do that, because you don't have enough understanding of the business. So it's not possible to make a different statement than that.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Did your outlook for the legacy Coty business change for the second half then, obviously...","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","No, we're not going to have this discussion, because it's a irrelevant discussion. We're making the statement that is in the press release.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one question on the Fragrance, obviously very weak, can you maybe go into some of the drivers, obviously you mentioned the inventory decline in the wholesale channel, but it sounds like maybe that was impacted by the distraction, I think you mentioned that. So a little bit confused on who is driving that inventory decline in wholesale, maybe were you guys proactively accelerating your pullback in the non-core brands, maybe just a little bit more detail there. Thanks.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. So, I would say on the Fragrance brand, we have a continuous effort, basically is to gradually clean up some of the wholesale or gray market inventories, in order to strengthen the equity of the brands, which clearly when people are distracted and changing jobs, if anything that accelerates on its own, for a very simple reason, when people aren't there for a while or changing jobs or even between things, some of that business goes away automatically. So, yes, there has been an acceleration of the decline in the wholesale inventories.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. The first one was just on M&A. Patrice, can you give us detail on when you expect to earn your cost of capital in the P&G deal or what level of returns you're expecting on the deal through fiscal 2020?","And then, Bart, you emphasized in the release that you'd continue to participate in industry consolidation going forward. I guess, as you look back on M&A historically over the last few years, in terms of TJoy and philosophy, the Avon bid, perhaps even P&G so far, a bear could quibble that acquisitions haven't worked out that successfully in terms of driving shareholder value. So, any kind of thoughts on your ability to add value going forward? And what the past, kind of how that informs that ability? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, clearly, we have just confirmed basically the benefits of the merger with P&G, and based on that, clearly we would expect a return which is very attractive and well ahead of the cost of capital, because otherwise we wouldn't have done the transaction in the first place. So we just confirmed to you basically all the underlying financial assumptions, which make this transaction very attractive.","So with \u2013 that's on the P&G deal, on the Hypermarcas deal, you have seen, and we have seen very positive results both in market and financially and we're very confident about that, the same for the Bourjois deal, the same for OPI, the same for Manhattan and so the same for philosophy, they're all basically good transactions. The one which we could argue with is the TJoy transaction in China, which was a complete debacle. So I would agree with you, but that's like one out of half a dozen transactions.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And what year are you expecting to earn your cost of capital in terms of returns from the P&G deal?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","No, we're not going to, because then I have to practically outline to you all the underlying basically profit and cash flows assumptions and we're not going to do that here.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Just two questions. One, I guess, maybe just continuing on the M&A, but the other side. I think you've talked about potential asset sales. So just with some of the recent performances, I'm wondering if there are any other brands that may not fit the combined company. Just wondering if you could provide any color in terms of kind of the portfolio rationalization.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So we have previously announced that we would divest 6% to 8% of the combined entity portfolio. We have pretty much finalized the list which sits behind that. We are working basically on the process, which is associated with that. We remain convinced that we will make this announcement regarding the divestiture well ahead prior to the end of the year. And so, the process is pretty much on track, and will unfold itself in due time.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, there is a no change from previously.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then the second question just going back to the innovation, and just with I guess, 15 months of kind of knowing this combination was coming, can you maybe talk about maybe some of the cross-collaboration opportunities that are out there between Coty side, P&G side, where you see learning from best practices, just maybe on a more upbeat note, just like thinking about the opportunity for really enhanced innovation that comes through over the next couple of years.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","So, there is a number of very clear benefits other than the pure cost and cash benefits that Patrice already has outlined. So, just to give you some very clear examples of that. So, first of all, there is the geographical benefit, in a number of countries, both parties were relatively marginal players and combined they are basically critical mass players; countries like Mexico, et cetera, are classic examples of this. So, we will have a real infrastructure to build from.","That clearly is only going to really materialize post the actions of transitional service arrangement, implementing all the restructuring programs et cetera. But there is a real benefit that we can build off that. We will have the benefit of moving as part of that from distributors into full-fledged operational entities, which there is a clear benefit for, for sure on the top-line, but also on the bottom line from doing that, moving out of these distributors.","There is the benefit of OPI brands being managed by the Professional division, which there is a clear benefit of that, because Coty did have \u2013 only had a skeleton infrastructure to manage that. And I believe that it's a very good news for OPI on a global basis for it to be managed by the Professional division.","There are benefits in terms of cross-fertilization on the R&D side. P&G has certain skill sets in terms of fragrances, which Coty doesn't have and Coty has certain skill sets in the R&D particularly in the packaging area which P&G doesn't have. So there is a clear basically synergistic benefit between the two. That clearly there is the best practice benchmarking in terms of cost of goods, manufacturing and operating cost, which is starting to happen as we speak. So there are clear basically benefits in this area as well.","So, in addition to that, there are clearly all the financial benefits from a procurement point of view, which we already alluded to. So there are synergistic benefits in particular I would say in R&D and manufacturing and basically go-to-market and in terms of scale in emerging markets.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. I appreciate the update. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser, B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thanks. I was wondering if you could give some color on whether your product line rationalizations have started already in earnest and is there any way to quantify the impact of that on the negative 8% like-for-like sales growth in the quarter?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","No, product rationalization, you're talking about divestitures?","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yeah, I thought even apart from divestitures you were looking at pruning SKUs and certain product lines, maybe even exit, apart from the divestitures?","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","No, that is not a main focus of the business for the time being. So divestitures, yes, we are pruning the portfolios from a number of brands point of view, which is leading to the 6% to 8% divestiture program, but that is not basically other than the normal churn which we have in this business anyway, because there's a substantial number of SKUs which get replaced every single year, the pruning happens every year. You create new SKUs and you prune old ones; that is part of the beauty industry.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I think when you had originally talked about the synergies and were giving more information, in the first year there is really not net synergies being realized because there's some investment. Can you give us an idea as to what the cadence of that investment will be like as we progress through the fiscal year? Is it going to hit kind of right away or is it going to take a while to figure out where those investment things need to occur?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, on the synergies in year one, so what we said is that we had $300 million of synergies, which was the combination of the $350 million gross synergies minus $50 million dis-synergies. This $350 million of gross synergies were due to carve-out not being transferred. What we can see is that clearly, this amount that has been transferred to us is lower because of P&G has actually anticipated some of the \u2013 have made cost savings already on their structure.","So, these \u2013 and as we are now, as we speak, we're firming up the phasing of the synergies as we balance our focus on driving long-term margin improvement, while we need to improve the growth trend of the business. Well, these being said, we are not far from the $300 million and we clearly confirm that we are targeting our realizing the $750 million in the next four years.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Sorry, I just wanted to follow-up on the restated financials, if there is any timeline for when you're going to be giving those to us, with the new segments?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, actually, what we've done so far, Lauren, is that you have a Form 8-K where we have shared the top-line momentum in fiscal 2016, as well as the profitability on the combined entity and the profitability of P&G and Coty, so we can see that the adjusted operating margin of Coty is 14.3%, and the one of the P&G Specialty business is 7.6%. So that information that we have already given, I think that was already a help for you guys. On the combined entity, I think that's going to be another couple of months before we can share that.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. So, it will be a couple of months before we get the new kind of segment breakdown?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No, the new segment breakdown...","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","As far as...","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No. The new segment breakdown will be at the occasion of our next earnings call.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect. That's what I needed. Thank you so much.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","You're welcome.","Bart Becht - Coty, Inc.","Very good. Can I just thank all of you for being on the call and so it's been a good basically discussion. The future for Coty remains very, very bright in my mind, and I'm very happy that we have a new team on place, welcoming Camillo, basically as the new CEO. And I'll be a listener at the next call, when you can ask Camillo all the questions in February. So, thank you for being on the call.

My name is Maria, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Fiscal Second Quarter 2019 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 8th, 2019.","On today's call are Pierre Laubies, Chief Executive Officer; Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse, Chief Financial Officer and Ayesha Zafar, Group Controller. I would like to remind you that many of the comments today may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to Coty's earnings release and the reports filed with the SEC, where the company lists factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","All commentary on organic net revenue reflect a comparison of the business at constant currency, in the current and prior year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments, as specified in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Laubies.","Pierre Laubies","Thank you, Maria and welcome everybody to Coty's fiscal 2019 second quarter conference call. I'm very happy to be participating on my first earnings call since joining Coty. Actually, it's my first ever earnings call since I've been working private businesses all my life. I'm also very pleased to have Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse here with us as our newly appointed Chief Financial Officer and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 and I will walk you through the second quarter financials and we would together take questions. We also have with us on the call, Ayesha Zafar, who has served us as our Interim CFO over the past five months.","Before diving into the details of our business, let me just acknowledge that I've been with Coty for fewer than 3 months and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 has been with us for one week. So therefore, we are very much still in the learning phase about our business. We will do our best to answer all of your questions on the call today and will expect to do so on the future ones. Today's clearly a bit of an unusual situation and there may be questions that we will need the Investor Relations team to get back to you as appropriate.","Since I joined the company, I've been discovering each part of our business, aiming to assess what is and what is not working and where the opportunities lie in. As a result, I have not yet had the chance to speak to many of you directly, but I look forward to do doing so as we conclude our assessment and finalize our strategic plan.","Before we get into the substance of our last quarter, I thought that it would be appropriate for me to share a bit of my background as well as some introductory remarks and initial observations about Coty. As you may know, I've spent most of my career at Mars where I started in Finance and later became General Manager, Regional President and then Divisional President.","I acquired extensive experience across the world as I operated in France, Russia, Latin America, Broader Europe and eventually globally as I became Global Pet Care President of Mars. I left Mars to become CEO of Douwe Egberts, which became later JDE, after the merger with Mondel\u0113z's coffee business and which also required substantial strategic reconfiguration.","My first experience of business transformation occurred in Russia 23 years ago and it feels like I've been doing little else since that time. I derived from this experiences a few core beliefs. I believe that there is no shortcut to greatness that persistence and consistency are key elements of any successful turnaround plan. I believe that my job together with my leadership team is to lead our organization to mastery, therefore offering space for creativity and innovation so that we can generate lasting growth.","If you examine my tactical elsewhere, while exact financial figures are private, you will find that with the teams I had the privilege to lead, we systematically created value by deploying the same business philosophy that we intend to be applying at Coty. I'm also particularly proud to say that each time I moved on to a new challenge, I'll have very skilled and highly engaged team and the business continued to grow and perform for the year that followed.","Our approach to Coty will be no different. To turn on our business means rapidly refocusing Coty on the fundamentals. My observation is that we can unlock significant value at Coty by running our company better. This will give us the headroom that we needed to address the most strategic issues that we face and capture the opportunity that we see. I must stress to you that while we are confident we can return Coty to a path of growth, we are also realistic that it will take some time. Our luxury and professional beauty businesses are growing reasonably well, but they cannot compensate completely for the difficult trajectory of our consumer beauty division.","In consumer beauty, we need to earn our right to grow again. In that respect, my personal experience has led me to conclude that the path to building a bigger business is always to build a better one. That means producing better products, better advertising, better store execution, better pricing, less complexity, lower cost, more engaged people, simpler organizational design, flatter structure and so on.","So, we'll just do that. We will focus on doing quality business and we will not be obsessed by market shares at any cost. We will refocus our portfolio and make sure that we advertise our power brands at scale. We will strike the right balance between advertising and promotion, but we will ensure that our media choices delivered right amount of reach and frequency, we will create advertising, which cuts through and consistently build our brand asset, we will make sure that our product lines provides the velocity that our retail partners expect from us and we will right size our innovation pipeline to deliver fewer, yet bigger projects.","We already execute on this fundamentals well in our luxury and our professional beauty division, but we need to do that in all our categories, all our markets, all of the time. From a financial standpoint, we will be gross margin obsessed. We clearly understand that gross margin is the lifeblood of the business and that we have a gap here versus our beauty peers that we must close overtime. That means managing revenue and cost, improving product mix and range, shipping higher portfolio and formulation and systematically deploying lean inspired methodologies in our manufacturing and logistics operation.","We will depart from having an experimental culture to one that embraces a disciplined approach, grounded in logic, playbook, standardization and prioritization. I've observed over time that while there are many ways to [indiscernible], there is truly one way to build a great one. In marketing and selling, like in all other functions, our objective will lead to - will be to lead our organization to mastery, we will become experts at what we do and will aim to make sure that all our people clearly know what is expected of them and that they have the tools and methodologies to excel in their job.","I want to stress that I do not see any contradiction between discipline and innovation. On the contrary, I'm quite convinced that discipline enables innovation and maximizes its chance of success. This is very purposely an ambitious agenda. We will deploy these principles whenever possible during the remainder of fiscal 2019, although our main objective is to finalize a strategic plan, which will define our agenda for the medium term.","I have a great deal of confidence that the management team that we have now put in place is the right one to develop this plan. We will leverage the products and the capabilities of each, we will make sure that we have true alignment within our leadership team and across the organization on our roadmap and our way of doing things. I am personally very confident that we can do this, yet, I am also conscious that we need to earn back the trust of our investors.","To achieve this, we will need to build a believable plan, which will be shared with you over the next few months and to build also a technical delivery in the quarters to come. In the meantime, we intend to carry on and deliver profit time recovery in the second half.","Now, let me turn things over to Pierre-Andr\u00e9 who brings deep tactical, he comes to us with nearly 30 years of public company finance experience, including nearly 7 years as the CFO of Danone. We are delighted to have him join Coty at this important, yet exciting junction for our company.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Thank you, Pierre and good morning, everyone and I am excited too to join a company where the potential for value creation is so meaningful, combining challenges, strong brands and teams and opportunities for improvement and this will obviously be a long journey, but every day, since I joined is concerning this impression and I look forward very much to contributing to the new management team and building together in the coming months strong plans and execution.","So on to our second quarter results. In general, I think it's important to say that the quarterly results show continued difficulties, first, but at the same time, they also showed some progress in strengthening our control over the business. We had a number of positive developments in the quarter, including improving visibility and progress on supply chain issues, strong luxury results and improved dynamics in professional beauty.","On a like for like basis, second quarter revenue increased by 0.7% and this strong sequential improvement in the like for like progress was connected to several temporary factors. The addition of Burberry, the positive impact from the monetary change in the revenue recognition policy, the shift of some luxury shipments from the first quarter into the second quarter as a result of US Hurricane Florence and last supply chain related headwinds. We estimate these factors cumulatively benefited our like for like revenue growth rate by approximately 2%, which imply a modest underlying second quarter like for like decline of minus 1.1% for the total company, as was seen for all one-off factors we experienced in the quarter. Year to date like for like revenues were down 3.2%, that's again on an underlying basis. We estimate that the like for like revenues declined approximately 2% in the first half.","Let me get now into a bit more detail on the highlights of the quarter. I'll start with the supply chain disruption, which in November - which we reported in November with four major issues, we drove the business disruption across the three divisions. We now have significantly more visibility around these issues and we can confirm that nearly $150 million of net revenues in the first half of full year '19 represent the majority of the impact we expect for the year.","We've made significant progress in resolving these issues in our luxury warehouse in Germany, such that shipment backlogs have been cleared and capacity constraints are effectively resolved. We do not anticipate any further impact connected to this warehouse during the second half of fiscal 2019. The disruption that we experienced during the ramp up of the consumer beauty planning hub and manufacturing plant in the UK has also been steadily improving and service levels for the current cosmetic portfolio are nearing normalized levels. We expect only minor residual impacts on third quarter results as this consumer beauty supply chain disruption is getting fully resolved.","However, we still have progress to make on the consolidation of a professional beauty distribution center in the US, which continues to negatively impact customer service, particularly for the OPI nail brands. We expect to stabilize OPI service levels during the second half and the teams are working very hard on this as we speak with good progress. I would also recall that there were two external factors last quarter that mainly affected the luxury division. As a result of strategies from component parts suppliers, we continued to experience a deficit of pumps and certain glass bottles and expect this to be an ongoing issue during the second half. We have been assured though by our suppliers that Coty's orders are being very tight with strong capacity in their own plants and we expect to see here again progress. We firmly believe altogether that we have resolved the most critical supply chain integration issues and we are confident that the disruption, which will be solved by year end with a much more moderate impact expected in the second half.","With that for supply chain, I'll now move to luxury with the division which returned to strong 10.8% like for like net revenue growth in the second quarter. The supply chain issues of course continue to be a sizable headwind, but this was more than offset by strong growth in the Burberry in light of very depressed prior year comps as well as US hurricane related impact previously mentioned. On an underlying basis, luxury was still strong, growing approximately 5% in both the quarter and the first half, which is consistent with historical trends.","We continue to see strong growth across many of our programs, including Gucci, Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Chloe supported by robust innovation and execution. Looking at the detail for some of them, in Gucci, we have continued to expand the Bloom pop up and as we enter the second half, key launches include the ultra-premium Calvin Klein collection, Gucci Guilty Revolution, and a select relaunch of items in the Gucci color cosmetic line. In Burberry, the launch of Her is off to a strong start driving improved share trends, particularly in the US, UK and Germany.","01:00 been impacted by the supply chain disruptions, the brand remains a core focus, with a key launch slated from second half.","We continue to see strong ecommerce momentum in the division with online growth well ahead of overall divisional growth, fueled by both traditional retailers and e-commerce pure players. And from a profitability standpoint, luxury continues to drive exceptional financial performance with 41% adjusted operating income growth in the second quarter and 29% in the first half, contributing to a 15.4% adjusted operating margin in the first half. These continue therefore to be a very strong business for us.","Professional beauty next, second quarter like for like trends improved sequentially with a decline of 0.8%, including the negative effect of supply chain disruption. These disruptions are impacting our business, including Wella whereas disproportionately impacted our OPI brands as already mentioned, disrupting sequence of the brands both in North America and internationally. Adjusting for the supply chain disruptions, underlying professional beauty like for like revenues remain consistent at plus 1.5%.","On the positive side, strong improvement in the divisional gross margin supported by product mix and accretive innovation together with fixe cost control drove a 1% increase in the second quarter adjusted operating income, resulting in a 17.3 adjusted margin for the quarter and 12.3 adjusted margin for the first half.","From a brand perspective, Wella continue to benefit from a steady increase in converting certain stores to the Wella current effect with ME+ line. We continue to see growth, strong momentum in GHD across many all countries due by a combination of our platinum plus styler launch, a new brand campaign and growing distribution.","Before I move ahead with consumer, I would like to outline here that together luxury and professional beauty represents 60% of the portfolio and that this 60% of the portfolio are showing solid to strong performance. Let me now focus on the 40% of the business, which is still facing difficulties.","Consumer beauty second quarter like for like results of negative 7.3 improved meaningfully from the 14% decline in first quarter, but was nonetheless a weak result, indicating that we have much work to do to achieve in the division. On an underlying basis, second quarter like for like was a negative 7.8% with Unique contributing to the decline. During the second quarter, the performance was broadly in line with set out trends, as our brands were pressured by continued weakness in the mass beauty category, particularly in the US and Europe. Clear trends have shown a moderation in the pace of our share.","From a category and brand perspective, so color cosmetic declined mid-single digits with CoverGirl and Sally Hansen benefiting from easy comps in the prior year, ahead of their brand relaunches, while Rimmel and Max Factor were weighed down by the supply chain disruptions. In retail hair, Wella trends remain positive with Wella heavily gaining share over the last year helped by innovation. Wella trends at Clairol remain pressured, while net revenues benefited from low comps ahead of last year media relaunch.","In body care, the Brazilian local brands continued their momentum with strong revenue growth once again. Ecommerce was bright spot in consumer beauty with strong growth in the quarter and year to date and share gains from them as well across a number of categories and in our core consumer beauty category.","During the second quarter '19, unit revenues and profits remained pressures, due to a decline in product sales and presence of sponsorship. We continue to refine our product offering and compensation plan structure to drive improvements in present sales activity, recruitment and retention. And from a profit standpoint, consumer beauty second quarter adjusted operating margin totaled 5.6%, as supply pressure and the loss profit contribution from the divested brand more than offset cost reduction.","Our expectation for second half of fiscal 2019 is for both a moderation in supply chain disruptions, as already said and more discipline, strategic approach to our investments, above and below net revenues, which should translate into an improved profit picture in the second half.","Connected to the continued pressure we are seeing at the consumer beauty division, let me briefly touch on the 965 million that are non-cash impairment charge that we are taking this quarter, primarily connected with the consumer beauty division and selected brands, trademarks. The consumer beauty division has experienced increased competitive and market pressure throughout the first half of fiscal '19, which has resulted in weaker than expected revenues and earnings.","Additionally, the discount rate associated with the division has also increased in the quarter. Based on these two factors, management determined that there were indications that the goodwill of the division as well as certain trademarks, intangible assets may be impaired and accordingly an interim goodwill impairment test was performed as of December 31, 2018. The charge announced today reflect non-cash impairment charge of 832 million for the consumer beauty goodwill and 97.8 million to the trademarks of CoverGirl, Clairol, and two small regional brands.","While this charge clearly had a material impact on reported operating profit, our adjusted operating income excludes this charge of course. Second quarter adjusted operating income was 322.3 million, declined by 7% from the prior year with a margin of 12.8%, bringing first half adjusted operating income to $463 million and an adjusted margin of 10.2%.","In the first half, the adjusted operating income was adversely impacted by temporary factors of approximately $48 million, including over 19 million from the supply chain disruption. Excluding these temporary impacts, the first half underlying adjusted operating income declined about 6% year-over-year with an operating margin of approximately 11%.","We anticipate our profit trend recovering in the second half compared with the first half. Our second quarter adjusted net income $181.9 million declined 23% versus the prior year, primarily due to a $41.8 million positive foreign tax settlement in the prior year, which is not sure of course. Interest expense was modestly higher than last year as a result of our higher debt balance, while net income attributable to minority interest was declining due to the decrease in unique profitability. As a result of all these, adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.24 per share.","I'll now comment on the improvement in our net debt during the quarter. Debt decreased in the second quarter due to approximately $320 million of operating cash flow and $195 million of free cash flow generated during the quarter as we drove strong conversion of operating income into operating cash flow, supported by working capital improvements. Our team remains focused on free cash flow as deleveraging is a strong priority for Coty and the most important lever for value creation for both equity and debt orders in the short term.","Like Pierre, I believe that more discipline and systematic focus on cash will meaningfully enhance our cash flow in the medium term. This in turn will free up resources to both invest behind our brands and to expand our profits.","Net debt of $7,498 million on December 31, 2018 decreased $173 million from the balance of $7,662 million on September 31, 2018, resulting in the last 12 months net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.8 times. The reduction in net debt reflects positive free cash flow, the payment of $94 million dividend and the positive foreign exchange impact relating to the part of our net debt, which is in euro. Our covenant adjusted net leverage ratio remains, as a result of all these, below our threshold and we have entire liquidity available under our revolver with no significant debt maturities until 2023.","Let me to finish also some final color on our fiscal 2019 outlook. As we focus on building a healthier business model, we anticipate profit trend recovery in the second half of full year 2019. We expect that full year 2019 constant currency adjusted operating income will be moderately below last year adjusted operating income of $1 billion. And we continue to expect positive free cash flow for full year 2019 and for the rest of the year.","Before wrapping up, let me quickly review mainly our key priorities for the remainder of the year. The first of course is to fully resolve the supply chain issues and on this front, we are making very good progress, which will need to be carefully monitored in the third quarter. Collectively, as a team, we will work toward delivering the profit target I just mentioned. My own growth focus, as a CFO, will be on improving free cash flow generation as part of our commitment to deleveraging and finally as mentioned several times by Pierre, and under his leadership, we will spend the next few months assessing the risk and opportunities of the business and building medium term plans with a focus on gross margin, adjusted operating income and free cash flow.","That's what I wanted to tell you as a comment for this second quarter. And with that, let's move to Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Pierre, maybe you can just, I know it's still early, but as you've come in and looked at the businesses, just wanted to get your assessment on the consumer insights capabilities at Coty today, and maybe on a scale of 1 to 10, where would you rank it. Obviously, 10 being the best. And just from the CoverGirl perspective, obviously, it was relaunched, it looked like it had some early success, just wanted to get the state of the union on how that relaunch is progressing?","Pierre Laubies","Nik, thank you very much for this question. So when it comes to consumer insight capabilities, I think that we have, based on my superficial assessment and I will be very cautious about what I say, I think our assessment of where the market is going, where - what are the consumer trends and that is it that we need to do is probably reasonably good. So I'll give it 6 or 7, I mean if I wanted to rank it. I do happen to believe that where all opportunities lie is how to transform this insight into a consistent marketing strategy, a disciplined opportunity to brand building, a discipline opportunity to portfolio management and I would say, yeah, and a disciplined media approach overall. So that's kind of what I think of new opportunities, not [indiscernible] but how we transform them into concrete action.","When it comes to CoverGirl, I have to say I think this is an amazing brand and this has had a lot of scale, a lot of opportunities, not only in the US market, but I'm talking from intuition here and so I accept that this is sort of answer first answer. I think that brand, as we hear, a lot of potential, it is very distinctive. It has really strong international expansion capabilities. So I think that we have a very strong asset here. When it comes to the re-launch, I think - I would say that the assessment is a bit less clear at this stage. We are not happy with the development of the brand. I know distribution plays into that, but I think that there are also some issues the way we market that brand from a structural standpoint. Again, you come back to the same conversation we had, maybe our choices, building on not a distinctive asset of the brand and velocity of our sales and complexity of our branch. So we are taking stock of that, but again, I think the team is quite conscious of some of the trajectory that we have with that brand. We really believe it deserves better and we will work strongly to turn it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Coyne of BMO Capital Markets.","Shannon Coyne","Pierre, you talked about introducing playbooks in a more standardized, disciplined approach to the business. Can you give more details on what that means and maybe talk about how that marries up with being in beauty, which is often a changing and a dynamic industry?","Pierre Laubies","Actually thank you, Shannon for this very good question. Playbooks talks of the way on how we do business, not - nothing else. Beauty is a pretty world and so is music, all right and nobody can play into a [indiscernible] without mastering music, right, or the feeling of music and learning music. This is a bit of the same analogy. What we need to do is to have strong standout ways of doing things, organization everything which matters, the why, the how and the what, the why is it very clear, why we are in the business, why does the company exist and in general, it's relatively easy to answer this question.","The what is what makes the difference, if I want to sell more CoverGirl, I need to do something with range, we need to do something with the pies, we need to do something with the distribution, we need to do something with recipes, that's the what and that's where we spend most of all, we must spend most of our time. Large organizations face complexity, complexity is the ransom of success and with complexity comes complexity of businesses, complexity of processes and complexity of organization. And that's what the how operates.","What we don't want is to have people who disclose on how they have to perform their job, we want them to really master that by giving them a marketing philosophy, a selling philosophy, a manufacturing philosophy or finance philosophy or whatever it counts, all right. And so that's what we are going to do in this company. We need to invest a bit at the initial phase, but it will free up a lot of time and a lot of energy, so we can focus on selling more beauty.","Shannon Coyne","And just real quick, can you give us some sense of how, based on the guidance you gave today, how Q3 and Q4 plays out?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","I'll take that. It's going to be skewed towards Q4 clearly, there are different reasons for that, one of them being the supply chain resolution, which is obviously going to improve. There will be some impact as well as revenue recognition due to the change of norm, there is going to have different impacts throughout the quarter, as we normalizing it. And some cost saving as well. Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Pierre-Andr\u00e9, I know you've been there only a week as you pointed out, but a couple of questions for you. First, just thoughts on capital allocation, sort of where does the dividend fit in on your priority list. Also, I noticed in the release the net debt to EBITDA target that's been there, in the past was not mentioned, so is there any change to that? And then also just that you were willing to step up and kind of - you adjusted the full year guidance a little bit lower, but like you said, there is this implied significant acceleration, so why do that at this point, you're very new, you don't have to. So maybe just offer up your level of conviction, the drivers that really kind of get you to be comfortable, giving an outlook at this point in time. Thanks.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","So I'll start - it's a competent question actually. I'll start with the last one. It's true I've been here for a week, but the company has not started working for a week on me. And Pierre by the way joined 3 months ago and for that 3 months, there's been a lot of things happening, in particular in reassessing the short term performance of the business, gaining a more realistic view of what's beyond delivering and putting in place plans to support the profitability and the profit delivery and to support as well the delivery of cash.","So for the last one week and I must say a bit more than one week to be pretty frank, I've been wrapping on that work, meeting many people and getting to the conclusion that they're very solid plans and this is a reason why we feel comfortable in saying what we have been saying about the profit delivery, which means 950 million to 1 billion operating income target for the year and indeed an improvement in the second half, but it's pretty logical and very easy. You see that consumer beauty Q2 is already improving versus Q1. You see that, as we move forward, we are getting less impact from the supply chain issues and as a result of that, you can see what the trend is going to be in the second half. So this is why we are comfortable reassuring the market on that and somehow confirming the resilience of the business, which we have seen in the second quarter.","On your other question, which are a bit more long term, so on capital allocation and dividend, very simply, no intention to touch the dividend. My - sorry in the financial dividend and capital allocation, the return to shareholders is a very important matter and we take it very seriously. As we take very seriously de-leveraging and today I have no reason to question what's in place. We are focusing on free cash flow generation to match these two objectives of the financial policy.","On the net debt target change, I believe you're talking of the medium term guidance. As mentioned by Pierre, we are going to make a strategic assessment of the company in the coming months and obviously this will result in conclusion in the cash flow generation and what we want to do with it and therefore, I don't want to confirm before we have made this plan. Whatever target medium term will be, I just want - I simply want to note that we have a set of targets from a covenant perspective, which anyway leads us to net debt to EBITDA ratio which are gradually going down, as we move in time. So that remains in place of course. I hope I have covered your question with my answer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Could you talk about your initial sense for the portfolio of brands? Do you have a feel for whether you just have too many brands to manage, too many different lines of business and I'm particularly curious if you have an initial take on the hair coloring business because that seems to be particularly challenge and maybe particularly a competitive category where it might be difficult to regain some momentum?","Pierre Laubies","Thank you, Wendy for this question. I think it is, we - indeed as you have said, we don't suffer from a lack of brands at Coty. But probably, we do suffer from the lack of portfolio structure, right. So I think this is what we are going to assess during this strategic plan. I believe that if you want to manage or to achieve a solid market share at any given market, yes, you do need to have brands, but you do need to have the well-structured portfolio of brands aligning with the price tiering of the marketplaces and unfortunately, I think that over the year, this has not been the strategy that Coty has followed, some of competitors have not followed this strategy, because it is a good one. All right. So, I think that this is something that we need to work on.","We will definitely come back to you when we evaluate our strategy and the share of strategy with that way of looking at the market and I do happen to believe that in that case, Coty is very well placed. We have a few hidden gems into the organization or into the business that we can capitalize on and to build, I would call it, structured portfolio, which has the capability to become global, providing we give it the focus that it deserves. That is my answer first with your question.","And I understand also that there are settled brands that we have, which are probably non-strategic. In this type of situation, I think you have to be pragmatic, all right. You can't - this brand generic cash flow, so we need that cash flow, so we will continue to manage them. Some of these might also going to be off storm, but are local. I don't mind that at all. I think you can have also a set of local bond, providing they are well managed and you manage them not as a global brand, but you manage them as you would manage a global brand at the local level. And again, this is what the value of a playbook give, which gives people to the methodologies and way of doing things, which are actually, whatever you apply it on the core of your brand, you could apply it on [indiscernible] in Germany. And so that's my approach to this sort of problem and I think that was your first question.","On hair calling, yes, we clearly - we had a great idea in the US market, definitely with the Clairol move, typically our execution has been a bit challenging and we have unfortunately, we have, in the case of Clairol, particularly in the US market, we have gained penetration with the relaunch of Clairol but we have upset some traditional users of the main partition of the market, as they call it and we have lost business. It is a glad example of why your playbook matters and then you avoid this sort of problem. I think it is a category where we have a right to win, we have capabilities, we have competences and we have potentially, we have some, I would call it, local brand with Clairol in the UK and in the US. I don't see any reason why we can't beat the global portfolio on this category, taking into consolation our success in professional hair color, I'm absolutely convinced that we can take this to the mass market and again it will be clearly part of our strategy. I will again see that as a great opportunity in terms of growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Earlier, you chose not to talk about a medium term leverage target, maybe you could talk even longer term than that. Philosophically, where do you believe that this company should be levered? And then I guess if I could just get an update on the P&G integration, we were expecting 225 million of savings in '19, do you know what was achieved in the first half and therefore what we might expect to see in the second half? That's all. Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Just on the first part of your question and I'll let Ayesha answer the second part about synergy. I have no philosophy. I mean, it basically depends on the business and its ability to deliver cash flow. So entering the problem or the question with theoretical conviction, to me doesn't make sense. I want first to go through what is reality of this business to deliver cash flow, what is a need for investment, what is the ability to deliver sustainable earnings and growth and then depending on the outcome, we need to define what is the right level of leverage we want to put in place and what is one we can put in place from a realistic standpoint. So that's why I am not willing to go much further than that and we'll discuss that once we have numbers.","Ayesha, do you want to answer on?","Ayesha Zafar","Yes. So just the answer on synergies, we were expecting about 225 for the year and we are on track0. So I would say roughly half, but that's just to give you a sense, that's how we were expecting it to work out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Wanted to ask about the gross margin focus, so that suggests perhaps freeing some funds up for flexibility in the business, including reinvestment, whether it's incremental or just a continuation. I guess I'm curious if that's reasonable, if that's kind of how you view, the business and if so or even if not, how do you think about the EBIT margin longer term, as I think your predecessors seem to have what I think in the industry was viewed as a bit of unrealistic expectations about high single digit EBIT margins, do you think that that is still the right number, sort of directional, not looking for specifics, but what is the right level of margin for the business, what's the right level of reinvestment for the business, that would be helpful?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","I'll take the first part of the question and then I'll let Pierre elaborate on gross margin and the engine, but again I don't want to make the answer before we have entered the exact size, but what we are all clear about is that we think there is meaningful - there is room for meaningful improvement of the operating margin and this is ours actually. We want to take this company at the level of EBIT margin, which is going to be meaningfully higher than the one we have today and a substantial part of that is going to come from gross margin, another part of that is going to come from the simplification of the costs basically and from fixed costs and from fixed costs leverage by the way as well.","For gross margin, my only comment and Pierre will elaborate more is that if we want to be the business of quality, we need to have the ability to invest behind this and if we want to have the ability to invest behind this, we want to have available gross margin, which is higher and that is simple as that. So the question is already answered, we're just second.","Pierre Laubies","Exactly Pierre-Andr\u00e9 and Mark, thanks for the question. It's almost a point, a strong point of view that I've developed over the years is that and reinforce into this category, looking at this category in detail, beauty is an expensive business from an NCP standpoint, you need to be able to compete in to this area. You don't mean that you need to waste and we don't need to, we don't intend to, but clearly, we need to strengthen our ability to talk to our consumers or to build our brand with our consumers. And in that respect, deliver earnings, sustain gross margin and ever improving gross margin, I mean, it is, we need to make a step and that will go to a strategy of continuous improvement through many levers being strategic quality management, costing, simplification of our ACPs, simplification of formulation, prediction of our cost, I mean, we have to, in a strategy like that, you don't leave any stone unturned and we will just do that. But clearly, we are in the business of brand building and as Pierre-Andr\u00e9 said, that takes money and at the same time, we also want to deleverage our company, pay dividends and improve our profitability. So again, I see that as the place to go to and we will do that in the not-too-distant future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much and you kind of touched on my question just now, but maybe let me try to ask it again and knowing it's early days. So, again philosophically speaking, you made a couple of key big picture comments before the Q&A section. One, you want to earn the right to grow in consumer business. Two, you're not obsessed with market share and three, you are obsessed with gross margin. And I guess what I'm struggling with a little bit and again you touched on it here is what do you mean in terms of right to grow in consumer business, does it mean that you have the brands that the consumers want or does it mean that you have the profitability first, there's kind of a chicken and egg situation there and if you stand back and look at some of those comments, you're not obsessed with market share, but you are obsessed with gross margin, does that mean that you want to be more aggressive, perhaps in terms of pricing. So again, I know you touched on it a little bit before, but if you could just kind of help us think through those various objectives, particularly in the short term. I understand long term, you want to drive the gross margin long term, but over the next 12 months, how are those different priorities fitting together please?","Pierre Laubies","Thank you very much, Robert for this question. When I say I'm not obsessed with market share is, I mean by that that I'm obsessed with quality business, all right. And the good business, we all know that they are good business and they are in bad business. Well, we all need to do, we all need to focus on doing good business and we are going to forfeit very, very bad business and we are going to limit that business. So, I think we need to be pragmatic on this dimension, but it's really physically the guidance that we give to our people. I actually don't see any compatibility between doing that and having gross margin. Actually, I think it is the lifeblood of gross margin too and gross margin is in turn the lifeblood of building plants. All right, or building portfolios.","So I see that philosophically, sort of 2 times if I may say so or 3 times, 3 times strategy. Clearly spend the next 6 months assessing all points of difficulty, market by market, assessing our portfolio, market by market, where is the space to go, where are the opportunities. Immediately, at the same time, but that would take another couple of years I would say, focus on the quality of the business with the portfolio that we have today and optimizing its performance in terms of quality market share and not only in terms of total market share, I mean mostly in that case, I mean the market share of the base business and versus the incremental one.","And at the same time, once we have done all these, really build an innovation program or a transformation program from a portfolio standpoint that we will be able to deploy in a period of time, starting from I would say 18 months to the next - to the rest of our life or 18 months to 2 years. You need to extract it and see and consistency over that. We have too many markets where we only have one brand and we can find competitors, we have 2 or 3 brands, with only one brand, that's not going to work. And so we need to be to the opposition in the marketplace and again, you don't move - CoverGirl is a brand which has 17% penetration in the US market. It was launched 78 years ago, if I do remember when, all right. So I think that takes time, right, and of course I do not intend to wait that long and to see success, but clearly, I do see that series of events and we all - which all work concomitantly with different parts of the organization working on each specific agenda item.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","So Pierre, we seem to be hearing two things. So on the one hand, it seems that you want to invest to help build a better company and some of that can likely be sourced by lean initiatives, but given where you stand now versus competition, especially in consumer beauty, it also seems that that would require a good deal of upfront investment and I think that's implied by the lower operating profit outlook today. So I guess the first question is do you agree with that assessment.","And the second question is, how do you balance that desire to improve and the potential need to invest against your de-leveraging priorities and to what expand is elevated that sort of constraining, what you would otherwise like to do and how do you sort of break through those constraints?","Pierre Laubies","Yeah. Maybe Pierre-Andr\u00e9 will take the question first.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","I don't see the investment as anything to do with the profitability as you mentioned. The profitability incorporates a very important factor, which is the supply chain issue. So I think that's the main reason for the profitability of this year rather than profitability of last year.","On the constraints, that's basically what we have on the agenda. We have strong commitments on the leveraging standpoint. We have ambition from the profitability of this company and we know that we need to find ways to, at the same time, invest and deliver and do it in a balanced manner. So this is very much what we are going to try and work in the coming weeks and we are going to try and incorporate in the strategic review, we are doing that usual constraint business and you cannot invest everything upfront and because that would be taking too much risk, you need to do it in a gradual manner and have the delivery coming at the same time. So maybe Pierre, you want to complement on that.","Pierre Laubies","Faiza, good question. I think that I alluded to what I've said earlier in my initial statement, we have space to improve the performance of our business by working differently, all right. In our ANCP budget, yes, we are not short of ANCP, yes, we could have more, I mean, that's not a problem. But our balance between working media and non-working media has to be improved, our balance between reach and frequency has to be improved, our balance between the different type of media can be improved. So we have space in our P&L and we have space in our execution. We will see that space, those spaces and I think it will free up not only cash to be honest with you or money to be spent, but also it will save us from a lot of waste, all right. And I think with waste comes fatigue and with fatigues comes lower performance and our objective is actually to fundamentally eliminate waste and hence refocusing our organization and our people to really what makes the difference.","Pierre Laubies","Okay. With that, we thank you all and we will see you on the road. Thank you. Bye, bye.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Thank you so much all for your time.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"6338":["Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call May  8, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Pierre Laubies - Chief Executive Officer","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Russell Miller - RBC Capital Markets","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Andrea Teixeira - J.P. Morgan","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Maria and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's fiscal third quarter 2019 results conference call.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today May 8th, 2019.","On today's call are Pierre Laubies, Chief Executive Officer, and Pierre-Andre Terisse, Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of the comments today may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to Coty's earnings release and the reports filed with the SEC where the company lists factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","All commentary on like-for-like net revenue reflect the comparison of the business at constant currency in the current and prior-year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.","In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflects certain adjustments as specified in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Laubies.","Pierre Laubies","Thank you, Maria, and welcome everybody to Coty's fiscal 2019 third conference call. I will provide an update on my observations over the last three months and Pierre-Andre will walk you through the third quarter financials and fiscal year 2019 outlook. And then, together, we will take your questions.","The close of the third quarter comes only a few months after the new senior management team has been put in place, and I'm pleased with how we, as a senior leadership team, have coalesced as we collectively identify and prioritize the strategic opportunities ahead for Coty.","Since the last earnings call, my team and I have analyzed in detail some of our key markets and business unit, and have spent time with our business leaders aiming to understand better the business opportunities ahead, as well as the root causes of our issues, which are mostly centered around Consumer Beauty as 60% of our business is performing solidly.","At this stage, we're already convinced of a few things. First, our analytics show that we have significant upside potential in shelf productivity, sales, and gross margin by simply optimizing what we currently sell even without substantial innovation, while simplifying our assortment and promotion tactics.","Second, we have a real and immediate opportunity to focus our brand-building efforts behind a more limited number of brand-country combinations and to invest behind them at scale.","We have already begun activating this approach in the third quarter as we shifted our media dollars from non-priority businesses and increase media investment for priority brand-country combinations.","Third, we have identified a real upside in business simplification as our analysis has shown that our prior focus on short-term growth has led, over time, to an overly complex product range to excessive proliferation of sub-ranges and SKU expansion. We are convinced that, by addressing this complexity, we will unlock substantial opportunity for cost saving and shelf productivity improvement.","Finally, and most importantly, our people at Coty are skilled and have a very strong result orientation. They value our business approach based on data, which, in turn, enable them to grown on their creativity and rigorous insight. So, we think that they will respond well to our agenda.","As we get closer to the completion of Coty's strategic plan, I can, therefore, already confirm, as substantiated by our analytics and market visit, that our initial intuitions were correct. We are more than ever convinced that the core business principles which were outlined in the last quarter's earnings call are the most relevant levers to maximize value creation in the short and medium term and, of course, starting as much as possible in fiscal year 2020.","This principle include driving a better business before a bigger one, being gross margin obsessed, and building brands through selective and scaled investments.","We all truly think that Coty is a company which has short and medium-term earning improvement potential and we'll immediately focus our energy and resources on capturing this upside.","Yet, we also understand that we need to raise Coty's growth ceiling to have a long-term future. This is a more strategic task that will take more time to achieve. We will make sure that we address our longer-term growth potential, while we deliver on our more immediate turnaround plans.","Now, turning to the third quarter. Our results clearly indicate that supply chain issues are largely resolved, and we are pleased to say that we expect very limited impact from supply chain disruption in the remainder of the year.","Performance this quarter also shows the increased control that we have over our cost structure both in term of G&A, as well as proactive management of A&CP.","Taken together, these factors have allowed us to deliver solid adjusted operating income, in line with the expectations we laid out last quarter.","However, while we are pleased with this quarter's profit delivery, unsurprisingly, the weak top line shows that there is still much to be done to turnaround the business, specifically in Consumer Beauty, as I discussed previously.","I want to assure you that we will take no shortcuts. And although we won't be slow, we will also aim for consistent results over time. We indeed have much work to do. And as I said earlier, beyond running our operations effectively, our focus now is to ensure that we have a reliable strategy going forward. This should be completed towards the end of June, and I look forward to speaking with many of you as we roll out the communication of our strategic plan.","With that, I will turn it over to Pierre-Andre.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse ","Thank you, Pierre. And good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be with you today again to comment on our Q3 earnings.","I'll go to page 3 of the deck. As Pierre mentioned, third quarter financial results were consistent with the expectation we laid out on the second quarter earning call. And importantly, supply chain disruptions had minimal impact on our operation.","Our focus this quarter was squarely on profit and cash flow delivery. So, while the top trends remain weak, we are pleased that the actions we undertook delivered the expected profits and a strong free cash flow.","Additionally, consistent with our deleveraging objective, we're initiating a stock dividend reinvestment program giving shareholders the option to receive their full dividend in cash or to receive their dividend in 50% cash and 50% common stock.","Our quarterly dividend will stand at $0.125 per share or $0.50 on an annual basis. And shareholders will need to make their choice on a quarterly basis beginning with the third quarter dividend payment in June.","Overall, on revenue, third quarter revenues declined minus 3.7% on a like-for-like basis. This top line result included approximately 2 percentage points of negative impact from the change in revenue recognition accounting and reflected unfavorable COGS in Luxury for the quarter.","Underlying trends were very much in line with that of the previous quarter, with a strong Luxury division, a Professional Beauty division recovering from low service levels and a continuing weaknesses in the Consumer Beauty division.","Going forward, in the rest of fiscal 2019, we expect top line like-for-like trends to be tracking in a similar range as in Q3. Our main focus for now remains profit and cash flow, while we are finalizing our strategy review and getting prepared to improve the support behind key brands and overall top line as we move into fiscal 2020.","Despite these continuing top line pressures, Q3 adjusted operating income of $230 million was in line with last year, thanks to smaller impacts from supply chain disruptions and tight cost management.","With the supply chain disruption impact now largely behind us, we expect the total impact for fiscal 2019 to be approximately $150 million of lost sales and approximately $100 million of lost profit.","I do want to caution that we do not expect to fully recover lost sales and profit in fiscal 2020, but rather steadily, very gradually improving our customer relationship and service levels quarter after quarter.","I will now turn to the divisional performance, starting with Luxury, page 4. The Luxury division maintained its mid-single digit growth trends, with like-for-like revenues of 2.8% on a high comparison base and including an approximately 1% headwind from temporary factors.","Solid third quarter results were supported by continued strength in Burberry, Gucci and Calvin Klein, and the return to solid growth in Hugo Boss as supply chain disruption abated and the brand regained momentum beyond the launch of Boss Bottled Infinite which you see on the left of the screen.","The continued sell-out strength of Chlo\u00e9 Nomade and Marc Jacobs' Daisy drove sustained share gains across multiple markets.","On Marc Jacobs, I'm very pleased that we recently renewed the Marc Jacobs fragrance license, reinforcing the strength and longevity of the Luxury brand portfolio and Coty's position as a licensee of choice for leading fashion houses.","We also continued to see great momentum in our Luxury e-commerce sales, which continued to increase as a percentage of total sales.","Last, we're very excited about the launch of our new Gucci lipstick collection, which represents our latest collaboration with Gucci Creative Director, Alessandro Michele. The collection features a wide range of shades and finishes and represents the first step in our relaunch of the Gucci makeup line.","Slide 5, from a profitability standpoint, the Luxury division, significant improvement in operating income and margin expansion, both in the third quarter and year-to-date, highlights the division's strong operating leverage.","Third quarter adjusted operating income of $126 million increased 26% versus the prior year, driven by the combination of gross margin improvement on cost of sales savings linked with supply chain integration and solid fixed cost reduction.","This profit expansion was consistent with a year-to-date Luxury operating income growth of 28%, driving a year-to-date adjusted operating margin of 16%, which marks a 310 bps improvement from the prior year.","I'll now turn to Consumer Beauty, slide 6. In Consumer Beauty, the third quarter like-for-like decline of 10% included approximately 300 bps of negative impact from temporary factors, implying a high-single digit underlying like-for-like decline in both the third quarter and year-to-date.","This performance continues to be broadly in line with sell-out trends as our brands remain pressured by continued weaknesses in the global mass beauty market, particularly in the US and Europe, even as we continue to see moderation in the pace of our share losses.","Younique revenues and profits were down year-over-year, driven by declines in presenter sponsorship. Although we continue to refine our product offering in an effort to improve presenter recruitment and retention, the turnaround of Younique remains a key focus.","Despite these poor overall results, there were a few positive brand performance in the quarter, and one particularly with Brazil. Our Brazilian local brands grew sell-out and continued their share gain trajectory.","This quarter, net revenue growth in Brazil was significantly higher as we lapped the decline in third quarter fiscal year 2018 when Brazil net revenues were temporarily depressed following our pricing intervention.","And Wella Retail grew sales and share in both hair coloring and hair styling with particular strength in ALMEA, driven by recent innovation, including the addition of a Root Touch-Up range to the Wella portfolio.","On slide 7, the third quarter adjusted operating income of $56 million declined from $97 million in the prior year, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 6.6%. This decline included a $23 million impact year-over-year from the revenue recognition accounting change.","While disappointing, this result does reflect significant reductions in fixed cost and active prioritization of the A&CP, which we will continue in the fourth quarter as we pilot the business in parallel with the strategic plan.","I must stress here that, even as we emphasize profit delivery of the top line in the near term, our goal over time is to use a portion of our profit growth to reinvest in the business and drive a healthy and consistent top line trajectory, and this as soon as next year.","Turning to Professional Beauty, slide 8. Revenues declined modestly on a like-for-like basis with most of the success in North America business. Excluding the temporary factors, the decline is linked to the lingering impact of supply chain disruptions as well as trade inventory reduction at a few key customers.","While it will take some time to rebuild the customer relationships, we're confident that the Professional business is on solid ground and our brands are fundamentally healthy. ","With service levels now largely restored for OPI, the brand returned to strong growth and we continued to enjoy very strong momentum in ghd with the launch of the ghd Glide hot-brush in the quarter and the continued success of the Platinum+ styler.","Wella innovation also continues to perform very well.","Slide 9, Professional Beauty adjusted operating income grew 57% to $47 million with the adjusted operating margin up 450 bps to 11.2%. This was driven by strong gross margin expansion and good fixed cost reduction.","Despite close to a $30 million impact from supply chain disruptions and foreign exchange, the year-to-date Professional Beauty adjusted operating income grew over 18%, resulting in 240 bps of margin improvements to 12%.","I'm now moving to the overall Coty P&L, slide 10. The third quarter adjusted gross margin of 62.9% was lower by 140 bps versus the third quarter of last year as last year gross margin was unusually high, given weak sales in the lower margin Consumer Beauty Brazil business.","Sequentially, however, our gross margin improved versus last quarter by 80 bps, reflecting continued margin expansion in Luxury and Professional Beauty.","Year-to-date adjusted gross margin of 61.8% was still down 60 bps versus 2018, driven primarily by the supply chain disruption in the early part of the year.","As mentioned earlier, we focused this quarter on delivering profit and protecting working media investments. And we, on the other hand, proactively reduced other key expenditures, including non-working media and other fixed costs.","Adjusted operating income of $230 million was in line with the prior year, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 5%.","Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.13 was in line with last year with profit, interest, and tax expense all stable year-over-year and minority interest expense lower [ph] in the third quarter reflecting the weakness of Younique.","Slide 11, for the year-to-date. Year-to-date adjusted operating income of $693 million declined by 10% from the prior year, including foreign exchange headwinds of approximately 4% with an adjusted operating margin of 10.6%. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange, the amount would have been $724 million.","I'm now going to cash flow, slide 12. So, turning to cash flow and balance sheet. Cash from operations grew by over $300 million year-over-year to a total of $214 million. This improvement reflected the impact of working capital management initiatives, including a solid improvement in the aging of our underlying receivables and the contribution of approximately $110 million from the receivables factoring program.","This cash flow performance, coupled with the $50 million decline in CapEx, drove third quarter free cash flow of $142 million for the quarter and $121 million year-to-date, despite over $300 million of one-time cash outflows during the same period.","The third quarter free cash flow performance, net of our $94 million dividend payment, resulted in approximately $30 million of cash available for debt pay-down.","And with favorable FX improvement in quarters, our net debt decreased by $100 million from the end of the second quarter to total net debt of $7.4 million.","This resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 5.7 times, slightly lower than our second quarter ratio. And importantly, our covenant adjusted leverage ratio remains comfortably below our permitted threshold.","Having been immersed in the business for several months now and getting involved in the formulation of the strategic plan mentioned by Pierre, I'm pleased to confirm our medium-term target of a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of less than 4 times, which will be achieved through a combination of EBITDA growth and net debt paydown.","Slide 13, as discussed earlier, we are initiating a stock dividend reinvestment program this quarter. Shares will trade ex-dividend June 6 with an election deadline on June 20 and payment on June 28th.","Alongside this decision, JAB, our largest shareholder, has informed us that they will elect to receive 50% of their dividend in common stock, and this until we have reached our targeted leverage of less than 4 times in the debt to adjusted EBITDA.","The introduction of the stock dividend shows JAB is fully supportive of Coty deleveraging priority and of our medium-term leverage target.","We anticipate, thanks to that, annual cash saving of $112 million from JAB action alone, and we expect this will result in only modest potential dilution in the coming quarters.","This decision, together with the increased focus on the generation of free cash flow and the first result obtained in this third quarter, emphasize the importance of deleveraging for the new Coty management.","It also confirms our dividend policy, which we view as an important component of shareholder remuneration and which expresses our confidence in the earning prospect of Coty.","Slide 14, on the key recent developments. This election by JAB to support our deleveraging target by participating in the stock dividend reinvestment program comes, as you have seen, after the close of JAB tender offer.","Having acquired 150 million shares, JAB now owns 60% of Coty outstanding shares. And as stated by them, the tender offer was a very clear expression of JAB confidence and support of Coty.","I will conclude, slide 15, with the outlook. As we look to the remainder of the year, the delivery of these Q3 results give us confidence in our guidance for fiscal 2019, with an adjusted operating income expected to be between $950 million and $1 billion at constant currency, which implies a solid profit performance in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite expected continued weakness in top line.","We also continue to expect positive free cash flow for fiscal 2019 with solid free cash flow generation in the final quarter of the year.","As said, our objective in this second half of 2019 has been, and remain, to protect profit and cash flow, and we are successful in getting control over those.","Beyond 2019, we see as essential the recovery of our top line. And this is another objective we've been working on, in particular in the context of the strat plan we are preparing. We expect to report back to you on this as well as on our overall plans for the coming year around the end of June.","With that, we are now ready for questions and get on the line for it. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC.","Russell Miller","Hi. This is Russ Miller on for Nik. ","Pierre Laubies","Good morning.","Russell Miller","Hi. We were wondering if you could comment in more detail on how working, advertising and promotion spend during the quarter compared to a year ago and what your plans are for working A&P over the coming quarters? And then, I have a follow-up if you don't mind. ","Pierre Laubies","Thank you for the question. If I remember well my figures, I think our working media are broadly in line with what they were last year for the quarter. And, clearly, there has been some reallocation between categories. I think they were probably up in Luxury and slightly down in Consumer Beauty. And non-working media has been, basically speaking, fairly down. I think that we have reduced them quite substantially, mostly because, at the same time, we already had a lot of assets in place. And that's, basically speaking, reduced sample testers and things like that which are not that positive necessarily all the time.","So, going forward, I think we probably \u2013 again, this year, I'll be honest, we are managing a pragmatic line between delivering our financial objective target and doing as much as we want from a media standpoint. So, we will always aim at maximizing our working media. But, clearly, our objective \u2013 and you will see, we just have hypothesis at this stage until -- since we don't have approval yet of our operating plan for fiscal year 2020. But our fiscal year our assumption today for 2020 is a substantial increase in our working media versus last year.","Russell Miller","That's helpful. Thank you. And as a follow-up, were there any incremental distribution losses or new headwinds that weighed on the Consumer business during the quarter since we last spoke and should be mindful of going forward? Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","No. At this stage, nothing. And we have \u2013 the main thing that we have done with the team is that we have engaged with most of our customers during the last period. And as communicated, some elements of our strategies which have been, I think, well received. And, clearly, as I alluded in my speech, really, I do believe that we have a lot of opportunities focusing on productivity of our current shelf layout. And, clearly, this is behind which \u2013 an item behind which the whole team is really focused at this stage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. My first question is just on the share dividend. Does the fact that JAB is going to participate in that up to 50%, does that change at all their agreement to be capped out at a certain ownership level based on the recent tender offer?","Pierre Laubies","No, it does not.","Wendy Nicholson","Okay. And then, my second question is actually on \u2013 so they go up to a maximum of 69% ownership, is that the right number?","Pierre Laubies","Yeah.","Wendy Nicholson","Okay. Got it. And then, my second question is just on the Luxury side. That business, I know, has been very lumpy and there have been some distribution issues and the supply chain disruptions have sort of wreaked havoc on that business. But still, we've seen a couple of the other sort of fragrance companies have a little bit slower growth in the fragrance segment over the last quarter or two. And the 3% number of like-for-like growth you've quoted is again a little bit on the lower end than what we have been expecting. So, can you just talk about sort of the fragrance category \u2013 luxury fragrance category generally? It's coming off a couple of years of really strong growth. Do you think that sustains? Do you think fragrance may be softening? Just a few comments on the category as a whole. Thanks.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yeah. It's Pierre-Andr\u00e9. Just to comment on the base and the numbers and then I'll let Pierre elaborate. Last quarter, if I'm not mistaken, we had Luxury at around 10%, which was fairly high \u2013 high-single digits, which was fairly high and in excess of what we see as their underlying pace, which is around 5%. This quarter is below, but it's all a question of comparison base. Last year, we had, in Q3, a lot of launches. In Q2, we had a weak Burberry and, therefore, that gives different numbers. Underlying, we continue seeing Luxury between 4% and 5%. This is what we have as underlying trend and this is what we expect for the year.","So, no. For me, you should not read anything in the numbers in terms of decline. It remains a strong business. And then, I can let Pierre elaborate on that.","Pierre Laubies","Yeah. I think luxury as a category has been growing at 3% over the last 12 months. And the combination of both quarters, last quarter and previous quarter, at 3% too. I suspect there are dates which move the growth from one quarter to the other one. But, pragmatically speaking, we don't see a substantial reduction in that category. And our innovation rate remains strong and we feel confident about our performance. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Coyne of BMO Capital Markets.","Shannon Coyne","Hi. Thanks. You talked last quarter about your bigger projects. And now that \u2013 and you just talked about having upside even without substantial innovation. I'm just wondering how that [indiscernible] markets and newness that the beauty consumer demands and what your thoughts are there?","Pierre Laubies","I think it's definitely a subject on which I am personally learning. I never realized the intensity of some of these categories in term of innovation, I would say, or newness. And you're right. This is one of the codes of the market and we'll adhere to the code and we may not have necessarily done that in the past.","I think when I was talking of the potential earlier, I was really more referring to the fact that we have in our assortment items which have higher velocity than others. We have places where we have more competitive edge than others. We have item which are well-positioned in prices and others which are not well positioned in prices. I think it is really what we are after, identify the product which are selling the fastest and we make more money and sell more of them. The bottle is simple in that one.","I think that it is easy in the beauty business to lose track of this very fundamentals because for the sheer complexity of the ranges. And also to a certain point of time, I would call it, the low level of barrier to entry to innovation and renovation, right? There are a lot of opportunities there to invent stuff. And the problem is not really to invent stuff, but to actually to be consistent, be clear about where are your key value item or your key SKUs and make sure they always deserve the right exposure or the right level of advertising. So, for me, we do see \u2013 for us, sorry, we do see a very substantial opportunity in being very precise in our assortment, pricing, subranges, and shelf performance.","Shannon Coyne","That's helpful. And then, I'm curious to know where you think you've lost the most ground in CoverGirl. It looks, to us, like you've actually gained ground recently in the younger demographic, but you're still losing in the older, the 35-plus consumer. I'm just curious if you're seeing the same thing. And then what do you think you need to do to turn that around and how fast do you think you can do that? Thanks.","Pierre Laubies","Yes. Yes. We do see the same thing. And I think we need to do several things. One, [indiscernible] probably need to turn on the TV again and which is what we are doing. Two, we also need to have advertising which sell hard versus advertising which hardly sells and which means that it is advertising which resonates with our consumers and advertising which capitalizes on our distinctive assets. And we have just conducted a distinctive asset research and the results are not surprising for us. And therefore, we are going to integrate these results into our advertising going forward.","We just did the same, for instance, with Clairol where we put back a very simple advertising and very effective advertising and immediately we got a sales uplift. So, these things require again consistency, persistency, rigor in understanding what works and what doesn't work and apply it systematically across all our brands, all our markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. You mentioned in the press release that the supply chain issues are largely fixed, which is tremendous. I'm wondering if you could just kind of review for us maybe kind of a checklist of what those issues are. Like, in the past, it was SAP Warehouse. What you've done to fix them? How you have confidence that they have been fixed? And then, kind of looking forward, how these improvements will manifest themselves in your business and to what extent, if any, you're in the penalty box with certain retailers and how long that may last? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Pierre-Andr\u00e9. Thanks for the question. Supply chain issues were of different nature, but the two bigger ones were in relation with, on the one hand \u2013 sorry, distribution centers, DCs, which were blocked and which [indiscernible] any more correctly. So, what we have done to \u2013 basically to make them work progressively better to find solutions to re-increase the capacity of these DCs and to click at the right level, solve the systems issue. And Germany, if I'm not mistaken, was solved already last quarter. We had still an issue with an US distribution center this quarter, but it's almost solved now and it's operating close to normal.","The second part of the issue was about the supply with two other suppliers not being able to supply us fragrance [ph] and some bottles for Luxury. This is being progressively resolved. So, the amount of shortage we have is getting lower and lower. And, in fact, that's the remaining part of the supply chain issues, but it's progressing every month. So, we now see very limited impact of the issues. So, that's for the part which we have sold and basically we don't expect that to come again.","I'll remind you that the reason why the supply chain issues arose is that we were in the process of an accelerated integration. The integration is now over. And not being on \u2013 not being existing anymore. Therefore, it doesn't have any risk to cause again supply chain issues. And, obviously, as you can imagine, the new management of supply chain is extremely careful with that.","I will complete this long response \u2013 answer, sorry, by telling that another impact from the supply chain issues has been some losses of customers. That particularly the case in Professional Beauty and losses of market share as a result. And it has been as well some delay in some launch and initiative.","This is not solved and will not be solved immediately. It will be solved over time. As we move into fiscal 2020, we are progressively \u2013 we believe we are progressing going to regain this customer, regain these market shares, and be able to launch the innovation we had planned to launch. But it will not have an immediate effect on the plan from this point in time. I think that's...","Robert Ottenstein","Can you give us\u2026?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Sorry.","Robert Ottenstein","What kind of magnitude of losses were there?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Total losses were $150 million in revenues and $100 million in profit, as I said during my presentation. You can expect that \u2013 so this is largely behind us and we'd probably recover the majority \u2013 more than the majority of it as soon as next year and then gradually it will increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","Yes, hi. Good morning. So, I guess, I wanted a little bit more color around the simplification strategy that you talked about. So, focusing on specific brands and scaling investment in those brands and focusing on countries, I guess, are you foreshadowing sort of more portfolio divestments or is it more just a question of reallocating advertising spending?","Pierre Laubies","No, we do not foresee portfolio divestment. We do foresee strengthening of the structure of our portfolio in the existing brand. So, we will reduce the number of sub-brands within the brand and we will make sure that, within each of these key sub-brands, the assortment that we have is the fastest rotating one as well as the highest gross margin one. So, that's the fundamentals of that.","And we do that by using, we call it, proprietary analytics which enables to leave no stone unturned across all the assortment of any given brand. And we are rolling this methodology out, as we speak today on our four top key markets. Very extensive work and intensive work, mobilizes a lot of energy, but at the same time, gives us a lot of insight and gives us a lot of insight for innovation going forward.","So, that's more needed [ph] from, I would call, it the effectiveness of our assortment. When it comes to brand, you're basically speaking to brand-country combination. We have about \u2013 55% of our business is growing 3.5% and 45% of our business is declining 10%. The 55% which is growing 3.5%, we aim at growing that faster by attributing it more advertising. And next year, we will concentrate probably behind this 55% of the business that we have which is growing probably 70% of our working media. ","And so, yes, some of the other market will decline, but it is very mission-critical that the growing and strong part of our portfolio grows faster. And for that, requires advertising at scale.","Faiza Alwy","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink of Jefferies.","Stephanie Wissink","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. The first is related to cost of goods. If you could just share with us your outlook for some of your costing initiatives, maybe across each of the division and then just remind us what percentage of your goods coming into the US are sourced out of China.","And if I could throw in a second question, just on the weakness in Younique, if you could help us diagnose maybe what's happening with that business and any strategies you have in place to start to see some improvement there? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","You'll take Younique or\u2026?","Pierre Laubies","I'll take Younique. Okay. So regarding Younique, the weakness is relatively simple. Younique, like all multi-level marketing businesses, go through a phase of classic hype and has gone through a phase of hype. Unfortunately, we are in the de-hype phase, if I can say so.","But, basically speaking, we do struggle to recruit presenters at Younique, and for couple of reasons. We do think that effectively \u2013 so there is probably an element of \u2013 to answer to the reduction of sales at Younique, we probably have over-complexified the portfolio and maybe there is an amount of fatigue of our presenters or complexity of the operation for presenters. So, we have an agenda of simplification there.","The second item is that we think that some algorithm changes at Facebook has probably not helped the performance of the Younique business. So, we are engaging into a dialog with Facebook specifically on this matter.","And three, possibly, we need to look at expanding into other digital media channel beyond Facebook to develop the business and we are exploring this opportunity. So, that's broadly speaking the action that are in place.","Also, and we have alluded to this conversation earlier when we are talking of the rhythm of innovation, and one of the key value item of Younique is mascara. And the rhythm of innovation of Younique hasn't been sufficient on mascara. This is a category which require high degree of innovation. And we just launched 4D Mascara, which is off to a very, very good start. So, we've silenced that again. Probably we didn't respect exactly the laws of beauty and we need to go back to that. And at the same time, the launch of our skincare range is off to reasonably good start too.","So, I think that expanding the business to relevant partition or following the laws of innovation of the industry are going to be mission-critical for Younique going forward. But we clearly monitor the situation very closely.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Okay. And on the COGS question, so several things. The first one is that obviously we continue having strong productivity from the supply chain. Somehow, you've seen the supply chain disruption, but the results of that is that we are generating productivity \u2013 strong productivity this year. And to some extent, you see that in the gross margin which is holding up pretty well despite a negative top line and that's one of the reasons due to the effort in COGS.","We'll continue next year. We believe we have significant potential to further improve the COGS. In fact, we believe we can step up the effort. We'll detail you that during the strat plan.","And one element of improvement will lie as well in the simplification. Simplification is going to be helpful from a top line standpoint and helpful because this is going to allow us focusing our media efforts on a fewer number of brands and, therefore, making them bigger, but it's also going to help on the COGS side because that's going to drive simplification and, therefore, reduce the COGS.","On the China point, specifically, we have an exposure which is in the \u2013 around $10 million, $20 million \u2013 around $50 million goods coming into the US from China. So, it's not a very high one, but we are monitoring the traffic, of course.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky","Hi, thanks. So, I was hoping to get back to Consumer Beauty and maybe if you could walk through the changes you're making in the business. In particular, if you could address the weakness you're seeing in retail hair care since that continues to be a drag. ","And then, along those same lines, it kind of sends some conflicting comments in regards to Consumer Beauty where you mentioned you're going to be reinvesting profits in the segment, but then you also mentioned you might be pulling advertising and working media away from the business. So, maybe if you can reconcile that.","And if you are truly calling media away from Consumer Beauty, do you think that just delays any sort of recovery? Thanks.","Pierre Laubies","Yeah. Over time, we will invest in media in Consumer Beauty. Again, like I said, this year, we need to manage a pragmatic fine line. So, we advertise as much as we can afford for the remainder of the year. But, again, we're already in May. So, the remainder of the year is not a lot of time. But next year, going forward, we will reinvest in media in Consumer Beauty substantially and we will fund that through a combination of focusing on our high profit item. Basically speaking, we will fund that through improving our gross margin essentially, right, and combination of strategic revenue management, combination of reducing non-working media, combination of reducing our COGS, combination of reducing office costs. So, broadly speaking, improve the gross margin and invest in working media at the expense of the other over-the-budget into the P&L of the company. So, that's very clear intention. And this working media will not only be reinvested, but they will be reinvested in a more focused manner. So, that's the fabric of our plan for fiscal year 2020. And I feel very confident that it will change our trajectory. It won't change the trajectory of the category. That is very clear. That's not our intent, but it will change the trajectory of our market shares in the category, and that's the plan.","When it comes to hair, it is a mission-critical category for us. We think that we have an opportunity here. And if you take that Clairol, for instance, it is the most underleveraged brand in the whole category when you rebalance its salience and its penetration. It is \u2013 versus its salience, it has a much lower penetration than it deserves. And mostly speaking, the reason why it has lower penetration than it deserves is because, actually, we're not necessarily focused on the right shade, our assortment is not the right one, or we are not necessarily using our distinctive assets on our packaging. So, we have a lot of, I would call it, 101 job to be done there and to improve our performance.","And when it comes to the category, yes, there are some categories which are not necessarily growing in hair, in retail, but there are categories which are growing and Root Touch-Up, for instance, is a very nice business performing very well. And I think it deserves a lot more innovation than we have given it the opportunity to \u2013 we have given it the opportunity so far. And we think that we have a real substantial opportunity to drive value and to drive penetration in that category.","Joe Lachky","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks. And good morning, everybody. I wanted to revisit the dividend decision optionality there. I guess I'm curious why do it given it's a relatively small amount of cash savings relative to almost $8 billion of debt. Is there anything we should read into a change in your views of free cash flow expectations going forward?","Pierre Laubies","Thanks for the question. Yeah, it does. The reading is that in the other of the topics we are taking, free cash was a very important one. The level of leverage was a very important one. And the dividend option is a construct which comes on top of very solid free cash flow. So, what we have seen \u2013 what I have seen for the past three months is that we have a lot of opportunities on free cash flow. And what I have seen is that these opportunities have started to materialize. And I believe we still have more opportunities and we have opportunities to generate more free cash flow and, therefore, to have more deleverage.","The dividend optionality is achieving two things at the same time. Number one, it provides some flexibility or it helps a bit the deleverage. And number two, it closes the topic of the dividend, which has been a topic until last quarter. And I thought that was very important to close it. So, it's a solution which I think is a clever one. It helps the deleverage and, at the same time, we can focus on the free cash flow, which is a real thing which is going to improve the debt of the company.","So, that's the sense and the reason why we've done that. And I think that's a pretty good solution and a pretty sustainable solution, by the way. And by the way, it has as well helped us to clarify where we want to go in terms of leverage and to affirm the four times net debt to EBITDA medium-term objective. And now, we have, therefore, a very clear target for the medium term and a very clear direction.","I just want to add to this comment or to somehow hijack your question to say something, which is that what we are doing with Pierre and with the team is to try and take things one by one and in the order. We are not here to solve everything at once because we think this is not possible. We are here to take the topics and address them one by one, so that we have sustainable value creation and performance in the company.","So, the first thing we've done has been to address the supply chain issues and to stabilize the company from that standpoint, and we've done that. The second thing has been the free cash flow. The third has been the operating income. It's very important that we stabilize the operating income of this company and we stabilize the margins.","At the same time, we are assessing what we need to do in terms of top line because the worst thing we could do would be to immediately start shooting everywhere, to waste money behind things which are improper, instead of doing what we do, which is to review the portfolio and to understand really where we need to put the money.","And this is exactly what we are doing at the moment. As soon as we are ready, I can tell you that our objective will be to reaccelerate the top line. Simply we cannot do everything at the same time.","So, when you look at the results, my take is that we are absolutely delivering what we want to deliver. We are delivering on OI, we are delivering on cash flow, we are closing the topic of the dividend, and we are getting prepared for the top line. And everything we see so far makes us confident that we have opportunities and that we'll be able to re-accelerate that as soon as 2020.","So, yeah, sorry to have hijacked your question, but I thought that it was very important to make this point because this is really the spirit of the company, the spirit of the management, and the way we are taking the things.","Thank you. We have time for one more question.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of J.P. Morgan","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you for squeezing me in. And good morning. So, on the dividend payment in stock, I understand, obviously, it's going to help you unlock part of the use of cash, but there's also a negative impact on the share count dilution. And you talk on the slides that you expect a moderate impact. But should we assume you not be able as Coty to buy back the shares to neutralize it? ","And then the second question is in the growth of ALMEA. What is the growth ex-Brazil because, as you pointed out last year, you had a negative impact from the price increase? And if you're looking, in fact, in your guidance for operating income for this year, if you are assuming or if you are taking pricing in Brazil as we speak so to neutralize that? Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","Yeah. So, the only thing about Brazil I can say is that Brazil represents approx. 5% of sales and it doubled in the third quarter because their base was very low last year. And, therefore, its rate of increase was 100%. It's, obviously, a one-off, i.e. it's a lot about the base of last year more than the performance of this year, but it's a business which is growing in a pretty healthy way.","On the dilution, so if you make the math now, you take the number of shares held by JAB divided by two, it's a dilution of about 2 million shares per quarter. It's about 1% to 1.2%. So, that's a dilution. It's a modest one, but that's a dilution. We just consider that it's something \u2013 1% dilution is nothing if you compare to our hopes and targets of EPS accretion through the various things we are doing.","So, the fact we have closed the topic of the dividend, the fact to have the cash flow, to put the topic of the leverage and covenants aside and to be able to focus on the business and create value is going to create far more EPS rather than to try and optimize the scheme through different layers. That's our position.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","I think we're done. We both want to thank you for your attendance and your support. And we'll be happy to come back to you as soon as the end of June, so not waiting for Q4, but the end of June to tell us what we want to do over the medium term. Thank you and see you on the road probably.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 3. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, please go ahead.","Kevin Monaco - Treasurer, Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Bart Becht, Chairman and Interim CEO; and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to take a moment to discuss the format of this morning's call. For the first 30 minutes, we will provide a short overview of the quarter and year-to-date financial results, and we will open the call for some questions on these financial results. We will then spend the next 60 minutes to provide an in depth update on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction, followed by questions and answers only on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction.","Please reserve all questions on the merger transaction and the long-term financial outlook for the Q&A, following the transaction update.

This morning, we'll provide you with a brief overview of Q3 and year-to-date results, as well as a detailed update on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction.","Our efforts to create a healthy platform for Coty to become a strong global leader and challenger in beauty remains on track. Q3 revenues, which declined minus 1% on a like-for-like basis, were consistent with our expectations for muted like-for-like trends through the end of the fiscal year as we gradually rationalize non-strategic product lines and businesses.","Power Brands on the other hand continue to outperform the overall business, both for the quarter and year-to-date. While Q3 adjusted operating profit was down due to one-off items, including the negative impact on the Brazilian Beauty Business as a result of the change in commercial terms to conform with Coty standards. Our year-to-date adjusted operating profit was flat with solid 7% growth at constant currency.","For the full fiscal 2016, we continue to expect like-for-like revenue performance relatively consistent with the year-to-date trends. We anticipate high-single digit growth in adjusted operating income at constant rates for the full year, offset by negative FX impact with the adjusted operating income in-line with the prior year at actual rates.","These results and outlook are consistent with our strategy to build a healthier and better business despite subdued revenue growth. In summary, we believe we are well on track to build a healthy platform for Coty to become a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry, and provide the right basis to drive profitable growth and deliver shareholder value over time.","I will now hand over the call to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bart, and good morning, everyone. Total Q3 net revenues declined 1% like-for-like with an improvement in the Fragrance segment's revenue trends, compared to the first half, and moderate Color Cosmetics segment growth in-spite of the decline in the U.S. retained end markets. Fiscal year-to-date, the adjusted gross margin increased a very strong 110 basis points to 61.2%, reflecting our continuous efforts in driving supply-chain efficiencies. We keep on building a better business even in the face of soft top-line trends with stable adjusted operating income fiscal year-to-date with a stronger 7% increase at constant currency. The year-to-date adjusted operating margin grew 40 basis points. Our year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08, compared to $0.91 in the prior year, in part reflecting the benefit from a favorable tax settlement of $113.3 million this year, compared to a $32.5 million settlement in the prior year period.","Turning to the capital structure, we took the opportunity to raise an incremental \u20ac465 million in term loans and use the proceeds to partially repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility that were drawn to fund the acquisition of the Brazilian Beauty Business. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation allowed us to continue to advance on our strategic and financial objectives. Fiscal year-to-date, we generated $445.3 million in operating cash flow and $330 million in free cash flow, with free cash flow up over $100 million versus the prior year. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any share and expect to remain opportunistic with our existing $500 million share repurchase authorization. This concludes our discussion of our Q3 and fiscal year-to-date results.","Bart and I will now take couple of questions on the results, after which we will provide you with a comprehensive update on the P&G Beauty Brands transaction.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, looking at the top-line in the quarter, the Americas result was pretty weak, at down 8%. But the international results generally looked pretty strong across the board. So I was just hoping you could give us some detail on if that international strength can continue going forward? And also any issues in America you think cause results to get better going forward?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say both the European as well as the emerging market business basically has done a bit better, basically in the quarter which is encouraging. Like you said the U.S. remains for the time being the soft spot, clearly in part driven by the fact that last year, we had a very successful basically you know innovation, which was called Sally Hansen Miracle Gel, which we're now lapping, so which clearly is part basically of the softness. So we're looking forward basically to correct that at some point in time but I would say, you put your finger on it is the U.S., basically is the area where we still have room for improvement.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then in terms of A&P, can you give us an update on what you're spending levels were year-over-year in the quarter? And as you look going forward, obviously you're generating very significant cost savings. Are you assuming that more of that gets reinvested back behind the business to drive the top-line acceleration? And how should we think about spending back behind the business as you look out over the next couple of years on the heritage Coty business?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We have continued to focus on reducing our non-strategic spend within the advertising and consumer promotional budget. We've seen substantial increases in media delivery this year, which still needs to turn \u2013 basically into substantial increase in revenue growth, but we have seen basically shift. So, I would say there is not a need basically is to start spending back the increased profit back into the business, because let's call it the working media and the strategic spend behind the business has substantially increased already over the last nine months and we will continue on this trend going forward. So, we are seeing a reallocation from non-strategic into strategic spend, overall spend levels are more than competitive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephanie Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Patrice, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments that the U.S. Color business was down. I believe you said the Color business overall was down. If you could just talk a little bit about the market for nail care, and more broadly, across Color, that would be very helpful. Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Well, the nail care market is down at the moment and clearly, we are market leader in the nail care category overall globally as well as in the U.S. So that really has impacted the business no question about that. So it's not so much a share issue, it's much more lapsing of the key innovation which drove market growth last year. So we are getting ready basically for future innovations, clearly, in order to drive the growth in the market. So that is probably the number one driver basically of the U.S. for the time being.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys, good morning. I'm just trying to figure out how much of the stuff this quarter was kind of a kitchen sink cleanup. So can you just talk about the Hypermarcas sales number? Because it was like $30 million below our estimate. And then the true-up on incentive comp \u2013 are you guys all caught up to the year? So that would be like an absence of the negative in the next quarter? And then I have an unrelated follow-up, if I can.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Sorry, can you repeat the last part.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just the true-up on the incentive comp? Is it trued up this quarter? So will it be an absence of a negative in the fourth quarter?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","All right, I will deal with the first question. So on Hypermarcas, there was a change in commercial policy following the acquisition. Just to give you some perspective, Hypermarcas has very long basically payment terms for its customers. In addition provided substantial discounts at month-end and quarter-end in order to make the numbers. We have corrected for that and put the customers much more on a Coty type policy. So what does that mean? That clearly means that the payment days or the receivable days for customers are coming down substantially, and also basically the month and quarter end discounts have been largely eliminated. The result of that is a substantial reduction of trade inventories in Brazil.","They were well over 100 days in the trade and they've been practically cut in half. So, clearly that has an impact on the revenues. Just to reassure you, the consumption growth in Brazil remains very good. It remains ahead of the market, it remains basically in the double-digit range. So, it is not an issue basically of sell-out. It's a temporary issue of sell-in because of the adjustment of commercial terms. I think you should expect that as basically we go forward, this gradually basically goes back to a normal level. We've said this business was roughly $250 million in size with a margin accretive performance and we are sticking with that. There's really nothing basically on an underlying basis which creates any concerns. I will now basically hand over to Patrice, who can answer the comp question.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So Bill on the stock comp question, this is really due to prior features for certain executive that have left the business. So that's really what it is. So this is nothing to do with the true up of this quarter.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then I'd just like a follow-up. You don't really talk about your digital and e-commerce strategies. And I know you bought that small media company in New York, digital media company. So how much re-investment do you have to do in that business? And how far behind \u2013 if you guys think you are behind? Do you think you are, and how long will it take to kind of bridge that gap?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, there's a substantial increase in digital media happening as we speak and I would say, we are going to see another step change basically next year. I don't think we are that far behind to be honest with you and with the general consumer goods industry. I think everybody around the industry is basically getting adjusted to the fact that consumers increasingly consume digital media rather than television or print media. It clearly differs very much by market. For instance clearly, if you take the established markets like U.S., UK and some other European countries, you see very high consumption clearly if you go through emerging markets, you see much less consumption. So, there is a substantial increase in digital happening as we speak. So, I would say the gap is going to be closed in the next 12 months to 18 months.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about operating margin by product segment? Clearly a very big divergence in terms of the trend line across Fragrance, Cosmetics and Skin Care. But particularly on Fragrance, can you talk about the run rate that you expect going forward, given the big increase in A&P this quarter?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, yeah, I really would encourage you not to look at quarterly results basically on categories for a very simple reason is you're going to see substantial swing simply because of the initiatives which are launched in the market. So, you're going to see certain A&P phasing happening there. You need to really look at category profitability on an annual basis not on a quarterly basis. Otherwise, every quarter we'll have a discussion, because a certain initiative gets launched that the operating margin comes down.","And clearly in this quarter, there was a substantial investment behind CK2 happening on Calvin Klein which clearly is depressing the operating margin. So, I really think you need to take a look at it on an annual basis. You know the Fragrance business, as you've seen historically, has been a very profitable business for Coty, and it will remain a profitable business going forward.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then maybe if I could follow up on Color, is there a big difference in terms of margins between Color Cosmetics versus \u2013 like, face cosmetics versus nail care?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No. Not really.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","No.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Gere with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thanks. Just two quick questions. One, just wanted to go back to the nail category. I was wondering if you can talk maybe a little bit about the different channels out there? Because I know the specialty channel is kind of making some higher investments in this category. So I was just wondering if you could talk maybe divergence of sales by this versus other retail or salon? That's the first question.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, we have \u2013 clearly, we've two very different nail businesses and they overlap in one channel, which is called Ulta, so where you'll see both brands. So, clearly, OPI is predominantly a salon business but you do see it show up in Ulta, which is definitely is a client which is developing very fast. Sally Hansen, clearly, is a mass market brand, but also shows up in Ulta. So there are basically certain channels where there is overlap. I'm not sure I answered your question but that channel is \u2013 clearly is developing relatively fast.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I guess what I was trying to figure out is that if you saw more of a slowdown in maybe some more of the mass channels versus specialty, versus maybe the last quarter or the last two quarters? I'm just trying to see within \u2013 I know the whole category obviously is lapping against Miracle Gel. But I was just kind of \u2013 just in general, I just wanted to see if you're seeing continued faster growth in specialty, where there's a lot more investment behind the category, as opposed to mass, where it doesn't feel as much. So I was just wondering if you could just maybe expound a little bit more on just the differentiation. That's what I meant. Sorry for the confusion.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No, I would not \u2013 no, I would say the development of the nail category is pretty much basically across the board. Now having said that within that certain channels basically performed better than others. So I highlighted one, clearly which is Ulta, but other than that, there is we are simply lapsing a very successful period for the category and for Sally Hansen behind Miracle Gel.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. You guys have been pretty adamant in terms of talking about really improving structurally the long-term margins in the industry. And when you talk about the stuff that is going on in hypermarkets, et cetera, that you're looking to fix, you can see how there is opportunity there. But I guess it also highlights that the industry has a lot of bad margin practices that are going on there. How do you guys get your margins up? I mean, do you worry about what the industry does in response, in terms of sort of potentially going to the lowest common denominator? Do you need the industry to move with you, or can you move independently here? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, no, I really don't believe that the industry needs to move with us. And the reason why I'm saying that is because I believe that our investment levels are very much competitive with the industry. So that means that the margin improvement that we are realizing is independent from the investment levels that we have in the business. And, therefore, there is a possibility to structurally improve Coty's margins ahead of the industry.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question","Kevin Monaco - Treasurer, Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","I think, we'll take one more question and then we shift over to the next presentation, so...","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. One quick one, and then a larger one. On stock repurchase, a little bit surprised that there wasn't any this quarter, given the announcement last quarter. And can you talk about the board's willingness to repurchase stock here before the Procter transaction? And then the second question, just going back to the advertising and promotion boost that you guys have made, I'm just a little bit surprised that we haven't seen a better response on the top-line, I guess. Is it more consumers not responding to the increased media spending, or does it just take some time to flow through? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So on your first question, so what we said is that we wanted to remain opportunistic, and so the board gave us an authorization to repurchase up to $500 million, but we will remain very opportunistic. So I have no other comment to make at this stage.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, in investment in A&P, we've seen very good response in some pockets, on some brands in some geographies and not so good in others. And so you're absolutely right. So, for instance, Rimmel has done very well, Marc Jacobs has done very well, Sally Hansen outside of the U.S. has done very well, Miu Miu has responded very, very well. At the same time, we've also seen on some other brands like Calvin Klein where the response has been much more muted. So it is not a simple picture as it doesn't work at all or it works completely. It is very much in pockets. You also have seen that Europe and the emerging markets are doing better than North America, so also by geography it has differed quite a bit. So, but you're absolutely right that we are focusing harder and harder on return on investment in A&P to make sure that we're getting a better top-line reaction.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So I suggest we stop at there and that we move to the presentation on the impact of the P&G merger, because I'm sure you will have quite a few questions on the subjects and I want to make sure that you \u2013 that we answer your questions.","If there's any further questions on the quarter, we'd be more than happy to take those after the call is over.","Presentation","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So in terms of the update on the transaction, we are really going to cover three subjects; first, we are going to confirm the strategic rationale of the transaction. We're going to provide an update on the transaction and the progress we have made around this on a year-to-date basis, and finally we're going to provide an update on the financial benefits of the merger with the P&G Specialty business.","So, next page please. So, first, before I give the strategic rationale one more time, let me first highlight you know what Coty's ambition is in beauty, is to really to transform Coty over time into a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry, clearly with \u2013 or for the ultimate benefit of shareholders.","Now, in that respect, the P&G merger, clearly, is a very good step in that direction. We are creating with the merger a $9 billion leader and challenger in beauty, becoming the number three after L'Or\u00e9al and Est\u00e9e Lauder in the industry. Not only do we create a much more of a skill player in beauty, we're also creating the worldwide number one in Fragrance.","Can I have the next slide please? As you can see basically from the slide, which is now on the screen. So you can see that we are becoming well ahead basically of L'Or\u00e9al in terms of market position. In terms of Color Cosmetics, we are becoming the number three overall most likely the number two basically mass Color Cosmetics with a number of very good brands as we'll show you in a minute.","Finally, we are adding the worldwide number two in hair salon. Clearly this is a new category you know for Coty. In terms of the portfolio, we are getting a very nicely balanced portfolio. In terms of between categories as well as distribution channels, so just to take you very quickly through that. Coty Consumer Beauty will be 41% of the total business, would roughly $3.8 billion, very much focused on the mass channel and on three categories which are Color Cosmetics, Hair Retailing which is Hair Coloring and Styling as well as Body Care.","Coty Luxury very much focused on the prestige channel and focused on Fragrance and Skin. And Coty Professional very much focused on the salon channel focused on hair as well as nail care. So a very balanced portfolio, both in terms of categories and distribution channels, and most importantly with the very strong portfolio of brands.","You can see Coty Luxury, there you'll have the top three brands will be Calvin Klein, Gucci and Hugo Boss. And Consumer Beauty the size of the brands is more evenly balanced. You see some very strong brands like CoverGirl, Rimmel, Max Factor, Sally Hansen et cetera. And then ultimately, in Coty Professional Beauty, you see two main brands which are anchoring the business, which are Wella and OPI. Not only do we get a very strong portfolio, we're also increasing the critical mass across basically our top markets and importantly, we're increasing critical mass in several of the emerging markets. So, Brazil, clearly that's a very big increase and you know, but that was off a very small base in Brazil. So clearly this number doesn't even include Hypermarcas, Brazil will become a very big market for Coty.","Russia was a decent sized market becomes a much bigger business for us. China also becomes a much bigger business for us. So not only are we getting a substantial increase in scale in the established markets, but we also increased the scale in a number of the emerging markets. So, overall that gives us a very nice basically portfolio with strong brands and skill benefits in our geographies.","If you can, please some previous slide, please. Thank you. So it also provides a very good opportunity to accelerate growth and improve profits and cash flow. So from a growth point of view, we will have going forward, a divisional structure. Why is that important? Because the divisional structure is a much focused structure than what we have in today. So as I already showed you, it will focus very much on the single distribution channel and only two to three categories per division. And with that we hope that we're going to get not just increased focus, we get increased competence and we get a much more competitive basically capability in place in order to compete in the market.","We also are going to substantially further increase our focus on sell-outs by an increased digital customer engagement, improving the in-store excellence, and to drive high levels of product innovation. Another topic which we still have to come to and which will further detail post in the next couple of months is the rationalization of the portfolio and the wholesale business. Why is that important, is because we still need to tighten down the focus on fewer brands and fewer doors in order to drive a higher growth and a better quality business. And finally, clearly from a growth point of view, we will be looking in due time to further acquisitions, Patrice will highlight this a little bit later, but clearly our pro forma financial profile will very much allow us to participate in further acquisition opportunities.","In a minute, we'll come to profit and cash flow, but clearly we're anticipating material earnings per share accretion due to synergies. And we also expect substantial incremental cash flow due to both higher profits as well as net working capital benefits. Finally, we'll very much from an incentive system make sure that the management is very much driving in combination of top-line growth, margin expansion and cash flow generation. And we'll do that both through the combination of short-term bonus structure as well as long-term incentives in order to make sure that we're getting a balance basically focus behind those three basically key leaders.","So that gives you a quick snapshot of the strategic rational basically for the business, as you can see from the slides I just presented. This is very similar to what we discussed in July. And so, we are very much confirming the strategic rational of the merger with the P&G business. I'm now going to hand over to Patrice, who is going to take you through the transaction update, the progress we've made, as well as the financial benefits of the transactions.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bart. So couple of point s on the slide 13, the transaction summary. So first on the structure, very much of the same. So transaction proposal was valued at $12.5 billion, comprised of $9.6 billion of equity and $2.9 billion of debt. We have a collar mechanism of plus or minus $1 billion, based on the trading price of Coty stock with a range of $22.06 to $27.06 with a middle range of $24.56. Based on the latest share price and we've assumed here the price on April 13, which was for the S-4 filing of $29.81, Coty estimates the issuance of 412 million shares and $2 billion of assumed debt. The split between the P&G and the Coty shareholders would be 54%\/46%.","So now few words on the mechanics of the transaction. The preferred option from the P&G side is to do a split-off. In a split-off, P&G offers its shareholders the option to exchange their shares of P&G common stock for shares of the new Coty. For the offer to be fully subscribed, 6% of the P&G shares need to be tendered, only 6% of them. In terms of timing, it's fair to say that the transaction is expecting to close in the course of the month of October 2016.","Now next slide 14, the update on the progress that we have made. So as you have seen, all of you, so we have filed the S-4 on April 22. We had the unconditional anti-trust clearance for the E.U. and the U.S. and we have confirmed the transfer of 10 Fragrance licenses.","Operationally as Bart said, we have now an organization structure, we have designed an organizational structure with all the associated headcounts and the decision regarding the location has been mainly made. In terms of staffing, the Executive Committee and the management team of the division has been appointed, and we are now going to the next layer. In terms of deal economics, I will come back to that on a few slides, but we've done most of the work.","In terms of portfolio and wholesale rationalization, it's fair to say that the work is still very much in progress. But what we can say at this stage is that on the portfolio rationalization in terms of discontinuation and divestments, we'd have some discontinuation and divestment in the range of 6% to 8% of the combined new portfolio. So I'm sure you're going to have a lot of question on the impact on the deal economics, is it EPS neutral? Yes or no, etc, etc. We're not ready to answer any of this question yet. We just want to signal to the market what we have in mind for the time being, but still work in progress.","In terms of go-to-market change, we are assessing some of these, especially in emerging markets and of course, there is an extensive preparation in terms of processes, in terms of systems, in terms of infrastructure. There is 200 people full-time within Coty working on that with a lot of help from experts that has done this type of transaction in the past. So we are very much in motion.","In terms of financing, so as you all know Coty entered into a secure financing commitment of $4.5 billion. We have used the opportunity to upside this to $5 billion in last month actually in April 2016. Galleria, is fully-owned by P&G, entered into secured financing commitments of the same amount $4.5 billion expected to be ultimately assumed by Coty upon the close.","Now back to Bart, on the management team.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think you've seen that we have put in place a very strong management team not just at the executive committee level, which we see basically on the screen at the moment. The executive committee team has very extensive experience in consumer goods across the board and in addition to that where relevant, they also have basically very extensive beauty experience. It is an increasingly diverse group also below this team, we have made many appointments already. So, we've made practically all the appointments at the level below this group. And we are well advanced in terms of making appointments at the levels below that.","And you will see that across the board, we have made very good appointments, some of them which have been announced externally as you've seen basically with Shannon Curtin basically last week in the United States. So we have made a raft of new appointments. They are not all basically from P&G and Coty, some of them are from external. So the mix has changed and is changing as we speak, but overall very good team.","Back to you, Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bart. So now on the financial update. So on the slide 17, so certain statements in this presentation are forward-looking statement. So I'm not going to go through. Kevin already alluded to that at the start of the call. The only point I'd like to emphasize is the bottom of the page where this acquisition of the P&G Beauty Brands is a complex carve out transaction and as a result of that the integration efforts might for certain period of time detract as from improving the performance of the underlying business.","So these being said, the next four slides are, I' m sure slides that most of you are expecting. So we're going to spend a bit of time on that going through these slides.","So on the slide number 18, on the synergies. So all these four slides are really a refresh of the July presentation. So you will see that in the format, we did roughly the same to make sure that you had a comparable basis. So first of the synergies, so we'll start from the fiscal 2015, adjusted carve-out EBITDA coming from P&G, which include already $380 million of synergy that we materialize day one. Then we have the impact of two of the license that are not coming with the transactions, so Dolce & Gabbana and Christina Aguilera. So we've taken $130 million, which is the brand contribution. So what is the brand contribution? The brand contribution is the gross margin deducted from all the investment in advertising in consumer promotion to support and to nurture the brand.","Then you have the synergies of $400 million, which is an update versus the July presentation. So let me spend a little bit of time on this $400 million. So first point, our ongoing position has been to build an organization by division focusing on each of the segments. Two, how did we do that? We did that with a bottom-up approach by function and by country. So very in-depth work. And then we have costs, this targeted organization in each of this countries, in either country. Challenge against benchmark based targets.","So, this is where we landed now with this targeted organization that has been costed. And when you compare the Coty organization plus the P&G organization minus the targeted organization, you come at with the $780 million synergies. So this $780 million synergies represent 16% of the acquired revenues. And they are very much going to be a phase with 40% materializing in year one, 70% after year two, and 80% after year three, and then the full synergies after year four.","In order to be able to realize these synergies, we're going to incur $1.2 billion of cost. So, let me spend a little bit of time on these costs. So first 90% of them are cash cost and out of this $1.2 billion, you have 25% that is really related to the specifics of this transaction, which is a combination of the carve-out under an RMT umbrella. So, this is roughly $320 million that is related to that. So let me give you a couple of example on these costs. So first you have the TSA cost. Second P&G is a highly integrated business with a big GBS shared service center. And so we have to disentangle the P&G Beauty with the rest of the P&G business, which is increasing complexity and as a result of that, associated cost.","Third point, the RMT required the business of P&G to be carve-out and then integrated. What does that mean? This means that we need to set up interim P&G entities and processes that then, after the exit of the TSA needs to un-wided and integrating into the Coty processes. And of course, we need to train people to be able to do so.","Now fourth, most of the carve-out aim at either increasing the scope like adding new categories for instance or increasing the scale. Actually, we're doing both, which increasing the complexity and then the cost associated to that. So that's roughly what is leading to 25% of the cost, which is the $320 million, which is for us due to this very unusual transaction.","Second part of this $1.2 billion, you have roughly $135 million that is due to go-to-market Galleria changes that will happen later on. This is very much work in progress, but we're going to reset up some of the go-to-market from Galleria. The last part $745 million is directly related to the synergies. So we are generating $780 million synergies with the one-off directly attributed with synergy with $745 million. And I think this is really the way you should look at it. So we're building on the bottom-up basis an organization which is extremely focused, divisionalized, focusing on the expertise in the respective segments, but a very lean organization. So now what does that mean in terms of operating margin?","So first, all these slides do not include Hypermarcas. So same start as what you have seen in July but of course updated. So what you can see is that you start in slide 19 from the standalone Coty, which is 12% plus operating margin. We added the carve-out business from P&G, which added 200 basis points, so we would result in 14% operating margin without touching the business. Then you deduct which is an impact of 40 basis point, the impact of D&G and Christina Aguilera, and then with all the synergies, we have 430 basis points. So this means that we are going to add 600 basis points to the Coty's standalone business in operating profit margin over a four-year period making Coty clearly an industry leader at 18% operating margin.","Okay. Our top peers are in the range of 15 to 17 operating margin percentage. So, really with this transaction, we immediately focusing ourselves to an 18% pro forma operating margin and this doesn't include Hypermarcas as I said.","So now, next slide, what does that mean from an EPS standpoint? So, first, this slide exclude the purchase price accounting related to the amortization. And we are currently revisiting the metrics with which we should measure the underlying performance of the business, and in doing so, what we pay attention to is that it needs to be similar to the way we measure the business on a near-historical basis. And it also needs to be comparable to our peers. And that's the reason why we are currently assessing and evaluating the option to exclude the purchase price accounting-related amortization.","So, when you go through this slide, you start with the Coty fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS, which is $0.99. Then you have the dilution based on the issuing of shares, which is the same number as what we quoted in July, then you have the contribution of the P&G carve-out business, which is $0.83 that leads to $1.20 to $1.25. Then you deduct the D&G and the Christina Aguilera brand contribution, which is $0.11. And then you add all the synergies that will generate, which is $0.39. What does this mean? This means that we will increase by 50% the EPS versus the current standalone Coty business. And I really think this is the way you should look at it.","We have a current standalone Coty business, which is in the range of $1 of EPS and now would be more in the range of $1.50 after this transaction on a pro forma basis. And this is, of course, after we implement all the synergies, so after year four.","So, now in term of cash, cash is king. So slide 21, so in terms of working capital, so immediately at closing, we will more than double the cash generation of Coty standalone to generate on a free cash flow basis between $800 million and $900 million without further reduction of the working capital. Then you add some analysis that we have made on the working capital. And so we are refreshing this analysis by increasing the working capital synergies from $200 million to $500 million, so half a billion dollars over four years.","The bulk of that would be realized by the end of fiscal 2018. So actually you have two effect on that, the first one is that you have a one-off half a billion dollar cash generation, and the second one is that by doing that, we'll be very close to zero working capital, which means that your cash conversion ratio is optimal. So your earnings are converting into cash immediately.","Now in terms of CapEx, so we're increasing by $100 million the CapEx versus our July assumption, which is mainly you have three main legs into this CapEx of $500 million. You have real estate because we need to stand up some organization and co-locate the division in most of the markets. So that's point one. Point two evidently like in all the transactions, you have a lot of IT infrastructure that we need to build and step up. And it's fair to say that all the work that we have done in the last two years is now producing some really good results and is allowing us to avoid come CapEx that we'll have to add, provided we didn't do anything in the last two years. And of course you have then the supply-chain CapEx to be able to stand up a couple of factories.","So 90% of this one-time CapEx will be incurred through fiscal 2018. And then we'll come back to a much more normal ratio of CapEx, which you could estimate being 4% of top-line. Now on the capital structure, we are slightly increasing the pro forma leverage to 3.2 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. Why is that? Because we're reflecting the aftermarket acquisition and the share buyback program that we have executed between the months of July and the month of December fiscal 2015.","We are going as we said to increase the dividend per share to $0.50 post-closing. And so it's clear to me and it's clear to all of us that we are going to have a combined business with a lot of strategic and functional flexibility with a very lean cost structure and with a very moderate pro forma leverage of 3.2 times which once again, as Bart said, give us ample ammunition to further participate in the consolidation of this industry.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Excellent.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So now, I will leave the floor to Bart for the wrap-up.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So yeah, in summary, the merger creates a very good pure-play new global leader and challenger in beauty, with $9.2 billion in net revenues. You've seen basically the substantial increase in pro forma EPS of roughly $0.50, off more or less a dollar where it sits today, so a very substantial increase. It is targeted to generate substantial pro forma free cash flow of about $800 million to $900 million providing ample flexibility for the future. Post rationalization of Coty's portfolio and wholesale business, which we are working on, the merger creates a clear opportunity to accelerate growth both organically and via future M&A and that is very much because we are going to create a different structure for the company, a much more focused structure with a more focused portfolio with better staffing behind that and with ample, basically, you know, support levels behind that.","We have appointed already a very strong new management team, which is being well-aligned to drive shareholder value. So, overall, I think you know, I can confirm today that the strategic rationale for the transaction remains. We've made excellent progress basically from an integration point of view year-to-date. We should be well-positioned to absorb this business and you've seen Patrice take you through the financials, which are substantially better than where they were \u2013 when we announced the transaction.","So, with that said, I suggest we take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Your line is open.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, Good morning. Thank you. Two questions, first is with regard to sort of your updated look at the business. Can you comment on the trends that we've been watching in the Procter business, the brand you are acquiring? Have those basically been as expected or worse than you would have expected a year ago when you announced the transaction?","And then second thing. Just looking back at the quarter you just printed, your comment that the core business may suffer little bit of disruption. Just broadly speaking, it feels as if kind of the cost to compete in the makeup cosmetics industry has gone up, we are just seeing slower growth in the industry, slower growth from you, slower growth from Est\u00e9e and yet a continued high level of investment. And my question is, does that concern you? Do you think differently, I mean the cost savings outlook for the Procter acquisition looks fantastic, but do you think today that you might have to invest more to achieve the same level of growth that you had hoped to achieve just given the competitive dynamics in the industry? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, in terms of the trends, the trends have not changed dramatically since we bought the business. So, clearly within the business, you've seen the S-4 filing. So you have the numbers, the business is declining 2%. So, clearly if you ask me am I excited about this? Clearly, the answer is no. Within that business, though, there are certain parts which are doing very well. For instance the salon business is performing very nicely. The Fragrance business is doing better than it has done historically. On the other side, basically we do have some concerns about Color Cosmetics and substantial concerns about the hair coloring and styling at the retail level. So it is not a uniform picture on the P&G business and if you ask me am I excited about the business trend, the answer is no. There is still a lot of work that needs to be done in order to address that.","In terms of the investment levels basically which are required in this business, it is definitely a challenging business in particular because the whole industry to some extent is fragmenting in terms in pockets both from a channel and a brand point of view. And clearly, you know that requires basically stronger activity in order to maintain growth momentum. Will that eventually mean that we need to invest more? I'm not sure because we have quite substantial investment levels on the business already. I think what is more required is that we have a tighter more focused business in order to compete and we'll be coming back to this when we talk about the rationalization of both basically the portfolio and the number of doors in which we compete.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just following-up on that. When you were talking about the Coty quarter. Does this apply to the broader business? You said at the very end, I think, in the Q&A that some of your reinvestment wasn't having the payback that you had expected it to when you were working to improve on sort of the return on your investment spending, but given the vastly more complex organization, how do you go about improving that? Is that a systems process? Is that a people's process? How do you make sure that the money that you're reinvesting actually pays off?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say very good point from a return on investment point of view. There is more work that needs to be done within Coty. We need to become much more of a sell-out focused organization. Parts of the company doing a good job, other parts of the company are not. It is something which we are actively you know working on and addressing, but we are not there. Like I said before we have certain brands \u2013 brand country combinations which are doing extremely well. So if you look at Rimmel overall is doing very well. Sally Hansen outside of the U.S. is doing very well, Marc Jacobs is doing very well. Miu Miu has done very well, but we also have other pockets where we are not getting the return on investment. So there is certainly room for improvement and it's not just a question of systems, it's a question of training of people.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. You made a point of mentioning throughout that Hypermarcas was not included in these numbers, so if you could talk a little bit about the degree to which incremental CapEx on that business or any kind of incremental spending, how that would impact this forward look? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah Lauren, so thanks for the question. So in terms of incremental CapEx for Hypermarcas, this is going to be extremely marginal. So in the big scheme of things given the picture we are looking at, I don't think that's going to be very much at all. So that's what we see. You know we intentionally decided in this presentation to exclude Hypermarcas to make things more comprehensive and more readable rather than mixing different acquisition etc. So we'll come back there on, but honestly in big scheme of things Hypermarcas is not very much at all.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And same goes, Patrice, with the \u2013 just in terms of incremental spending to hire people in Brazil and so on, because my understanding is you're getting almost no infrastructure with Procter in Brazil?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, but that's really the \u2013 this is one of the benefits of the transaction with Hypermarcas is that it's going to smooth, it's going to be an enabler for the transaction because actually what we are acquiring there is the go-to-market state-of-the-art factory and warehouse. So, we are getting that via the Hypermarcas acquisition. So I expect some limited impact from that some point.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then the phasing of synergies that you share on slide 18, just to be clear that they \u2013 does that refer to the $400 million incremental or the total basket?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","No. No, that refers to the total. So, the $780 million synergies are going to be phased with 40% in year one, which is all the $380 million at the time of closing, 70% year two, 80% year three and 100% a year four. So, that's because the total of the $780 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to the operating margin expectation, the 18% that you talked about, how much implied reinvestment is in there, is there any step-up relative to current levels? And you were talking about, Bart, not anticipating any sort of meaningful reinvestment, but may be you could give us a bit of color in terms of what is actually baked into that numbers as a percentage of sales or just broadly if you don't feel comfortable giving a specific target?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so thanks for the question. So, actually in this exercise the way we did it is really to take the pro forma of Coty, to take the pro forma of P&G, and then to deduct the two brands that are not coming in terms of brand contribution and to add the synergies. We didn't change anything in terms of underlying business, in terms of assumption, in terms of operating model. So, it's really just by adding the synergies and adding the P&G business mechanically the operating margin is at 18% and that's the reason why I mentioned it doesn't include Hypermarcas, it doesn't include any change in the way we're going to invest etc., this is just a pro forma without touching the business and just materializing the synergies.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it, so.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just to clarify. There is no basically reinvestment assumed basically in these numbers back into A&P. And as we discussed earlier, in my mind there is not really a need for substantial reinvestment behind the business. There is a need for improvement in return on investment. Investment levels in this business are quite high as they are on both sides. The number one improvement which needs to be had is to improve the ROI on the investment. Now part of the exercise also needs to be is a narrowing of the focus of the business because, and just to give you an example in Fragrances, the number of brands which we will be managing post basically transition is very, very large. And so in order to improve return on investment, we also need to narrow the focus because simply from a go-to-market organization is the number of brands, which will be sitting in the portfolio is too large basically to do an outstanding job. So it's really, it's about focus in ROI.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And sort of related to that last point. So you talked about 6% to 8% of combined new portfolio being rationalized without giving specifics is it fair to think that the focus on that would be in some of the underperforming areas and categories? And I just wanted to relate that to a comment or question on the quarter if you could just talk about the impact of rationalization or discontinuation of certain brands on the businesses as reported today?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So the 6% to 8% of rationalization which needs to take place refers pure and simple to discontinued and divested brand. It does not refer to any reduction in number of doors in wholesale business. So the bulk of that will have to be done. The vast majority will have to be done on the Fragrance category because therein we have the largest numbers of brands between the two portfolios. So it is premature basically to sit here and to have a final discussion about that because the ongoing basically discussions are still taking place with the business in terms of how exactly we're going to structure this.","In terms of impact from the quarter, we are rationalizing doors basically in the quarter and year-to-date and we're also rationalizing lines within the business because historically Coty has basically over the last decades expanded into too many lines, into too many doors in order to have a healthy and a strong business with a very strong focus. And so, I could give you a speculation on the number, but it is clearly not helpful from a growth point of view when you do that. So rationalization and increasing focus is in my mind is a key requirement for this business to be healthy in the long run. And that means some short-term pain that we're going to have to go through.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with CER. Your line is open.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have actually two questions. One is has to do with year one, right. You mentioned that savings are going to be $400 million, but in the filing it seems like there is a temporary agreement with Procter in which it may last six months in which you are going to be hiring services from Procter for the human resources, the IT. So how that $400 million \u2013 you are realizing the savings but at the same time you will need to be spending money against those savings because you don't have the infrastructure yet? That's my first question.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So the answer to this question is that, this is going to be done through TSA, so the TSAs are only on a couple of areas which are mainly finance, IT and supply-chain. And these TSAs allow us to gradually step up and are going to last one year. And so you have this actually in the one-offs so that's part of the $320 million of specific or one-off specific transaction that I have listed, which is the 25% of the overall $1.2 billion, this is including there. So the cost of the TSA are including to the $320 million.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","But you are including that cost as a one-time cost as opposed to an ongoing cost, because these services are going to be rendered for six months?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. You're correct. So these costs that are going to be there for one year are considered as one-off cost.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Okay. So my second question has to do with coming back to the 6% to 8% rationalization and potentially reducing the number of doors and the assumption that was made in the evaluation of the Procter business that the secular growth rate were viewed to be 1.5% and 2.5% positive so this is 2025. So basically the assumptions valuing this business is that, the entirety of the business will be growing even so 10 years down the road and yet what we are sharing is that you are going to reduce the size of the business. So, I do not understand the relationship between what you said about what is your expectation again for the top-line growth on an organic basis of this combined business because in the evaluation it seems that you are implying that it's going to be up to two and a half per year, I guess, down the road, but at the same time everything that you had suggested implies little growth.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","We have never made any basically forward-looking statement regarding the growth of the business either for P&G or for Coty. Right now the P&G business is declining minus 2%. You have the Coty numbers. Clearly what we are working on is to change basically the growth outlook, but we have not made any basically statements forward-looking statements regarding the growth rate of the combined entity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley. Your line is open.","Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Yes, Hi. I guess the previous slides you had provided, were kind of on an EBITDA basis, is there any reconciliation anywhere you'll be providing or any comments that kind of go through these numbers on an EBITDA basis? And the tax rate has been sort of different in different time periods for Coty. What tax rates are you assuming in these EPS calculations? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, so I'm sure on the reconciliation between the EBIT and the EBITDA you can take that later on with our IR team. I think they have all the detail and we'd be able to provide that view. In terms of blended tax rate that we have assumed in the EPS calculation, we have assumed a 26% blended tax rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, so synergies at 16% of sales in this acquisition is far above what we've generally seen from other CPG peers, which have been more in the high single-digit range over time. So, can you run through what's giving you confidence in that number, given it's so much higher than we've seen versus peers in the industry? And then can you give us more of a sense of kind of magnitude for some of the key areas or key buckets of savings with that synergy number?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so we certainly can. So, we've gone through a very exhaustive bottom-up exercise to take a look at all basically pockets of synergies. So, I would say that probably is the one good thing that we are having between this lengthy time between announcement and closure is that we have plenty of time to study everything in excruciating detail which we have done. So, in the supply area we have literally gone through everything in terms of buy, make, and deliver the product and it looked that every single aspect in terms of what we can assume from an optimization point of view in terms of procurement, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of logistics.","We've also have costed out the entire organization down to the last head, practically in every single division as well as in the corporate headquarters and any other functional support staff. We have used that basically in order to cost out entire SG&A footprint for the combined entity. So, there is a very, very detailed basically calculation between all of this. So, in terms of the split, it is very much balanced between I would say broad what is \u2013 which you can expect in cost of goods and in SG&A. There is a relatively even split between the two. The synergy number of 16% is definitely at the high end of the range but it is not basically, these types of numbers have been achieved before in other types of transactions. So it's not like a number which is out of the range.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then Bart, you mentioned a couple of times about wanting to further participate in the consolidation of beauty industry. From a timing standpoint, when should we think about acquisitions becoming a focus again? I would guess there is a pause here as you integrate P&G and Hypermarcas with the heritage Coty reorganization et cetera which might limit acquisitions in the next couple of years, it that fair? How do you look at that from a timing standpoint? And then also, can you just share some of the financial hurdles you look forward in acquisitions, particularly in terms of return criteria? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks for the question. So we usually do not comment about our M&A. It's is the best way to be really effective. And so we're not going to provide a lot of detail. However, the only thing we can say is that for the time being we have to integrate this business and to make sure that the combination of P&G and Coty works, and that we have a very successful integration. So that's going to be the focus of the organization in the coming 18 months.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So in terms of hurdles you know we run your standard approach, so in terms of P&L and cash flow forecast look at \u2013 on not just a discounted cash flows but mostly in terms of how much basically over the cost of capital basically we return, and at what point we breakeven against the cost of capital. So I would say EPS accretion is also being looked at but as you all know most transactions are EPS accretive in the consumer goods space. So that's generally is not the main hurdle because that's almost a given. It's much more basically in terms of return relative to the cost of capital that we look at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey guys, can you just clarify one thing on slide 18? So you have that sort of phasing of synergies. Is that the incremental synergies or is that the aggregative synergy number? So does that exclude like the $380 million from P&G or is that you know just the incremental beyond that?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So I'm not sure I understand the question, but I give you an answer. I think you are right, that's your question but the total level of synergies is $380 million plus $400 million, which is the $780 million that we have quoted.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's clear. But there is that bullet on page 18 that has like the percentage of synergies realized by year you know it's 40%, 70%...","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So this is based on the total, Bill. So this is the split, the phasing per year based on the $780 million.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. It doesn't make a lot of sense though because it seems like that whole $380 million is just allocated overhead so shouldn't that all be gone once you lap it after the deal closes?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. It will go out and equal. And that's why, that is the 40%-plus.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So there is no other \u2013 okay, but there is no other synergies then except for just lapping the overhead allocations?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No, because in the early days, you actually need to staff up before you staff down so you do not, and this is a carve-out, it's you know \u2013 people generally don't get this, but if I combine two companies, I could realize synergies in year one. But we are not getting basically a complete company. We are getting a partial company. And so, in a partial company, I'm actually going to have to staff up to absorb it in order to before I can staff it down. So you have basically, yes, the full $380 million goes away but then you know, I need to have certain resources basically in that organization in order to \u2013 which I can then basically take down once we are integrated.","You have to realize these are three basically steps in the transaction. That is the carve-out and stand-up and stand-up is required from a Reverse Morris Trust point of view. So, P&G actually has to stand up its own organization independently. Then there is the transition phase which is in the transitional services phase and then there is basically the final integration. It's a much more complex process than a normal basically merger of two companies.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That makes senses. Are these synergy numbers net synergy numbers then? Are they net of cost associated with \u2013 do you know what I am saying because that what it sort of implies if you are saying you have to staff up to hit those synergies, do you know what I mean?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes. So, actually the 40% in year one is a net between the synergies that's we are realizing and the staff up that we need to do in order to be able to build the business, the combined business.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense and then just one last one, on the Salon Color business. I mean how long do you think it's going to take you guys to really learn that business? And then do you think you can be successful in the U.S. without owning your distribution because I think that's probably the critical inhibitors that L'Oreal owns their distribution, so they have much better reach into the salons, tell me if you disagree with that? And then maybe some thoughts on that end?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, first of all, on salon, we need to understand that the entire organization comes with the transaction. So, in terms of the entire commercial basically infrastructure comes with the transaction with all the associated staffing. And I would say the good thing about the salon business, it took P&G a while but they actually have figured out how to run this business and you can see in years four, the business is actually doing just fine. And so from a trend point of view, is doing very well. The management team and the entire commercial infrastructure is coming with the business. And they have basically good results behind that.","So, do other people in Coty have to learn certain things about the salon business? Absolutely. But I think there is a lot of work between the two organizations taking place at the moment to make sure that we have a smooth transition of this business. In terms of owning the distribution, well, clearly, I do not agree that we need to own the distribution because we have proven that while not owning the business from a distribution point of view, we can grow the business and certainly on the salon, the salon business in the United States on the P&G side has a very good performance. So I think that in itself proves that the business can succeed without owning the distribution.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. I know these aren't your businesses yet, but what's your assessment of why the mass hair and cosmetics businesses that you're acquiring has been underperforming, particularly since the deal was announced. Basically you have the fiscal 2015 then the first half numbers. And what do you think needs to happen to get these businesses back to health?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, I would say there are several factors. First, it's been hit very hard by FX because part of the business is in places like Brazil, so that's not helpful clearly. Having said that, I don't think that's the bigger issue. The bigger issue is that this has been managed by the corporate sales force and within Procter & Gamble within their hair category. And so when you have a corporate sales force like you have in the United States, which is managing an orphan asset which is being divested, as you can imagine, the focus is not going to stay on it, and this is exactly what's happening.","And, clearly, at Coty, we are quite concerned about the business trends within this business. And so, I think increasing the focus which we will have immediately after close, hopefully is going to help basically nurture this business back to a better performance, but right now, it's an orphan asset being handled by a corporate sales force, which has at least another 20 priorities. So that clearly is not very helpful.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Got it. And just to revisit the year one \u2013 the accretion or the synergy targets, particularly in year one. So $0.50 by year four, but do you have a sense of what pro forma EPS would look like when adding in these businesses in year one, is it just as simple as 40% of that $0.50 target?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","There is \u2013 there is a phasing of the benefits that you can see. So, you could make a certain modeling behind that if you wanted to. We have not provided any guidance on this point.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We are not providing any assumption in terms of the phasing or so on the cost to execute, etc. So I think you can make that assumption, but that's the only thing we can say at this stage.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Lachky with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. My first question is on kind of the status of the innovation for the Procter business. I know \u2013 I remember you guys had some issues when you bought Philosophy as far as the pipeline not being as strong as you had expected and so, and it took multiple years to kind of turn that business around. So I'm just wondering what's your view of the innovation pipeline at Procter?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, we do not have a complete view on that at this stage. We should not forget that the two businesses are competing businesses. And we have not been allowed access from a legal point of view in terms of the innovation pipeline. So that's still to come.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And my second question on slide 24, part of the adjusted EBITDA is a depreciation accounting reclass, and I was wondering if you could just shed some light on what that is and why you guys are handling it as depreciation versus SG&A of Procter? Is it just carve-out accounting or some sort of acquisition related accounting difference, is that the reason for the reclass? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","No, it's carve-out accounting actually. So it's really now we translate the chart of account of P&G into our chart of account and that's the result of this. So that's really fixtures actually that's why we are excited, that's we are replacing .","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. A couple of questions here, first off, you're talking about the 6% to 8% in potential divestitures, and I was wondering is that included in your run rate that you've given us in terms of earnings per share and EBITDA and margins. And then one sort of clarification on the cash costs, do the cash costs include or exclude the CapEx associated, sort of the one-time CapEx. It sounds like those cash costs actually exclude the CapEx? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, no, the rationalization is not included in the run rate EPS or EBITDA numbers at this stage in the game. Right now, basically the first thing we have to determine what exactly we're going to rationalize and what the ramification of that is. So, it is not, specifically not included. On the CapEx?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","On the CapEx, actually, John, your understanding is correct. So, the one-off costs exclude the CapEx impact.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then one final sort of housekeeping question here just because I've been getting questions on it. So obviously deal is closing in FY 2017 sort of probably late Q1, early Q2. So when you look at year one, year two, year three, year four, it is fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020, right, that's how we should be looking at this?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No. The closing is scheduled for October of this year, right, so, yes. So you know the closing will be in FY 2017. Yes.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Excellent.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","You look at the right way.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Javier Escalante with CER. Your line is open.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi, thank you. I would like to go to slide number 20 where you show the pro forma Coty being, 2015 being $1.20 to $1.25 and then four years from now being $1.48 and $1.53. Does it mean that you expect the combined company to grow EPS at 5% organically, this is the way to read this? Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So, no, actually that's not what we are saying in this slide. In this slide what we are saying is that we on the pro forma basis if you have the Coty business, the P&G carve-out business plus the synergies minus D&G and Christina Aguilera you increase your EPS by 50% after year four. We are not speaking about growth rates, underlying improvement of the business, we are not adding Hypermarcas, we are not doing any of this. We are only doing a mathematical exercise where we are saying, we are Coty standalone you know day one the carve-out business from P&G will come plus we will generate some synergies. This is the impact of these three factors into our current EPS, that's all what we are saying, which is already by the way a pretty substantial increase in EPS.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","But just to be clear, so organically on the underlying business, I would not make you know any aggressive assumptions because you have to realize is that the same people, which was doing the integration also have to manage the business just to be crystal clear. So this is a very complex transaction which has to be integrated over the next couple of years. So it's the same people which are doing both.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, Patrice, I just wanted a couple of clarifications and maybe I'm looking at this wrong, there is a lot of info here, but it looks like your pro forma free cash flow expectations moving down to $800 million to $900 million from $900 million previously. Is that correct and why is that given the higher synergy and pro forma EBITDA assumptions? And then also the brands that aren't transferring over Dolce and Aguilera, it looks like you're paying $300 million less in the deal despite losing $130 million in EBITDA, so is that correct or am I missing something on that front? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So, Dara. So first on the $800 million, $900 million Dara, this is at closing. So, this is without the synergies, this is without the working capital synergies. This is not when we receive the business, the pro forma free cash flow generation will more than double day one, that's the way you should look at it, and then you add the working capital synergies and all the rest.","So, now on Christina Aguilera and Dolce & Gabbana, first we have put in the S-4 a conservative assumption, but at the end of the day for the time being, we are not in the driving seat of that. So we need to wait until we see what happens on the D&G and Christina Aguilera before we can draw any conclusion first point. Second point, the $130 million this is not the EBITDA. The $130 million is the gross margin minus the brand investment which is the NCP. The cost structure attached to that is part of the synergies level that we have indicated.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser with B. Riley. Your line is open.","Linda B. Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Hi. Of the $400 million of synergies, excluding the $380 million that are initially recognized how much of that $400 million falls in year one?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So, we have not provided this level of detail. What we have said is that we will generate $780 million, and this $780 million have the phasing of 40%, 70%, 80% and 100%. What you can assume is that the totality of the $380 million are going to materialize day one. Okay? And the first year, as Bart has indicated and as I have indicated, we have to staff-up the organization and stand-up the organization. You need to understand that as Bart said, it is a carve-out.","So what does that mean? This means that P&G is organized with the big share service center called GBS. We do not get any of this. So from a back-office function for instance, we don't get any person to close the books. So we need to staff-up and to stand up our organization in order to be able to close the books of the month one. So that's one example amongst many others.","So I think the way you should look at it is that the $380 million are going to materialize year one, and then you're going to have a couple of investments that we -need to do in order to be able to staff-up the organization. But the true way to look at it is that we're going to generate $780 million of synergies with 16% of the acquired revenues and 70% of that is going to materialize after year two.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Right.

You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release, as well as on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I will now turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Scannavini","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everybody. As anticipated on our last call, and as you read in our earning release, we are facing some challenges at the start of fiscal year \u201914. Today I will begin by describing the key dynamics that are currently impacting our business in the first part of the year, and then how we plan to return to growth in the second half.","Let\u2019s start with the market dynamics, focusing on the key segments where we compete. Today over 70% of our business is in the fragrance segment and nail product category. In those segments, we\u2019ve seen a significant deceleration in the market trends in the last few months. The fragrance market in Q1 was negative 2% in Western Europe and down 1.4% in North America. The trend was slightly negative in prestige and more concerning in mass, while the decline was 4% during the quarter.","Looking at the nail color category, we saw a 4.4% decline in the U.S. mass market in the quarter, and a 7.5% decline in the month of September. This represents a sudden and sharp trend change as the nail market in the U.S. was still growing in the double-digits through May 2013. The decline was mostly triggered by lower consumption of special effects product which boomed in the last two years fuelled by innovation like crackle effect and nail stickers which made nail color one of the most coveted fashion accessories.","As this part of the business is settling to a more normalized level, the overall nail category can't sustain the accelerated growth it enjoyed in the recent past. It is worth noting that the minus 4% trend in the quarter compares to a plus 21% for the same quarter last year, which means that the category has kept most of the substantial growth that has enabled the nail category to become bigger than the lips category in the U.S. market.","The above market dynamics have directly impacted our U.S. business. Lower consumption has generated a significant inventory reduction by the trade, particularly mass retailers across all our product categories. We estimate that these stocking activities impacted our mass business in the quarter in the U.S. by roughly $35 million.","In this context our net revenues in the quarter declined 2.6% on a like-for-like basis. The decline was primarily due to the challenges we described in the U.S. mass market. As a consequence our business in the Americas declined 10% in the first quarter. In the remaining regions our business grew with EMEA up 2% and Asia Pacific up 7% on a like-for-like basis.","Overall, emerging markets grew 8%. Our global travel retail business grew in the double-digits ahead of the traffic increase pace. By channel our revenue decline was entirely driven by the mass market while our prestige business had healthy mid-digit growth.","Let\u2019s now analyze in more detail our business by region. In EMEA our business expanded by 2% like-for-like driven by strong performance in the UK, Middle East and travel retail. In Europe and particularly South and Eastern Europe, the business climate remained soft and uncertain. The intense competition for market share in declining markets has led to pricing pressure and greater focus on promotion and value offers. This is particularly true in the mass market, where discounting has increased. This business dynamic is impacting our gross margin as trade discount and promotion are deteriorating our gross to net revenues ratio.","In the Americas, our business was down 10% on a like-for-like basis. The decline was triggered by the U.S. mass business, which was severely impacted by the concession slowdown and retailer destocking in the markets where we compete. There is a cautious sentiment for the upcoming Christmas season. Retailers are ordering Christmas promotion at this lower trend than last year.","So far, this has not resulted in order cancellation. While business is challenging in the U.S., our business Latin America is growing fast. In the quarter, we recorded a 15% increase driven by travel retail, Chile and Brazil. Our new joint venture in Brazil has started operating at the very end of September, and we expect to see the impact of our new setup in the second half. Our door-to-door fragrance business with Jequiti is off to a good start and the most recent launch of Playboy fragrance has been the most successful fragrance launch ever handled by our Brazilian partner.","Our Asia-Pacific business grew 7% on a like-for-like basis. Australia and Southeast Asia were the key drivers for growth. In Southeast Asia, we benefited from the initial impact of our new StarAsia subsidiary and the healthy development of our prestige business.","Looking at our product segments; we register 1% like-for-like growth in fragrance, despite the soft market trend we discussed earlier. The growth in the segment was supported by our power brands in prestige spurred by innovation in Calvin Klein, Chlo\u00e9, Davidoff and Marc Jacobs, as well as increasing contribution from Roberto Cavalli and Katy Perry.","On the other hand, our Musk fragrance business was affected by the slow market dynamic and by a launch fazing which this year is favoring the second half. While in the first of last year, we had the huge Lady Gaga launch, which makes for a tough comparison to this first half.","After several quarters of growth ahead of market pace in the segment and geographies where we compete, color was the segment which suffered the most from the mass market trader stocking in the U.S., and ended the quarter down 10%. Particularly affected were our nail business and the Sally Hansen brand, which holds one-third of the total nail mass market in the U.S. Impacting Sally Hansen performance was not only the sudden decline of market demand and the related sharp inventory reduction by trade, but also the escalated competitive environment with many new players competing in the nail arena with increasing investments. To be noted that net of the nail category our core cosmetic business was only marginally lower.","Rimmel kept growing though at a slower pace as this brand also was somewhat impacted by the genre of the stocking in the U.S. market. Just to give an idea of this dynamic, Rimmel consumption performance in the U.S. in Q1 was outstanding with sell-through growing 21% in Q1 while sell-in inched up just 2% in the same period. It is worth highlighting the Rimmel has been the fastest growing color brand in the U.S. mass market among the top-10 brands in the last 12 months.","The skin and body care segment was flat as reported and down 2% like-for-like. Here the good news comes from philosophy, which had solid growth for the second quarter in a row. In the U.S., the brand recorded consumption growth mostly driven by good initial result of our new innovation program. Particularly strong was the growth in our direct-to-consumer business with both TV sales through QEC and e-commerce growing in the double-digits.","Also, the brand\u2019s international expansion is off to an encouraging start with good results coming from the UK from the first doors opened in Asia. The Adidas business was in line with the previous year, growth in the emerging markets was offset by softness in the European market and the U.S. In China while TJoy revenues declined in the quarter the new TJoy management is progressing with the reorganization and reengagement of the distribution network.","We expect to see the first positive impact of this activity start in Q3 together with the launch of an exciting new moisturizer line. While we keep investing in strengthening our structure in the emerging markets and investing behind our brands initiative, we are keeping tight control of our administrative cost. During this quarter, our administrative cost declined by approximately 3 million on a cost currency basis, reflecting our focus on cost containment.","We are also progressing in line with our target on our productivity plan which is expected to generate 40 million to 45 million savings over the next three years.","Looking now at the short-term outlook, we expect to see challenges continuing in the course of Q2. As the turbulence in the U.S. market is not over yet and we could see further destocking and cautious ordering until the segments were recomplete start showings more encouraging trends. Also we have some unfavorable innovation phasing in comparison with Q2 versus the same period last year.","Looking to the second half, we expect to return to top-line growth, as several key products and distribution initiatives will kick in Q3. We anticipate the most of these initiatives will structurally enhance our growth potential helping to recover trajectory towards our long-term strategy to grow in line or better than the markets and segments where we complete.","Let me mention some of these key initiatives. In prestige fragrances we have two important initiatives in second half on Calvin Klein with the launch of Endless Euphoria an important line extension to our iconic Euphoria franchise and the launch of CK One Red, a fragrance for him and her which we expect will resonate particularly with young European consumer.","We also anticipate our mass fragrance business will be energized by important launches in Beyonce and by the introduction of the new fragrance and body line called Love2Love in exclusivity with a top mass retailer developed to cover the low price point segment with a high quality floral product offering great value for the money.","Speaking on new fragrance brand I can\u2019t help sharing our satisfaction and ambition behind the newly signed Miu Miu license. Until recently Miu Miu was one of the few big global fashion properties without a fragrance license. It is one of the most successful and fastest growing brands in fashion with a strong personality and attributes which create a perfect fit for fragrance.","We are very excited the Prada Group chose Coty as their partner in this important step, which we believe is an acknowledgement of our outstanding track-record in building and cultivating strong and lasting brands. We are confident in our ability to build this brand into one of our power brands to strengthen our leadership position in the prestige fragrance market.","The first launch is scheduled for calendar year 2015. In color, our main objective is to resume share growth in Sally Hansen. We expect positive impact from the Triple Shine launch which is underway as we speak. We are also working on an exciting major innovation to be introduced at the end of this fiscal year. ","In OPI, growth will come mostly from new distribution opportunities in the U.S. and the acceleration of the international business. In the U.S., we have signed a distribution agreement with a sizable chain in the professional business with OPI set to enter approximately 2,700 new doors. Also, we have agreed on a first step of corporation with another major prestige retailer distributing OPI in few top doors.","We expect this together with a number of new outstanding creative collections to spur and acceleration OPI growth in the U.S. in the balance of the fiscal year. We plan to leverage our multichannel distribution capabilities to accelerate OPI international expansion in the prestige and professional channels.","In Q3, we are scheduled to begin directly manage OPI retail business in key countries such as UK, Germany, Italy and Australia which we anticipate to boost brand investment and revenues. We have seen the success of this strategy in Spain and in travel retail where after a few months OPI was one of the top two prestige nail brands in both markets.","In skin and body care, we plan to restore growth, particularly thanks to Adidas. We expect the brand to leverage our progress in emerging markets, particularly in Brazil and in China where in January, we plan to launch a male shampoo as a first step to establish the brand after male shower get and male skin care.","Upside opportunities will also come from the launch of the Get Ready line inspired by the upcoming soccer World Cup. We also expect further progress in our philosophy business, thanks to the national rollout of the newly launched time in a bottle which is off to a very promising start as well as new initiatives under the miracle worker franchise. ","In the second half, we target a clear boost to our growth from our business acceleration in the emerging markets. We expect to see the impact of our new setup in Brazil and Southeast Asia.","In addition I am happy to announce that we just opened a new Coty subsidiary in South Africa. Through an agreement with our current distributor Indigo, that will act in the future as the sales manufacturing and logistics provider. Indigo which is part of the AVI Group is one of the leaders of South African beauty market. Thus, enjoying strong market penetration and excellent trade relations.","The establishment of our owned subsidiary will allow us to step us investment behind our mass brands, with focus on power brands such as Adidas and Rimmel, which are already strong franchises in South Africa. Also our South Africa subsidiary will act as a hub to improve our penetration in the Sub-Saharan region. We're confident that the establishment of this subsidiary will allow us to build Coty's share in this fast growing emerging areas.","In summary, while we are presently confronting some challenges, we\u2019re focused on our long-term business strategy, particularly leveraging the growth in our power brands and emerging market acceleration. We believe we have a strong and concrete action plan that's starting in the second half should bring us back to long-term growth trajectory, even in the presence of unfavorable trends in the markets segments where we compete.","I will now hand the call over to Sergio, who will bring you through the key financials of the quarter.","Sergio Pedreiro","Thank you, Michele and good morning everyone. First I would like to remind all of you that my commentary today on our results and outlook includes discussion of adjusted results which excludes the impact of non-recurring items, private company share-based compensation and restructuring costs. When applicable I will also discuss our adjusted results at constant currency. This presentation is consistent with how we plan to report results and provide our outlook in future quarters.","You can find the bridge from reported to adjusted results including foreign exchange translation impact in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release. In the first quarter, we saw a decrease in net revenues of 2.6% on a like-for-like basis, consistent with our comments on our last earnings call this was good to a significant deceleration in the market trends in the last few months.","And as Michele discussed the decline was primarily due to the challenge we described in the U.S. market. Despite this challenging backdrop, we delivered revenue growth in our business outside of the Americas, driven by EMEA and Asia Pacific including travel retail.","Our gross margin decreased to 59.9% from 60.7% in the prior year, this 80 basis points reduction reflected higher customer discounts in allowances, as well as negative foreign currency impact, which more than offset the improvement we saw in cost of goods from our supply chain savings program, as well as some positive mix reflecting growth in our higher margin prestige business.","Our reported operating income remains stable at 165.6 million versus 165.9 million in the prior year. As lower net revenues and the decreasing gross margin was largely offset by lower SG&A. The primary driver of lower SG&A was the change from liability stock option plan accounting to equity plan accounting following our IPO in June of 2013.","Our adjusted operating income at constant currency declined 7% to 188.3 million from 203 million. As a percentage of net revenues adjusted operating margin at constant currency decreased 70 basis points from 16.7% last year to 16% this year. This decline was primarily driven by lower gross margin. We remained focused on controlling our administrative costs while continuing to invest in our brands. As a result, adjusted SG&A expense remained flat at 42.2% of net revenues and decreased 30 basis points to 41.9% at constant currency.","This reduction reflected lower administrative costs which declined by approximately 3 million at constant currency and lowered advertising and consumer promotion while increasing trade marketing expense. Importantly total marketing investment behind our brands which includes advertising and consumer promotion as well as trade marketing expense increased by 20 basis points as a percentage of net revenues.","As a reminder, trade marketing expense which is booked as a reduction to net revenues, includes advertising and consumer promotion expense for which we're reimbursed, we reimbursed the trade such as co-op advertisement, in-store displays, in-store promotions and exclusive launch related expenses and it does not include any discounts and allowances.","Our productivity program launched in the last quarter of fiscal 2013 remains on-track to deliver at least 45 million of annualized savings when fully implemented in fiscal year 2016.","Looking at our performance by segment, we saw expansion on our operating margin, both in fragrances and in skin and body care. This improvement was more than offset by pressures in the color cosmetic segment. Adjusted operating income for the fragrance segment increased 14% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2013 while the operating margin expanded by 260 basis points to 21.7%.","Our skin and body care adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points, as we continue to anticipate gradual improvement in this segment as we grow its scale and streamline operations. Color continued to face a challenging business environment with significant destocking in the U.S., a slowdown in nail and the increased competitive activity that drove higher discounting and allowances.","Revenues declined by 36 million, and we saw this impact flow through the P&L resulting in a $37 million decline in the segments adjusted operating income. And in an adjusted operating margin that declined to 11.8% from 21.1% in the previous year. The margin decline in our color business was primarily driven by lower volume, higher discounts and the increased marketing spending to protect our position in a challenging market environment.","We expect to increase our margins in second half as volumes progressively recover upon trades, inventories normalizations. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.7%, compared to 32.4% in the previous year. The decrease was caused by a higher effective rate in the prior year, due to the expected expiration of certain U.S. tax credits on foreign source income that were reinstalled in 2013.","For the full year we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 28%, plus or minus 3. The increase in Q1 rate versus the 28% full year tax rate reflects a normally higher rate in the first quarter, given the fact of discrete items and also a change in the expected mix of profits with higher profits in higher tax jurisdictions reflecting for example faster growth in the emerging markets.","During the quarter cash paid in income taxes was 10.5% of adjusted income before income taxes, reflecting the benefits of historical net operating losses in the U.S. and Germany, as well as the tax deductibility of goodwill amortization for OPI and philosophy. For the full year, we continue to expect a cash tax rate of 18%, plus or minus 3%.","Reported net income increased by 8% to $93.5 million as a result of stable operating income and lower tax rates. On an adjusted basis our net income decreased by 8% to 108.3 million primarily reflecting lower adjusted operating income partially offset by lower income taxes. Accordingly, our adjusted net income margin income margin decreased 50 basis points to 9.2% this year.","Despite the weakness we saw in some of our key markets and the consequent top-line and margin pressures, I am particularly proud of our strong execution in continuing to improve net working capital efficiency with positive impact on our cash flow. In the first quarter we achieved net working capital improvement in accounts payables, inventory and receivables.","These resulted in an increase of 123 million in net cash provided by operating activities, excluding cash used for private company stock option exercised in the prior year. And that\u2019s the 66 million in capital expenditures our free cash flow was $36 million in the quarter, which is an increase of 117 million compared to last year\u2019s negative 82 million.","With that I would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","I wanted to ask two questions. The first one is can you talk a little bit about the cadence of holiday selling? Is it different than what you have seen previously? And if so, is it sort of the similar channels and geographies where you were seeing issues in this most recent quarter? And then, the second question to get a little bit more detail oriented, you have got a much easier gross margin comparison, but you're still obviously seeing a lot of this promotional pressure. Can you talk -- from the second quarter you have got an easier comparison, can you talk a little bit about the cadence of gross margin as we go through the year, as you lap that easier comparison and then look for what hopefully is a more normal environment in the second half? Thank you.","Michele Scannavini","So let\u2019s talk first of what is our view on the holiday season. So let me say that. At this stage it is very difficult to predict what is going to happen for the holiday season. What we have seen clearly is that as I said before the first quarter has been soft in terms of market particularly in the segment where we compete. We have seen cautious ordering of Christmas sets and promotion from the retailer. Talking with retailer they are cautious in their estimate and in their guidance for the Christmas season also considering as you know very well that we have six days less than last year to generate sales and consumption.","So as I said on my script we don\u2019t see so far order cut, still I believe the retailers are planning to have at least a moderate growth in Christmas season but honestly I believe that everybody is bit in a wait and see situation and to see if October and November are confirming a certain come back. As you know the Christmas business is extreme important into country into region U.S. and UK.","I should say that we see in this moment a similar attitude also in UK there is very cautious sentiment for the Christmas season as of now and we have seen particularly in UK an increase of the promotional fight before the Christmas season in the back-to-school season. So I think that at this stage is difficult to predict and we are just trying to caliber our business and projection based on what we\u2019re going to see progressing in the next weeks.","As far as gross margin.","Sergio Pedreiro","John I mean as we discussed I mean our gross margin is clearly under pressure given the volume impact given the discount activity that we see in the market. And given the decision that we take to protect our market position and protect our brands both in terms of investing more in trade marketing spend to support the brands together with the trade and also in some cases taking discounts to protect our position.","Going forward I mean if we see the trade inventories normalizing we will also benefit from that. The overall orientation and decision to protect our brands, protect our market\u2019s position will continue and therefore it will be much more dependent on how fast we see these trade inventory normalization to be able to see also the benefits flowing through our margins.","Operator","And your next question comes from Olivia Tong, BofA Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch","First just one quick housekeeping, how much of a sales contribution did you get from the acquired third-party distributors? And then secondly why are you so confident in the second half sales improvement? You have obviously got a few innovation initiatives in the emerging markets build which is great but it also sounds like male got quite a bit worse and that destocking was also worse.","Michele Scannavini","Okay, let me start with the second part. As I said before I believe there are two key reasons why we are so confident in coming back to growth in the second half. The first one is clearly related to old investment that we did in emerging markets to create a setup to develop our business. And I am talking specifically of the setup that we have created in Brazil that we have created in Southeast Asia that we created earlier in last fiscal year in Korea, the new one that we have created now in South Africa.","And on top of that I am also referring to the numbers of specific product initiative geared and paired for these emerging markets. I was talking before for instance of the launch of Adidas shampoo in China as well as the continuous development of specific fragrance for Middle East with kind of Arabian effect and duration that is boosting big time our business today in Middle East. So the first reason why I believe that we\u2019re going to get back and we are targeting to go back to a growth in the second half is because of the impact on the emerging market.","Then there is second point that are related to more specific activities on our power brands and particularly in the color category that in this moment is suffering more than the others related to both particularly strong initiative plan and distribution initiative that will enlarge the scope of our key brands like Sally Hansen and OPI and will allow us to reach more consumer. So those are clearly two let me say building block for make us targeting come back to growth.","Now related to the market trends, you\u2019re right actually we have seen for instance a trend in nail color that we couldn\u2019t anticipate and the sharp deceleration, so it\u2019s difficult for us at this stage to anticipate if it\u2019s going to be a short or medium trend. As I was explaining before most of the decline is related to that part of the business that is special effect, while, let me say the more basic bottle and the brush, more basic nail color business is sustaining but as I said before in script, I believe that the strength of our initiative and the initiative in emerging market, by the way we\u2019ll enhance structurally our ability to growth will allow us to target growth even in presence of difficult market condition.","Sergio Pedreiro","So, in terms of the sales contribution from third-party distribution, well, let me explain first, I mean this is part of our business model, this is something that we have done and we believe is a good approach to entering market where we start to build our presence together with the distributor we see the brand build momentum. At some point, we may form a joint venture or we may convert them.","In terms of the sale dynamic during this conversion, normally what happens is before the transaction itself sales tends to go down after the transaction in the first couple of months there is normally, I worked with the distributor that have a brand from other companies that are discontinued. So the first impact is normally very small pickup or may even be slightly negative.","The benefit comes with the conversion because now as with fully-owned subsidiary, we have the margins of the business that we can invest increase the marketing and then see the sales pickup and see the full potential of the market metalize. That is happening normally in the second and third quarter after the acquisition. The one that we\u2019re talking about is very recent I mean we just completed the Southeast Asian acquisition and we should see that dynamic develop and bring benefits towards the second half.","Michele Scannavini","Yes. This is something that we have seen consistently in all the joint ventures that we created in the past. We created joint venture that we have the majority of stake in Middle East, joint venture in prestige China, joint venture in Southeast Asia prestige. And so far we\u2019ve seen exactly the dynamic of the business that Sergio was describing a development due to a direct control of the business more investment counting on the full margin, and not splitting the margin with the distributor and the progressive build of business and market share. These are exactly what we expect to see from the most recent setup.","Operator","And your next audio question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hey, can you just talk about how you are seeing October trends, because there has been some conflicting data out there? And I think L'Oreal was pretty cautious about October and said the consumer, and even in the U.S., was looking for a deal a lot more than they had in the past, so it looks like the holiday season is going to be a lot more promotional? So any color you can give on that would be terrific.","Michele Scannavini","","As I was saying before of my script I do not expect to see improvement in the next quarter. The trends that we have seen in terms of consumption, promotionality and attention to managing inventory down didn\u2019t change in October. So, as I said before, I believe there is still -- we're going to face challenges in our second quarter and we are targeting to come back to growth from Q3 on.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank ","Sergio, just in terms of the inventory levels, obviously on the working capital side it looks like it was terrific. So I am a little bit confused because if you had all this destocking, you would think that you'd have a big spike up in inventory as a result of destocking. So where am I wrong on that assumption?","Sergio Pedreiro","Yes, I mean what we have seen -- and this is more on the mass side, what we have seen is a trend of volumes coming down and we -- if you look back at our results of few quarter you could see that the level of inventory was stable or increasing. That despite a few months ago when initiative, internal initiative to increase our efficiency in inventory which actually worked very well because at the same time that we see an acceleration in the business, we see an improvement in terms of days of inventory and therefore helping the total amount to be still going down in spite of the lower volume. So this is really the dynamic that is riding the efficiencies in our working capital.","Michele Scannavini","Yes I must say that to add that we have a very, very effective connection between markets agreement planning so we are pretty fast in adjusting our production schedule and inventory depending on the trend that we see in the market and reasons are, we saw and we discussed also these last time the trend of nail going down pretty dramatically in the market so we have adjusted our manufacturing schedule very, very fast and this allow us to manage our inventory to a very good level despite these fluctuation on the marketplace. ","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank ","And then, just lastly, can you just give us the breakdown now of the business? I know it used to be 50-50 between mass and prestige, and I know you said that prestige grew mid-single digits, so if it is still 50-50, how much did the mass business decline in the quarter?","Michele Scannavini","So let say that the split of the business doesn\u2019t change materially, we\u2019re clearly having prestige growing and mass declining this is going to shift the split more versus prestige but the difference doesn't change the overall picture. So still our business is by enlarge 50-50 between prestige and mass.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","And then, so how much -- because you said prestige is up mid-single, so just to kind of back into it, does that mean that mass is down 8%, about, if you get it back into the negative 3?","Michele Scannavini","Look we are not disclosing as you know but I mean you can make your own calculation and try to figure out what is the trend. The reality is that clearly in this moment we see very different trend between our business in prestige our business in mass and I must say that this is particularly true in the U.S. for the reason that we discussed before.","Operator","And the next question comes from Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","You mentioned you expected to grow in line or above the category in the back half of the year. I am just wondering, are you expecting category growth similar to your 3% to 4% long-term range in the back half or do you think some of this recent weakness could linger a bit from a category perspective as we look out to the second half of the year?","Michele Scannavini","Yes let me say it is first of all given the volatility of the markets now is a little bit difficult to anticipate what it is going to be. So I believe that the overall market and particularly the segment where we compete are going to grow in the next few months and including the second half a bit slower than the trend that it had before, so that we\u2019re clearly targeting a growth that is above what we see in the Coty weighted business scope.","Particularly we do not anticipate a trend -- a continuous negative trend as we have seen so far in the nail segment particularly in the second half when obviously the comparison will progressively become easier for the category. Again remember as I said before that today the market in the quarter was minus 4% comparing to plus 21% that was last quarter, last year.","Progressively the comparison would become less tough, so it means also the -- let me say trend of the market should be eased up by an easier comparison.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","And then, I was hoping you could highlight if there are additional cost-savings opportunities that you guys are looking at, beyond your announced productivity program, to help offset some of the profit impact from this category weakness that we are seeing?","Michele Scannavini","Yes, I mean naturally when see a slowdown in the market, we look for opportunities where we can take savings -- as we commented and when you look at our SG&A on an adjusted basis you see a reduction already in the first quarter. And we think this will continue to flow through our results moving forward. So yeah there are few opportunities in addition to the restructuring, not I will say large and significant but we constantly look for them and this helps in terms of keeping the cost under control and contributing to offset any negative impacts of this slowdown.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","And we should look at that as more belt-tightening type of cost cutting than something that is really incremental from a productivity standpoint?","Michele Scannavini","That is correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from Neely Tamminga, Piper Jaffray.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","So I have a couple questions here, if I may. So first on the Miu Miu, is there any way that you could help us contextualize how big you think that this business could be for you? Are you treating it as one of your key power brands, or considering that it doesn't have a road map necessarily in fragrance at this point in time, how should we be thinking about it? And then related to that from a modeling perspective, it sounds like you're going to launch it in 2015. Is that fiscal or calendar 2015? Is it going to launch for, like let's just say, holiday '14, so your fiscal '15? And how should we be thinking about the A&P spending related to that brand-new launch? And then, I have two follow-ups. Thanks.","Michele Scannavini","First of all let me say that Miu Miu is one of the biggest fastest growing more interesting brand in fashion that was without a fragrance agreement. And worked on it for several months with a strong determination, because we believe that Miu Miu can be a great brand for fragrance, I believe it can be part of our power brands. I believe that is a brand that can have a potential just to refer to some brand of our portfolio similar to Chlo\u00e9 is a brand that has a good awareness globally, is a brand that is very strong in Europe and also in Asia and it is a brand that has a very, very strong personality. And as you know to be successful in fragrance with all the different number of brands you have 12 clear point of difference. And we believe that the brand has a clear point of difference starting with the name. Miu Miu is a fantastic name for a fragrance. So we are ambitious, we believe that in the long run it can have a potential of the Chlo\u00e9 so it can clearly be among our power brands.","In terms of the planning, we, at the moment, are targeting to launch the first Miu Miu fragrance in September 2015, so it is a calendar year \u201915. In terms advertising spending, it\u2019s clearly a bit early to discuss about that. But usually with this kind of brand with the potential that they have and strong and high image position on the market in the first year or two you invest a lot of money to be sure that you establish faster business that is strong enough and important enough to be a real contributor to the revenue of our fragrance segment.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","And then just a big-picture question for you, you guys have talked pretty publicly about potential acquisition targets and the profiles related to that. I am just wondering with some of the movement that we\u2019ve seen on the unexpected side of the color cosmetics business skewing a little bit more towards mass, would you be looking forcing diversification in that segment at this point in time based on prestige or maybe even mass-tege or are you looking for brands that have single-country dominance that can roll out to these emerging markets, or has there not been any change whatsoever in your acquisition target or thinking? Thank you.","Michele Scannavini","So first of all let me say one thing. So we believe that the slowdown that we\u2019ve seen in color cosmetic is a short-term impact. We still have lot of a confidence on the long-term potential of expansion on the color cosmetic segment. And we are still bullish in expanding and investing behind our power brands in the color cosmetic segment. So we still believe this is going to be an important driver for our growth in the future.","In terms of our acquisition strategy it\u2019s not changing, we are looking to potential moves that is going to improve our competitiveness in area in which today we believe we can increase our competitiveness. Clearly, this area includes segment like skin and body care, includes emerging markets where we are making significant effort. But I can tell you this do not exclude for instance fragrance and color where we have a strong position today but we are welcoming opportunity to even strengthen our leadership and leverage on all potential revenues and cost of synergies coming from acquisition in those segments. So we are really looking for things that are clearly improving our position in the marketplace and that financially make sense and are accretive.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Ferrara, Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","Guys, I just wanted to talk about color a little bit. I understand the cost of deleveraging is or the fixed-cost deleveraging is a big piece of the margin decline. But I guess to what extent can you parse out how much of this is competition, right? And has your thought process shifted at all to perhaps you are seeing more semi-permanent erosion in category economics because of that competition? I was just hoping you can comment on that.","Michele Scannavini","I can start answering Sergio then you can add to what I am saying. So let me say first of all our decline in color margin is mostly volume driven. There has been an impact due to the increased promotional activity in marketplace and we participate to protect our market share. But this is also driven by the fact that we didn\u2019t decrease to the contrary we increased our marketing spending to defend our share position. So if you look overall what\u2019s happening there is the nail category U.S. where we have strong leadership with Sally Hansen with Sally Hansen we lost market share in recent quarters and we are now working to ensure to connect all the dot that we have the right initiative and investment to stop this decline and to come back to market share growth.","On the other side, we have a brand like Rimmel that is our biggest color brand that is gaining market share big time everywhere in the world. And as I said before for instance in the United States has been the fastest growing color brand among the top-10 in the last 12 months, in the last four months and in the last month.","We are clearly looking now and even more in the second half to restore growth and to protect or restore market share when we lost market share. And this is our number one priority. That means that we will keep on focusing, and we will not compromise on investment behind our power brands even in situation in which the market is unfavorable with this decline. This might put pressure on our margin we are confident of this but we believe that our number one priority now is to restore good and sustaining top-line growth and this is going to be our focus going forward.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","And I guess what made Sally Hansen\u2019s market share vulnerable like I guess, I understand the category dynamics but what specifically went on there I mean you think it was a lack of near-term innovation and I understand did you have a larger share of the special products that were out last year and that\u2019s why share is down now. Just trying to understand that dynamic?","Michele Scannavini","Well let me say there are I should say two explanations here. The number one explanation is that when competition has seen the nail market developing at the pace of the market developed in the last two years and we\u2019re talking of growth that range from 10%, 15% even to 30% depending on the month and on the quarter. The appetite has increased dramatically and we have seen in the last 18 months, 24 months, the entry of numerals new brands that were not existing in the nail category. Many of them with a very, very aggressive price positioning so offering very low prices and on the other side the big player increasing investment behind the category. So this has impacted clearly the competitive position of Sally Hansen and where before Sally Hansen was hugely with very little competition and now the competition is much higher, much stronger.","Number two, what you mentioned is the said that Sally Hansen has always been leader in innovation and he has created and build a lot of increasing market share behind those very fashionable innovation that has brought a strong gain in the share brand, but now they are feeling a bit of a dig so we see as I said before they want the basic business is keeping position and we are keeping our share in this basic business though decline of the total category and particularly Sally Hansen is mostly focused in the special effects.","So, to get to that we are focusing our future innovation on area that we believe that can be more sustainable on the long run, we will also continue to offer consumer entertaining and fun special effects because anyway this is a compliment that is important to the category but we\u2019re going to refocus more our attention, let me say on basic product, performance of basic product and innovation related more to the performance than to the let me say fashionable statics. So those were two reasons why we lost market share and also I answer how we plan to go back to increase our market share.","Operator","And your next question is from Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","My question is with just following up on that, actually, with regard to the nail category, and given how much you have seen the nail category slow down, is there a chance as you go into the new year and some of the drugstores do their planograms and what not, is there a chance that the shelf space allocated to the nail category shrinks? And then, secondarily, I know you said you have -- was it 2,700 new doors for OPI or what exactly is the new distribution relationship? Thanks.","Michele Scannavini","Okay, first question. Now, obviously is very difficult for me to speculate it was going to be the trade decision when they do, they\u2019ve already said and this is happening usually in January-February. So, in few months we will see.","I believe that we are not going to see a reduction or a significant reduction of the space unless remember that nail today is bigger than lips so the growth has been enormous. And I believe that given that the decline is mostly due to the special effects if we are able to replace the impact of the special effects with innovation that are exciting to the consumer and more sustainable on the long run I think it\u2019s going to be a very good reason for the retailer to keep on believing and insisting on the category. But honestly this is going to be reviled to us in January and February when it\u2019s going to be down the reset of the world.","Another discussion that we\u2019re having with the trade now is related to the value of the category because of decline is also driven by the fact that as I said before many cheap brand and value for money brands got into the category not increasing the overall consumption or use but reducing the value of the total category. And we are firmly convinced that the right way is to insist on product that bring real added value to the consumer not only based on price as such as stopping the decline you to reduce value of the overall category and bring back an healthy growth that is volume and its value as well.","As far as OPI, yes this is a new distribution agreement with a big, big professional chain the sub product to a professional institution and we are going to be in 2,700 new doors for OPI this represents around 50% of the total chain door count. And this is going start happening as we speak and this clearly we see as an important contribution to the OPI business in U.S. impacting particularly in the second half.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Matthew, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Wednesday, May 14.","Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, please go ahead.","Kevin Monaco","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. On today's call are Michele Scannavini, Chief Executive Officer; and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations do not reflect certain nonrecurring and other charges, and the discussion of our revenue growth is on a like-for-like basis and, therefore, constitute non-GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release.","I will now turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Scannavini","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Before I begin my comments regarding our business results, I wanted to take a moment to welcome Patrice on his first quarterly call with Coty. Patrice has now been with Coty for several months and will be reviewing the financials during his prepared remarks.","Let's turn now to our quarterly results. On the last call, we outlined several Coty initiatives, which gave us confidence that we would return to revenue growth in the second half. Specifically, we discussed our new structures and investment in emerging markets, increased support behind our power brands and some key launches and product initiatives.","Today, I'm pleased to say that we have started reaping the benefits of our efforts. And in Q3, we delivered against all 3 strategic objectives. Our emerging market revenues increased 15% in the quarter. Most of our power brands saw growth, and the launches we outlined for Q3 are performing in line or ahead of expectations. As a result, overall revenues grew 2% like-for-like in the third quarter, with positive results in both Fragrances and Skin & Body Care, and solid growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific.","Looking at the market dynamics in the quarter, beauty consumption in the developed markets remained overall flat in the product segments where we compete. Western Europe witnessed some improvements across several product categories, including color cosmetics, deodorants and shower gels. At the same time, the fragrance market remained flat to slightly positive after adjusting for Easter shift.","In the U.S., the market environment remains challenging, particularly in the mass channel. The fragrance market, adjusting for the calendar effect, was flat in prestige and declining in mass. The U.S. mass color market decelerated again in Q3, recording a 2% decline. We saw even stronger decline in the nail category, with 12% consumption decrease compared to a 12% increase in Q3 of last year. This represents a further deceleration versus the mid-single-digit decline in the first half.","Lower consumption was driven by lower traffic in store, high inventory in consumers' houses and the contraction of the special effects makeup category. On a positive note, we saw moderate destocking across our mass retail customers in the U.S. as inventory positions are now, by and large, reflecting the underlying category demand trends.","At this stage, we have no visibility on when the U.S. mass channel market will improve in color, particularly in nail. However, we have reason to be optimistic about our business in the second part of the calendar year due to a stronger innovation calendar, including Sally Hansen robust launch planned for June. Also, the comparison versus the prior year is going to ease up as in the second half of calendar 2013, the nail category shifted to a mid-single-digit decline.","Against this backdrop, our third quarter revenues grew 2% on a like-for-like basis. Our prestige portfolio saw strong growth in the quarter, also aided by the easier comparison to the prior year, where prestige fragrances declined 1%. Our mass portfolio was overall flat in the quarter, rebounding from the pressure we saw in the first part of the year.","Let's now look more closely at our performance in each of our segments. In Fragrances, our revenues increased 6% on a like-for-like basis. During the quarter, we saw growth in both our prestige and mass fragrances. On the prestige side, growth was driven by strong performance in our power brands: Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Davidoff. Leveraging its strong brand recognition worldwide, Calvin Klein recorded significant revenue growth in emerging markets such as the Middle East, Australia, Eastern Europe, China and Travel Retail. Calvin Klein launches in Q3 are off to a good start. The launch of Endless Euphoria in the U.S. propelled double-digit growth on the total Euphoria franchise, with gains in ranking and market share.","Our growth in mass fragrances primarily resulted from the new fragrance initiatives such as Beyonc\u00e9 Rise, Guess Night and David Beckham Classic and distribution expansion for Katy Perry. Additionally, as we discussed on our last call, we launched an exclusivity with Walmart and the enterprise fragrance brand called LOVE 2 LOVE. We are proud to say LOVE 2 LOVE was the #1 new fragrance brand launched in Q3 at Walmart, exceeding our expectation.","Color Cosmetics declined 6% on a like-for-like basis, which is an improvement versus the minus 10% we witnessed in the segment in the first half of the year. We experienced continued headwinds in nail, driven by further declines in the nail category, difficult comps for Sally Hansen up against last year's strong launch of the premium-priced [indiscernible] and pressure on Sally Hansen market share. While we are progressing in our comprehensive plan to upgrade and rejuvenate several elements for Sally Hansen mix, including online, offline and in-store image and communication, we are getting ready to launch in June the next blockbuster initiative for Sally Hansen.","As anticipated in our previous call, we are refocusing our effort on developing new products to set the new standard of performance in the nail category. This new Sally Hansen product, called Miracle Gel, will provide consumer with the highest standard of nail lacquer performance, guaranteed by the gel formula with a much easier, faster and consumer-friendly application. In contrast to classic gel formulation, Miracle Gel will not need curing with an artificial light and can be removed as easily as normal nail polish. The launch will be supported by an extremely strong communication plan, including digital, TV and print advertising, and retailers are granting strong in-store visibility and support. We are optimistic that this initiative will help Sally Hansen regain momentum in the second half of this calendar year.","While we are challenged on the nail category, Rimmel continued its strong performance, with revenue growth in the U.K., France, Eastern Europe, Middle East, South Africa and Australia. The brand continued to gain share in the U.S. and core European markets, speaking to the success of Rimmel innovation and marketing platform.","In Skin & Body Care, revenues grew 8% like-for-like. We witnessed broad-based growth in the segment, driven by our 2 power brands, philosophy and adidas, and by Lancaster. We continue to see solid growth momentum in philosophy for the fourth consecutive quarter and increases across all the 3 channels, including retail, QVC and philosophy.com. With growth coming from both new innovation and core franchises, we believe the brand has resumed traction in the core U.S. market.","We also see good progress in the international developments. In U.K., our second biggest market after North America, the brand is making encouraging inroads and, even within a very selective distribution, is progressively gaining awareness, share and ranking.","adidas also increased in the quarter, supported by strong momentum in the emerging markets such as Brazil, China, Middle East, Southeast Asia and South Africa. The get ready! line celebrating Brazil World Cup was launched in this quarter and, so far is performing well and in line with our expectation.","We are also excited to announce that we have signed an agreement with UEFA soccer association to sponsor the upcoming Champions League, the most important soccer cup competition in the world, which will give us the opportunity to develop strong initiatives starting next fall. These [indiscernible] of adidas growth, including the acceleration of emerging market penetration, the initiative related to mega sport events and the extensions in new category, such as male shampoo and male skin care in emerging countries, should keep nourishing the brand growth going forward.","Let's turn to our region by region. In EMEA, sales increased 8% like-for-like. We saw strong growth in developed countries, nurtured by signs of market recovery in certain Western European countries, as well as by lower comp as a result of last year [indiscernible]. Emerging markets in the region also experienced solid growth, supported by our new structure in the Middle East and South Africa.","In the Americas, our net revenue declined 9% like-for-like. As previously discussed, our U.S. business remained under pressure, primarily as a result of weakness in the mass channel in nail. On the other hand, we reported double-digit growth in Latin America.","In Asia-Pacific, our business grew 19% like-for-like in the quarter, driven by momentum in South East Asia and Australia. In China, we grew mid-single digit in the quarter, driven by strong performance of our prestige fragrances, Lancaster skin and sun care and adidas.","On the other side, TJoy performance remains far below our expectations. The execution of the brand Revamp Flame, developed by the new management, is not yielding expected results. The TJoy underperformance is currently a drag to the profitability of our China operations and the overall Skin & Body Care segment. We are currently working on scenarios to reorganize our overall mass business in China, with objective of bringing significant benefit to the profitability of Coty China and to the overall Skin & Body Care segment. We expect to be ready to disclose our action plans by the next earning release.","As we have continued to [indiscernible], expanding our presence in the emerging markets remains a top strategy for the company. With new joint ventures and subsidiary now in place in key markets such as the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Brazil and South Africa, I'm proud to report that our emerging market revenue accelerated to 15% growth in the quarter from 7% growth in the first half.","As part of our emerging market strategy, I'm also happy to announce that on May 14, Coty and Avon signed a formal distribution agreement to distribute Coty's celebrity and lifestyle fragrances in Brazil, which is the #1 fragrance market globally. The agreement will allow us to leverage Avon's substantial force of 1.5 million Brazilian sales representatives. At this stage, we expect our brands to start to be included in Avon product catalogs in time for the 2014 Christmas holiday season.","As part of our strategy to fuel growth in the business, we remain committed to investing behind our power brands. During the quarter, advertising and promotional spending grew 140 basis points as a percentage of net revenues. We continue to invest into our new emerging markets organization. To fuel those activities, we are applying a strong discipline to our cost structure in the developed markets and keep improving cost of goods, thanks to our Productivity Program.","During the quarter, we report a strong 29% adjusted earnings per share growth to $0.22. This growth includes $14 million increase in onetime tax benefits. And our strong focus on cash flow generation has driven $248 million in free cash year-to-date, up 38% versus the prior year.","Turning now to the near-term outlook. Market conditions remain challenging in certain product segments and in certain markets, and particularly, in the U.S. mass market. Despite this, we remain focused on continuing our growth momentum through the remainder of calendar year 2014.","In light of the uncertainty on market dynamics and a more challenging comparison versus last year growth, we are anticipating fourth quarter revenues overall in line with last year. And from there, we are targeting an acceleration of growth in the first half of fiscal year '15, driven by a strong innovation plan in most of our power brands, an increase of our marketing spending to support growth and innovation and the continuous momentum in our emerging markets.","About the digital initiative in Fragrances in the first half of fiscal year 2015, we will count on the launch of new products for Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs and Chloe in the prestige channel and the launch of the new Enrique Iglesias lifestyle fragrance in mass, which should resonate particularly well with Latin consumers.","In Color, on top of the new Miracle Gel technology on Sally Hansen, we have a very competitive plan on Rimmel to keep fueling its outstanding growth.","In Skin & Body Care, we will launch the new Champions League product initiative on adidas and a new anti-aging franchise on philosophy called Nothing to Hide.","In summary, as anticipated, we returned to revenue growth in Q3 as we executed against our 3 strategic objectives. We saw strong momentum in the emerging markets, supported by the infrastructure we have put in place over the last year. We invested behind our power brands by increasing our marketing spend. And this, coupled with a strong innovation pipeline, drove revenue growth in most of our power brands.","We continue to believe that this 3-pronged strategy will help us to accelerate our growth in first half of next fiscal year to approach our long-term target of growing revenue in line with or better than the markets and the segment where we compete.","In the meantime, we will continue to identify further areas for improvement in our cost structure, and focus on gaining further efficiencies in working capital in order to drive strong free cash flow generation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Patrice, who will walk you through the key financial for the quarter.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. First, let me start by saying I'm very excited to join the Coty team and be here with you to discuss our quarterly results.","I would like to remind all of you that my commentary today on our results and outlook includes a discussion of adjusted results, which exclude the impact of nonrecurring items, including private company share-based compensation and restructuring costs. When applicable, I will also discuss our adjusted results at constant currency. This presentation is consistent with how we plan to report results and provide our outlook in future quarters. You can find the bridge from reported to adjusted results, including foreign exchange translation impact, in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","In the third quarter, our net revenue grew 2% on a like-for-like basis. As you heard earlier from Michele, this was a result of accelerated growth in the emerging markets; leveraging Coty's new joint ventures and subsidiaries; strong momentum in most of our power brands, supported by strong innovation and marketing support; and somewhat easier comparison in the prestige business versus last year. This revenue growth came in the context of a weak market condition in the U.S. and moderately improving market conditions in Europe.","It is worth noting that foreign currency had a negligible impact on our top line during the third quarter and year-to-date. Within our power brands, we saw growth in Calvin Klein, Davidoff, Marc Jacobs, Playboy, Rimmel, adidas and philosophy. Calvin Klein, Davidoff, Rimmel and adidas performed particularly well in the emerging market, speaking to the global appeal of our power brands and the benefits of our balanced prestige and mass portfolio.","In total, emerging markets grew 15% during the quarter, accelerating from the 7% growth in the first half of the year.","In the third quarter, we have recorded a noncash impairment charge of $316.9 million in the Skin & Body Care segment. As Michele discussed, this reflects the challenge we continue to face in China on the TJoy brand, despite efforts to reorganize the brand's management team and introduce new product innovation, resulting in an overall decline of the fair value of that business unit, which triggered the need for an impairment analysis for the quarter. This led us to record a $256.4 million reduction in the segment goodwill, a $54.5 million reduction in trademark and customer relationship; and a $6 million reduction in property, plant and equipment. It is worth noting that following this impairment, there will be no further intangible assets remaining on the balance sheet related to the mass and Skin & Body Care reporting units or the TJoy brand. The impairment action should drive -- improve ongoing profitability for the Skin & Body Care segment, as we benefit from an annual $8.3 million reduction in amortization expenses.","Overall, we are actively evaluating a number of different options to optimize our China mass business and mitigate the drag on our Skin & Body Care profitability, and expect to share our action plan by the next earnings call.","Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter slightly decreased by 10 basis points to 61.6%. Higher discounts and allowance needed to compete in the highly promotional market, particularly in the mass channel, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange, were largely offset by productivity gains in our supply chain.","Our reported operating income decreased to an operating loss of $272 million from $30.1 million profit in the prior year, primarily driven by the $316.9 million of impairment charge.","Reported net income decreased to a loss of $253.3 million from $20.4 million profit in the prior year, primarily driven by lower operating income as a result of the asset impairment charge, partially offset by a $14.3 million increase in income tax benefit during this quarter.","On an adjusted basis, operating income declined 22% to $81.4 million. As a percentage of net revenues, the adjusted operating margin decreased 230 basis points to 8.1% from 10.4% in the previous quarter -- in quarter of 2013. This margin decline is primarily the result of 140 basis point increase in advertising and promotion spending as a percentage of net revenues to support our brands and increasing emerging markets investments, in line with our strategy and commitment to long-term growth.","As far as cost-containment measures are concerned, we are proceeding as planned with our Productivity Program. We continue to expect to see annual savings of over $25 million by the end of this fiscal year, reaching $45 million in savings by the end of fiscal 2015 and $60 million by the end of fiscal 2016. To further build on this momentum, we are currently evaluating our operating model to identify additional areas for simplification and standardization.","Let us now look at our performance by segment. Fragrances revenue grew 6% like-for-like, including 7% volume growth, partially offset by negative 1% price mix. The negative price mix reflected a higher proportion of mass and masstige fragrance this quarter. Adjusted operating income for Fragrances decreased 2% to $54.3 million, while the adjusted operating margin declined 70 basis points to 10.7%. This decline reflects lower gross margin, in part, reflecting negative foreign exchange, the negative impact of ceased activities in the prior year and some portfolio mix shift, as well as investment in emerging markets.","In Color Cosmetics, revenue declined 6% like-for-like, with a 5% volume decline coupled with a negative 1% price mix. Adjusted operating income decreased to $36.7 million, with the operating margin down 310 basis points to 10.6%. While maintaining the gross margin for the segment at the same level despite the sales decline, we meaningfully ramped up marketing support to the segment to regain traction in the coming quarters.","For the Skin & Body Care segment, revenues grew 8% like-for-like, including 4% volume growth and 4% positive price mix. The positive price mix reflected a mix shift in the quarter toward prestige brands, philosophy and Lancaster. Adjusted operating loss for the segment increased to $9.6 million from $2.2 million in the prior year, as we have ramped up advertising and promotion spending behind the brand to accelerate the momentum of the segment. Going forward, our operating income in the segment should benefit from the $8.3 million reduction in annual amortization expenses following the recent asset impairment.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was negative 40.9% compared to 6.9% in the prior period. This was due to a one-off recognition of tax benefits upon settlement of certain foreign audits totaling $38.1 million compared to a onetime tax benefit of $23.8 million in the prior period related to the extension of 954(6)(c) resulting in a $14.3 million increase in onetime tax benefits. The settlement of the foreign audits should also provide an ongoing incremental benefit to our book tax rate of approximately 100 basis points.","As the results of the above, our adjusted net income increased by 27% to $86.7 million. This drove adjusted EPS of $0.22, up from $0.17 in the prior period. Net cash used by operating activities totaled $4.2 million in the quarter, and was a source of cash of $443.1 million in the last 9 months. And after capital expenditure, our free cash flow was $247.9 million in the last 9 months.","Let me now offer an update of our SAP rollout, which has contributed to our continued operating efficiencies. We advanced our SAP rollout program with the April 1 launch of SAP in our largest manufacturing plant located in Sanford, North Carolina. The system and process ramp up period is underway and we continue to focus on changed management throughout the facility. With this implementation, we plan to exit fiscal year 2014 with over 70% SAP global coverage in both commercial and manufacturing. The SAP rollout program is expected to continue in fiscal 2015.","Finally, we have been actively deploying capital in the public markets as part of the $200 million share repurchase program we announced in our last earnings call. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares of our Class A common stock for $67.6 million. And I'm pleased to say that the total amount of cash deployed for repurchases to date has reached $100 million. We believe this speaks to our commitment to driving shareholder value and our view on the value we continue to see in our shares.","With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can I just ask you one question? This is a housekeeping question, a real question. What do you think the tax rate is going to be for the fourth quarter? And then that $8.3 million of amortization that's going away, is that pre or post tax? And am I right to say that it doesn't have any impact on cash flow, so it comes out both sides?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","So, Bill, thanks for your question. So on the second part of the question, the $8.3 million is pretax. As far as the fourth quarter and the full year guidance, so we don't modify our current guidance, which is that the effective tax rate should be in the range of 25% to 28% going forward.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then when you think about what's going on in the mass channel, can you give us a name -- work to figure out why the decline has been so substantial in such a short period of time? I know there's some destocking, but even if you look at some of the sell-through numbers in Nielsen, it looks equally bad. So do you guys have any sort of conclusions as to why it happened so abruptly and then maybe what it is going to take to get it to accelerate again?","Michele Scannavini","Bill, this is a 1 million question and we have debated about that several times with you and we've updated on the industry. Clearly, there are some explanation that relate to some, let me say external impending like extreme weather condition that had impacted clearly the beginning of quarter 3, particularly January and February. But we have seen the slowdown coming even before and we remember perfectly well that the Christmas season in the mass channel has been particularly soft. It looks like the low-income consumer are purchasing less. They are going less in the store. And to [indiscernible] this, the environment is very promotional. And this is something that we see clearly in the United States, but alternatively, we have seen this phenomenon also in Europe. Now on the positive side, let's say, in Europe, we start seeing some sign of improvement, particularly in Central Europe. I've not seen yet sign of improvement in the U.S. Now how this can change? Difficult to say. How we can contribute to try to change this is try to bring innovation, the [indiscernible] and exciting to the market and increase our investment behind our brand, hoping in this way to create more traffic and more purchase. But I was following very, very attentively carefully all the release of all the player in the mass market and I can say that although everybody is in agreement that there has been this strong slowdown, twice relate 1 specific reason why is very difficult.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As we look at the TJoy write-down sort of contrasted by the philosophy results, your skin care business seems to be heading a little bit in 2 different directions, and there has been some discussion in the market in terms of your willingness to go out and potentially do an acquisition in skin care going forward. So can you talk about where this divergence in performance leaves you in terms of looking at your skin care portfolio and whether you should be adding to it? Is it a sector where you need to raise your focus? And then sort of going along with that, as you look at the change in your outlook on TJoy, you had talked about using that as a distribution platform for other products. Has the write-down or the need for the write-down, rather, led you to any sort of different decision in terms of whether or not that's possible going forward?","Michele Scannavini","Okay. So let's start with the first part of the question that is explaining a bit our skin care dynamic and let me say, there are 2 different dynamics. So when you look at our business and our portfolio, I must say that actually, the vast majority of our portfolio now is tuned in a positive direction. Start talking about philosophy, we have discussed several times the issue that we face at the beginning. And basically, we relate it to 2 main things. The fact that we have to delay our informational development because of the time required to reformulate products and to register in new countries this product and the low impact of the innovation plan. Now we work intensively on both and we see that the situation now in philosophy is getting progressively better up to the point that now we have 4 quarters in a row of growth that is both in United States and in international markets. So I think that through the period, we also strengthen our capabilities, we brought a new management team in the philosophy team with strong expertise of skin care. And apart from philosophy, I would say that this is an important step overall for our ability to manage successfully the skin care segment. Then we have Lancaster. That is a smaller brand, very strong in Sun, that is developing actually very, very nicely in China, particularly in the Sun segment. And then we have adidas that as we discussed before, supported by development in emerging market and this media sports event is also having a positive growth. So in this context that is rather positive, we have the exception of TJoy. Now the difference is clearly due to the fact that, as you know, with TJoy, we had some issues in finding a management team that was competent, loyal and reliable. In the meantime, the brand lost momentum and the activity that we try to do in the brand so far didn't pay out. We also have to say that the stage at TJoy is a very small brand in the very, very big, competitive mass market in China. So it's particularly difficult to have a grip with consumer why we don't have critical mass enough to have a big impact on the market. So I should say that all in all, as we discussed a few times, we are on a learning curve on our management of the Skin & Body Care category that basically we have created 2, 3 years ago. I must say that all in all, the signs are positive. The, let me say, trend is positive. We need just to fix the TJoy issue that I was mentioning before, we will look into alternative to fix it and to benefit the total Skin & Body Care category profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Bank of America.","Olivia Tong - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","First, I just want to follow up on the TJoy question. So I guess, what sort of your plan going forward? And in terms of priorities, where does Chinese mass skin care fall? And then the real question I want to ask is with half the June quarter now in the books, can you talk about what you're seeing now as the weather has turned in the U.S.? It sounds like mass is still sluggish, but it also sounds like some of your competitors are seeing some green shoots in prestige overall, so just curious on what you're thinking in terms of that.","Michele Scannavini","Okay. First question on China. So let me remind a bit what is our business in China today. So the biggest part of our business in China is prestige business, specifically prestige fragrances that as of today is more than 50% of our business in China. This part of the business is growing very nicely, both in terms of revenues and in terms of profit. And we see that we're going from strength to strength with our brand, particularly Calvin Klein, which is the #3 brand in the market; Chloe; Marc Jacobs; and other brands of our portfolio. So this is a very healthy, growing part to our business in China. Then we have Skin Care: Lancaster and adidas, both are growing very nicely. adidas in the last quarter had a stronger double-digit growth. So also there, we see a dynamic that is positive. Then, we have TJoy where the real issue is. Now as I said before, we are not ready yet to talk about our plan on how we are going to reorganize our business in the mass market -- mass channel in China, but it's important for everybody to remember that the vast majority of our business in China is doing well. And actually, as I said before, in the quarter, we had a mid- to single-digit increase despite a very poor performance of TJoy. In terms of the trend, the market trend in U.S., so what we have seen in the quarter 3, at least in the segment where we compete, a situation which mass was difficult and see declining, but even the prestige business, in this case, particularly prestige fragrances was, overall, flat when adjust for the calendar shift. You know that this year is counted 1 week less than last year, but when you try to put a number like-to-like -- like-for-like, sorry, it's overall flat. So it's not an empty situation in prestige as well. I have no visibility on April number yet, so I cannot say if the trend is continuing in April. But all in all, the situation in U.S. market in that moment is rather static, if not declining.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the Avon deal and then on A&P. So I guess first on Avon, can you just confirm what the structure of the deal is, like will you be manufacturing fragrance in the market through the same third-party manufacturer you had been using and then booking revenue on your sales to Avon? And then the second question is on A&P. This 140-basis-point increase, can you talk a little bit about where you are on A&P spend relative to where you want to be? Do you think the company is spending at appropriate levels? And is this a shift from promo, like how do think that line will trend as we move into fiscal '15?","Michele Scannavini","Okay. Let's start with Avon now. So first of all, I want to restate that I'm very happy and excited about this deal because I believe it's going to really give us now a penetration with our fragrances in the most important market in the world for Fragrances. So we see this as a very important deal for our business in the future. Said that, the structure is a distribution agreement. So Avon will distribute and sell through their beauty representatives our product, and we will manufacture product through third-party manufacturer locally. Because obviously, to be competitive in the market, you need to have a local production. So we are going to have this scheme and we can say it's a very normal distribution agreement. As far as A&P, we are planning to increase our investments. As you might remember, we said that we have been historically between 23% and 24% of our investment. We are planning the progress to grow to a higher part of this gap -- and so of this interval, sorry, because we see that the market is very competitive. And particularly, when the market trend is a little bit soft, as you have seen in the last month, particularly in the consolidated country -- in the developed countries, it is important to put fuel behind your power brand. So we are -- so the fact that we see increase in return of investment in this quarter is not an exception. It's going to be a trend that we will see for the future because we believe in the potential of our brand. But we need to be sure that we have enough investment to stand out in a very competitive and crowded environment. On top of that, obviously, our increased penetration in the emerging markets where I think we're well positioned with our brands, we will increase investments to support our brands. So all in all, we have defined clearly and strategically that we need to invest more behind our brand in order to ensure to get sooner to our long-term growth objective of growing in line or faster than the market in segments where we compete.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga of Piper Jaffray.","Neely J.N. Tamminga - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Can we talk a little bit out the nail category? And maybe this is revisiting, I guess, the core of Bill's question around mass. If we were to kind of look at nail as being a little bit of a microcosm across the broader distribution networks, you've got mass all the way up to prestige. What are you seeing within the nail category as it relates to the mass versus prestige? Said another way, is OPI actually more stable or even positive and Sally Hansen just hasn't caught up to that innovation level yet or is OPI actually still negative and Sally Hansen just more negative?","Michele Scannavini","Okay. Okay. So talking about the nail category, trying to clarify a bit the different segment of our nail category. So first of all, it's important to understand that we see a very strong declining trend today in the U.S., it's not the case in the rest of the world. So in Europe, for instance, the nail segment is still growing high single digit. So it's really today North America and specifically U.S. phenomena. Number two, when you look at the overall nail business, the vast, vast, vast majority to the business is mass. So clearly, the impact on the total nail segment is driven very strongly by the trend in the mass channel. And when the trend in the mass channel is bad, total nail segment is suffering. Now referring to OPI. Again, OPI in Europe has a distribution that is professional and start having some foreseeable distribution is doing very nicely. It's growing and is going from strength to strength. In U.S., OPI is mostly distributed in salon. And the salon business, let me say, is overall around flattish. With nail, that is suffering a bit also. Not as much as we see in a retail, but I believe that one of the cause that I was mentioning related to the decline of the category that is a huge in-house inventory of nail product in -- by consumer in the United States is impacting, maybe not the service part on the salon but for sure, the selling -- product selling part of the salon as well. So also salon -- nail salon category, we see a decline not strong as we see in the retail environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of B. -- Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of things. First, on the SAP initiative, have you quantified what benefits you think you'll see from that either on the income statement or the balance sheet and over what time frame?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","So in terms of SAP rollout, clearly, this is helping us in driving efficiencies. So this is something that will bring some more standardized and simplified ways of operating and will help us in our Productivity Program. So this is embedded into the Productivity Program, and this is an enabler for the Productivity Program to happen.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. Okay. Terrific. And then on the share repo, the $100 million that's happened faster than I would have expected, is there a plan to re-up the authorization? I mean, it sounds like you're halfway done already. Do you have kind of longer-term plan or an annual target in terms of the number or amount of shares you want to buy back?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","So on this one, as you know, so the board has approved a $200 million program. So we have already executed the first $100 million, so there is no reason why we'll not pursue the second portion of this approved $200 million program. And we will revisit going forward on a regular basis, what is the best way for us to return cash to shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about M&A, just to get some updated thoughts on your views of acquiring scale versus going after new categories and geographies. And then just a second sort of follow-up to some of the other questions around A&P spend. Could you talk maybe a bit about any change in how you're managing mass versus prestige brand spend, given what we're seeing from a divergence and category growth and just sort of how you're thinking about it? So incremental spend, but is it in a different way than you envisioned maybe 6 or 12 months ago?","Michele Scannavini","Okay. So first part on our M&A strategy. So we are looking for deals that can have a strategic fit with our growth objective and that are financial accretive. This is the important things to keep in mind. As you know, as we have discussed, our growth roadmap include to get a stronger -- even a stronger leadership in the segment where we are already covering a good position like fragrance and color. And to strengthen the scope of our business in skin care. We are looking to -- for targets that can give a significant contribution to strengthen our competitive position, adding certain segment or in certain areas, particularly in emerging markets. But one thing that is important is that we want to see something that's on top of being strategically right are financial accretive for us. In terms of A&P, so we are really driving our A&P decision based on the strategy that we have for our power brands. So it's not very much driven by the -- let me say, short-term strengths of the channel. It's more driven by what is our assumption in growth potential related to our power brands. For instance, just to be specific, when we look at fragrance, clearly, we have a stronger business in more power brands in prestige. So we are going to invest more in brand in that prestige channel than in mass. When we look at the color segment, our power brands are in mass, particularly Rimmel and Sally Hansen and OPI is in professional. And because of this, we will invest more in mass than in prestige. So again, it is driven by growth potential related to our power brands.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a question now and it comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser of B. Riley.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - B. Riley Caris, Research Division","Can you give just a little bit more color on the agreement with Avon in terms of the distribution of the Fragrances in Brazil. Specifically, I think you have some other agreements, joint ventures and agreements with other distribution partners in the market. So how will you kind of divide up the brands? Are certain brands going to be distributed through Avon and other ones through other channels or exactly what are the details of the distribution?","Michele Scannavini","Yes, thanks then for the question, because given the opportunity to clarify what is going to be going forward our situation in Brazil. So as of today, we have a joint venture with Frajo that is the company owned by Boticario that take care of distributing and selling our brands in the retail brick-and-mortar mass environment. And here, we are going to progressively distribute all our brands in the different categories. Then we have now this agreement with Avon door-to-door. As you may remember, we have, today, an agreement with another door-to-door company that is called Jequiti. This agreement will expire in the moment in which we are going to start working with Avon. So Avon will have the exclusivity of distributing our door-to-door -- our fragrance brand door-to-door. Then the fragrance brand that we will distribute door-to-door or -- to better say, the fragrance product will be exclusive to door-to-door. That means that we're going to have also some fragrances that will be distributed in the brick-and-mortar, but will not be the same. So we will avoid to have the same SKU, the same product in the 2 channels. Is it clear?","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call.

You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Camillo.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's second quarter conference call. I'm delighted to be here speaking with you leading my first earnings call as Coty's CEO.","Let me take a moment to reiterate for you Coty's ambition, as previously articulated by Bart, which I embrace and will continue to use as the foundation of my strategic vision. Our ambition in beauty is to strive to become over time a global industry leader by being a clear challenger in beauty, delighting our consumers, which ultimately should translate into revenue growth, strong cash flow and the creation of long-term shareholder value.","Having completed my first four months in the role, it's clear to me that the combination of our iconic and emerging brands, energized employees and the comprehensive strategy we are laying out for the new organization, will position us well to reach our ambition. Today is our first time reporting as a combined company following the closing of the P&G Beauty transaction October 1. Consistent with our comments on the last earnings call, Q2 was a challenging quarter. The business was impacted by significantly higher-than-anticipated inventory levels in the market, on the acquired P&G Beauty Business, competitive pressure in the Consumer Beauty division, and the distraction associated with the integration efforts.","I want to be clear that while the complexity of the merger, the sheer magnitude of this integration and simultaneous reorganization of our total company have impacted our organization and our short-term results, I have initiated additional changes as I'm not satisfied with the underlying performance of several parts of the business. So although fiscal 2017 is a transitional year, as previously discussed, we have already started to tackle the growth challenges of our business.","As it is my first earnings call and an introduction to how I think about the business, I wanted to go in much more detail into the trends and strategies that I plan going forward. To reiterate my assessment from the last earnings call, the Coty business is composed of three divisions in different states of evolution. The Professional Beauty division is performing well overall, fueled by the continued success of the hair portfolio. The Luxury division has been improving its revenue trends in parallel with decreasing wholesale distribution to create a healthy business. And we expect the momentum to continue in the coming quarters. However, the Consumer Beauty division is facing a number of challenges, and I'll come back to Consumer Beauty in more detail later.","I will now discuss my strategic vision for the company and the specific actions we are implementing to continue the reshaping of our business in order to address the current challenges and return the combined company to growth. First and foremost, we have an amazing portfolio of iconic brands that are loved by millions of consumers throughout the world, including COVERGIRL, Rimmel and Clairol in Consumer Beauty; Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and Gucci in Luxury; and Wella and OPI in Professional Beauty.","Our first focus on our established global brands is to continue to strengthen and nurture them, particularly as some of them were previously essentially orphaned within a larger corporation. Our second focus is to cultivating (05:03) few of the brands with higher growth potential in our portfolio. Our third focus is to stabilize the remaining brands, whether through active portfolio rationalization or other majors. Finally, we're also completing the shaping of our new organization, including making sure we have the right talent in key roles to drive growth in our brands.","We aim to achieve these objectives through four key pillars. First, we are repositioning some of the brands in order to reconnect these brands with consumers, building on their already strong brand equity. Second, we are making significant changes to our innovation and product development process in parts of the organization. Third, we are accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation, including e-commerce. And fourth, we are working to significantly ramp our in-store execution.","I would like to also highlight that we see a substantial opportunity to use the strength of our growth portfolio brands to reach more and more consumers all over the world, as many of our brands still have substantial opportunity for geographical expansion leveraging our global distribution footprint.","On the M&A front, we're continuing to strengthen the Coty portfolio through highly strategic acquisitions and planned portfolio rationalization. Both ghd and Younique are expected to be accretive in year one, on both net revenue growth and adjusted earnings. From a strategic perspective, ghd expands our assortment of premium products for the Salon channel, while the partnership with Younique leverages unique high-growth e-commerce platform and social selling direct-to-consumer business model.","On the portfolio rationalization, we have identified the non-core portfolio brands and are now exploring potential alternatives for these brands, including divestitures. So the comprehensive reshaping of our business for growth is continuing at pace.","I would now like to take some time to discuss each of Coty's new divisions and the specific action we are implementing to address current challenges and return the combined company to growth.","I'll start with Consumer Beauty. This division represents approximately half of our combined portfolio in our revenues with around half of the division sales concentrated in color cosmetics, and the other half composed of retail hair, body care and mass fragrances. The Q2 results of the Consumer Beauty division were clearly disappointing, as I mentioned before. The main drivers behind these results are the fact that some of the key brands were orphaned in the previous large organization, the high competitive market pressure, and the changing market environment. Additionally, we're still working through highly elevated (08:08) trade inventories that were built before the close of the P&G Beauty transaction.","So let me go a little deeper into each of these categories, starting with color cosmetics. The color cosmetics category has been growing at an average at a low-single digit pace in key regions. But the category has been rapidly changing with consumers' focus much more on trends in ancillary products, and engaging much more online to discuss and determine what they purchase. A lot of the growth has come from entry (08:44) and smaller brands that are fast to respond to trends and engage with their customers through digital platforms and innovative in-store activation. We are behind on this curve, but we have already taken action and we are working on a multi-pronged approach.","First, we are revamping our product development, as well as our communication process and programs. Aided by our own digital agency, Beamly, as well as more strategic partnership with our key partner suppliers, the new innovation process is focused on spotting the trends early and slashing our average time to market, which is currently about 12, 18 months. In parallel, we are working to digitally transform our brands and overall our in-store presence to make sure we're present the best way possible where our consumers shop. As part of these efforts, we will be shifting more money from traditional media to digital media and investment in the store. Finally, we are also working with retailers to improve our partnership relationship, bringing value to them and their customers.","From a brand perspective, we believe we have a strong portfolio of cosmetic brands, but we'll be re-launching several of them to regain relevance with consumers. Specifically, we will be re-launching COVERGIRL and Max Factor in the coming fiscal year, with new brand positioning, new creations, new packaging and new in-store appearance. We will also be announcing Sally Hansen's market approach to build a stronger emotional connection with the consumer.","While the full COVERGIRL and Max Factor brand re-launches will kick off in few quarters, we're already seeing some bright spots in the business. COVERGIRL So Lashy! launch is the biggest mascara launch of the season. The innovative (10:35) product, strong consumer insight and the disruptive marketing campaign featuring James Charles and Nura Afia have driven disproportion engagement and above expected results for this novel mascara that works for all lash types. This multi-pronged approach will take time to yield results, but we strongly believe this is the right way to strengthen our business for the long term.","Turning to retail hair, we believe that Coty has a real opportunity to revive the category through innovation, stronger in-store execution and consumer engagement. The category has been dormant for the last 10 years, particularly in developed countries. We believe the biggest players in the category, including Clairol, have been leveraging the category for profit with no real innovation. Our analysis indicates that consumers are intimidated by the difficulty of the shopping for hair color in stores and the complexity of the hair coloring process at home.","In turn, the category penetration has been going down, as consumers would rather go to their professional stylist. As a result of these category issues, retailers have been progressively capping the shelf allocation, which in turn has limited the color assortment, preventing many women from finding their shade. Against this backdrop, we believe we have an exciting pipeline of innovation in the near future that will revitalize the retail hair category and transform it into a beauty category instead of a functional category. The Consumer Beauty division will take some time to return to growth, and I'm confident the strategic action that we are putting in place are the right steps to strengthen Coty's position in this beauty category.","Turning to the Luxury division, which accounts for approximately a third of the combined company revenues, we believe we have a very strong portfolio of brands, which span the spectrum of the prestige fragrance category from low premium to ultra-premium. And we are continuing with our strategy of making our portfolio even more prestige. Coty Luxury had strong results across several of our brands and pillars in Q2. However, the division performance in Q2 versus last year was impacted by our continued wholesale distribution reduction, which is a positive for the health of the business, and by the difficult innovation comparison versus the previous year.","On the positive side, we launched the new Hugo Boss fragrance, The Scent For Her, which marked the brand's successful entry into the female category. This was the number one launch in the UK and number two in Spain. The feedback for the new Gucci Guilty marketing campaign has also been very positive, driving market share growth in the Gucci Guilty franchise in both the U.S. and Italy. The core brand continued to grow in market across all key countries, supported by the Flora de Parfum launch.","philosophy also continued to grow in the quarter, fueled by its direct-to-consumer platform. From a go-to-market perspective, we are continuing to gain share in the travel retail channel where we already have a disproportionate share of the fragrance category. We evolved to successfully establish a local affiliate in China, steadily improving our distribution in in-market performance. So, as we look to the second half of 2017, we remain excited by the robust pipeline of initiatives across the Hugo Boss, Gucci and Calvin Klein brands, amongst others. And while there is more to do on wholesale distribution, we do expect revenue trends in the Luxury division to continue to improve in the coming quarters.","In the Professional Beauty division, which accounts for approximately a fifth of combined company revenues, we're maintaining strong momentum in the hair category, while broadening our portfolio with ghd within hair appliances and a critical adjacency in nail with OPI.","Our Salon hair portfolio continued to grow low to mid-single-digit, consistent with the performance in the two previous fiscal years, and ahead of the salon market, which is growing at approximately 1%. We are excited by the continued strong performance over the largest brand, Wella, as well as the System Professional brand which is tapping into the premium care segment and the growing trends of customization and personalization with this EnergyCode technology.","ghd, as the new key brand of the Professional Beauty portfolio, has performed well in its first few weeks within Coty. And we expect momentum to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, notably building on its geographical footprint expansion beyond its core countries. All together, we expect the Professional Beauty division to see good growth on a combined company basis through the rest of the fiscal 2017 and beyond.","Following on the heels of the ghd acquisition, I'm excited about our partnership with Younique. I'm extremely pleased that both of the founders, Derek and Melanie, will continue to lead the business, which leverages the exponential potential of online peer-to-peer social selling. The partnership will combine Younique's high growth e-commerce platform with Coty R&D and innovation know-how, as well as extensive manufacturing supply chain capabilities.","And speaking of digitally focused investments, I would like to touch on the substantial effort that we're implementing to accelerate Coty's digital transformation. These actions span four major components. In marketing science, we are now able to understand and reach our consumers with far higher levels of targeting precision, thereby enabling a step change in our social listening and trend scanning capabilities to better keep our brand teams in markets.","In terms of brand content, we are testing creative to better align with target consumer segments and drive high and low (16:55) media effectiveness. In media optimization, we have continued the transition to digital from 21% to over 30% globally in just this past six months, while also outperforming engagement and cost benchmarks by up to 30%, driving further media efficiency. Looking at it as omnichannel (17:18), we will begin to create new platforms for deeper personalization, including online and new store activation programs.","With regards to the rest of fiscal 2017, we continue to expect the decline of the net revenue at constant currency to slow down in the second half, excluding the contribution from Younique and ghd. On the P&G Beauty Business merger, the integration is progressing as expected, with no major issues to-date. And we are reiterating our previously communicated $750 million synergy target by fiscal 2020.","If I can summarize, fiscal 2017 remains a challenging transitional year, but one that we believe is setting the stage for enormous potential as a global leader and challenger in beauty. I believe the new Coty is a much stronger company than the two previous organizations running separately, and now that we have full control of the combined brand portfolio, I'm even more confident about the great long-term potential of the new Coty.","I will now turn it over to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Camillo, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to report our results for the first time as the new Coty team is completing the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business on October 1. Coty today is a new company, one that we have built on a bottom-up approach into a new focused divisional organization and combines the expertise and talents of executives from Coty, P&G Beauty Business and other leading properties (18:57). Building the new organization bottom-up best positions the company to advance Coty's global leadership position in beauty and also provides the opportunity to drive substantial synergies.","We have created three new operating divisions and therefore three new reporting segments, which are Consumer Beauty, Luxury and Professional Beauty. This new organization structure is product-category and channel-focused, putting the consumer first by specifically targeting how and where they shop and what and why they purchase. Each of the divisions have full end-to-end responsibility to optimize the consumer's beauty experience in their relevant categories and channels. We are convinced this new organizational design with full P&L responsibility will translate into profitable growth.","The Reverse Morris Trust carve-out measure with the P&G Beauty business was and still is an enormously complex and challenging transaction globally. It is the largest beauty deal in history and the largest global RMT merger to be successfully completed in the consumer sector.","First, from a carve-out standpoint, we continue to integrate worldwide P&G Beauty business with the worldwide Legacy-Coty business from a systems and manufacturing perspective, which are currently operating under TSAs or transitional service agreements.","Turning now to the current integration efforts, our teams are working full speed to pave the way for a smooth integration and are doing an extraordinary job on a day-to-day basis. As a result, it is progressing as expected with no major issues to-date. We are now in the process of preparing for the first stage exit from the TSA in North America, which should happen in the quarter of April. It is worth noting that this first wave of TSA exit is expected to provide some modest uplift for a pull-forward of shipments to Q3. Europe should follow in the course of July with then EMEA in September. This provides some additional context for why we have described fiscal 2017 as a transitional year for Coty.","Now let me provide some of the highlights for the second quarter. Q2 net revenues of $2.3 billion increased 90% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty, and decreased 4% at constant currency compared to combined Coty and P&G Beauty business net revenues in the prior year period. Our performance has been severely impacted by the negative transitional issues, especially including significant trade inventory build in Q1 in part of the P&G business, costing more than three points of growth. Excluding these transitional issues and the positive contribution from ghd and Hypermarcas, the combined company net revenues at constant currency declined in the high-single digits and were slightly better than the outlook provided on the last earnings call.","By division, Professional Beauty net revenues grew 14% at constant currency compared to combined company revenues in the prior year or low-single digit excluding the contribution from ghd. Luxury net revenues declined 4% at constant currency compared to combined company revenues in the prior year. Consumer Beauty net revenues declined 11% at constant currency compared to combined company revenues in the prior year. These declines reflected a high-single digit percentage negative impact from the transition issues discussed earlier, largely offset by the revenue contribution from the Brazil acquisition. The in-market performance sell-through of the division was better with a high-single digit decline.","Let us now go into the shape of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 63.6% increased from 61.4% for Legacy-Coty in the prior period, as we're adding a higher gross margin business from P&G. The Q2 adjusted operating income increased 44% to $336 million on a constant currency basis from $233 million from Legacy-Coty in the prior year period.","The adjusted operating margin decreased to 14.3% at constant rate from 19.3% for Legacy-Coty, mainly driven by two key components. First, we had negative operating income impact of over 200 basis points from the transitional issues due to the merger. Second, we added the P&G Beauty Business, which carried limited operating margin as a result of substantial A&CP pre-commitments, which we could not reduce to align with the revenue trends, combined with a depressed dynamic within Consumer Beauty business.","From a segment perspective, Luxury reported an adjusted operating margin of 11.7%, reflecting the addition of a lower margin P&G business. Consumer Beauty posted an adjusted operating margin of 11% despite the depressed revenues, while Professional Beauty adjusted operating margin of 21.7% reflects a solid margin from our main business combined with improvement in salon hair, which also benefited from the seasonal strength in Q2. Therefore, all the above combined with a quarterly tax rate of 8.8%, reflecting an adjusted tax benefit of $39 million, we reported an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.30.","As far as the deal economics are concerned, we are free to confirm our previously communicated target of $750 million in synergies, $1.2 billion in one-time cost, $500 million in working capital benefits and $500 million in one-time CapEx by fiscal 2020. We remain committed to our previously committed adjusted EPS target of $1.53 for fiscal 2020. This being said, there are many different ways to get there, and it is fair to say we will also use our balance sheet to shape the growth profile path of the company and hit the above targets.","With regards to synergies, with the two businesses now running together allowing leadership better insight into their individual cost structures, we are refining the phasing of the targeted $750 million in synergies in order to take into account the business dynamics and to reflect the fiscal year P&L impact.","As you may recall, our primary synergy phasing estimate has always been on an annual basis, where the fiscal 2017 recognized no synergies in Q1 as the transaction did not close until October 1. We now expect to cumulatively generate approximately 20% of the net $750 million synergies through fiscal 2017, roughly 50% through fiscal 2018, approximately 80% through fiscal 2019 and the full $750 million through fiscal 2020. Our focus is on having the right infrastructure in place to support the long-term goal.","Now, let us speak about the balance sheet and our cash profile. Q2 has been a very good quarter with over $670 million in operating cash flow and $567 million in free cash flow during the quarter. This represents an increase of over $270 million in operating cash flow versus Legacy-Coty in the prior year, and is the result of a very strict cash discipline and tight working capital management quarter after quarter. This cash generation is critical in the current environment and provides strong visibility to the progress we can further realize with the combined business.","We finished the second quarter with over $900 million in cash on the balance sheet, and approximately $5.6 billion in net debt. And it is fair to say some of this cash will be used in the back half of the year while we execute the integration. Our balance sheet is very solid with a very moderate leverage after all the recent acquisitions made.","I would like to point out that we still maintain our pro forma leverage profile of roughly 3.8 times while adding ghd and Younique to our portfolio, which are meaningfully shifting the growth profile of our company. We are vastly (28:41) pleased with the profitability profile of Younique, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 25%. We expect these two significant adds will be both accretive year one from a growth and adjusted earnings standpoint, and allows us to better position to be a serious challenger in the beauty industry.","We have identified the noncore portfolio of brands, which confirms our preliminary estimate of approximately 6% to 8% of the combined portfolio revenues. We are currently assessing what the potential alternatives regarding this portfolio of brands could be, including divestitures. But this will take some time as we ensure we maximize shareholder value. We are targeting to offset any earnings dilution from this portfolio optimization with acquisitions.","We continue to drive shareholder value through an 82% increase in dividends, and transition to a quarterly dividend payout. This policy is a good reflection of the strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, and will likely remain unchanged in the short term. We also retained our remaining $400 million share buyback authorization and we will remain opportunistic, as we always have been, in the way we potentially use it. And we know we have the long-term support from our largest shareholder, JAB.","After the successful completion of the P&G Beauty Business merger, the business has shown strategic and financial flexibility and we're extremely confident in the free cash flow profile of the company and strength of the balance sheet. This will allow us to gradually shape the growth profile of the company to be well-positioned as a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Steph Wissink of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of questions, Camillo, regarding your comments on the reorganization. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the changes in role definition that have been made, and when do you expect some of that to start to play out in the controls that you're seeing within the business segments.","And then, Patrice, just as a follow-up on the $1.50+-ish target, and the commitment to use the balance sheet. Can you give us a sense of what leverage ratio you'd be comfortable going to at its peak in order to offset some of the divestiture dilution and some of the slower growth progress in the core business? Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Steph, for the question. Look, this is a big reorganization because both companies were not organized and structured this way prior to the merger. So we have created three divisions. Both Coty Legacy and P&G Beauty Business were not managed this way, so clearly having to manage now \u2013 having managing the company with three end-to-end division where they have full responsibility for the entire portfolio and the P&L, this is clearly a different way of working that has been embedded in the organization at the moment. So clearly, the way of working has changed for a lot of our people, both coming from the Coty Legacy, from P&G or from the outside.","And another key element of differentiation in the structure that we had chosen is that we have end-to-end responsibility with the division, as I said, but also that the P&L sits with the countries. And this is quite an also, I would say, significant departure from how the business was managed especially in the P&G previous business where the control of the P&L was more central, I would say. So, I don't know if I'm answering fully your question, but in my opinion this is \u2013 I would say, are the two key elements that are making this reorganization complex, but at the same time, in my opinion, paving the way for the future success of the company.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Steph, on your \u2013 the second part of your question regarding the leverage, so first I think one should remember that we are going to generate once we have all the run-off, (33:27) north of $1 billion of cash each and every year, which once again plays into the cash flow profile of the company and the strong balance sheet. Second, the leverage that we are ready to go to highly depends on the profile of the target and whether this target is very strategic or not, so I can't give you a definite answer. It highly depends on where, whether it is strategic the size of the acquisition, so it's very dependent on that. But in terms of M&A strategy, the key (34:03) which we look at it is clearly number one, a very strong strategic fit. Number two, value adding from Coty finds it attractive (34:13) our growth and earnings profile. And three, where we provide a peer (34:20) return to our shareholders. But once again, in terms of leverage, it clearly depends on the type of targets and the strategies and the size of the target.","Kevin Monaco - Coty, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I have two questions actually. The first one just has to do with the NPD and Nielsen data, and I guess it's sort of also tied to COVERGIRL because like the trends have obviously been not very good, and it seems like some of the distribution is coming out. So, when I look at the ACV on COVERGIRL, it sort of peaked at 74%, it's down to 71%, and then it looks like it's heading in the wrong direction. So wondering again, like when you guys think that the sell-through data is going to start to firm up and if you're scared about some of the distribution trends that are happening, especially at COVERGIRL. And the second one, just some further color on the timing of the synergy stuff because it looks like a lot of it got pushed forward quite a bit, so that would be appreciated. Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Bill, for the question. Look, we believe that we have an amazing set of brands and our brands are loved by millions. So our strategy in terms of repositioning the brands, and you mentioned COVERGIRL, it's not just the only one, is key to reconnect with the consumers. I mentioned that I was not satisfied with some of the elements of the COVERGIRL position in the past, but actually we are now working on reinvigorating the innovation process, upgrading the packaging, the way it looks in-store, we're going to be more modern, more focused on looks. So clearly, we have a lot in our pipeline to re-launch the brand in the future.","I have to say that we've been also exposing some of our thoughts and ideas to the retailers and actually the reaction is very positive. So going back to distribution, this is a temporary situation, but we are very, very confident that all the actions that we are going to put in place will actually allow COVERGIRL to retain the position that we want to have in the market and improve. And as a matter of fact, COVERGIRL is still the brand with the strongest equity in mass color cosmetic in the U.S., and that gives us an enormous level of confidence for the future potential of going back to growth.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, Bill, good morning. So on your question regarding the synergies and the phasing of the synergies; I think you should remember that when we quoted the synergies before, we spoke on an annual basis, not on a fiscal basis. So that plays a key role into the new phasing. And the second one is that clearly while taking into account the business dynamics and the management has much more insight now into the different cost structure. So clearly, we re-confirmed the $750 million synergies. We are very confident about it. It should be fully executed by fiscal 2020, and the phasing that now we are expecting is 20% in fiscal 2017, 50% in fiscal 2018 and 80% in fiscal 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. First on the integration, hoping you can help like sort of clarify because you're saying the integration is progressing as expected, but then obviously pushing out the timing of the realization. So I get the fiscal versus the annual, but is this also \u2013 is there anything in terms of like the initial costs that are transferring over or your ability to realize cost synergies that's playing in that in terms of the delay in realization? Because I'm a bit confused as to what gives you the confidence that you can still reach those four-year synergy and working capital targets when they're obviously getting pushed out.","And the other thing is, obviously, it doesn't assume any of the deals or an improvement in your underlying business, but did the prior targets assume this much of a step-down before restoration? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. So, thanks for your question, Olivia. So actually, if you remember, the way we came about the targets is really based on the bottom-up organization design, function-by-function, country-by-country. And that is the reason why we are very confident with the synergies target of $750 million. So this is and remain and is not to be questioned.","Now in terms of phasing, as you pointed out, once the annual versus fiscal is pretty clear, (38:57) second, we have to take into account the current business dynamics, especially in Consumer Beauty. So it's not a question of integration difficulty, this is progressing as expected, and the guys are doing a fabulous job on the field. And we have no surprise whatsoever on that. And now we are in the process of gradually exiting the TSA. So this is progressing as planned and as expected. But now the synergies first are taking into account the fiscal versus the calendar annualization. And second, taking into account some of the business dynamics. Once again, we remain firmly committed on the $750 million synergy target.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I guess, what's going to impact the timing on the exits, the 6% to 8% that you talked about? And what are you doing with those businesses in the meantime? And then following up on the $1.53 EPS target that you guys reiterated, if you have an inventory stuffing issue that you have to comp next September quarter, it seems like some of these issues that you're dealing with for fiscal 2017 and calling it a transition year seem to be bleeding into the next fiscal year as well. So why is that still the right target over time?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So the timing of the divestiture was the first part of your question? Yes? Olivia?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Okay. So I think of the timing of the divestiture, what is really important to be remind is that we are there to maximize the long-term shareholder value. And that's the reason why we are going to take time in order to ensure we maximize it. And there are different scenarios that are currently now at stake, including divestiture in order to do that.","What is fair to say is that now we have identified the brands, which make us confident about the range of 6% to 8% that we have mentioned before. And once again \u2013 so we are going to take some time on that while exploring different scenario, and that's the reason why \u2013 so we are very confident in mentioning the fact that the potential EPS dilution that could come out of that is going to be fully offset by acquisition. And it's also fair to say that ghd and Younique in that clearly fulfilling the role, so I think that's on the one side.","So now on the $1.53 target, as we said, we remain committed on the previously communicated $1.53 target by fiscal 2020. And I think clearly now what we are saying is that it was then on the starting point. Coty is clearly in evolving mode. We are in build-up mode. We are currently building a platform \u2013 forming the platform to be a serious challenger in the beauty industry. That's going to take some time, and because we're in evolving mode, now we clearly say that there are many ways to get there. But the endpoint is exactly the same. It's $1.53 by fiscal 2020, but we will also use our balance sheet in order to get there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit, I guess, about reinvestment needs in the business. So talking about re-staging on COVERGIRL and Max Factor, and also if you could clarify if that was a fiscal 2017 or 2018 plan for those two brands. But if these have been kind of orphan brands, I would think there is something to be said for re-investment needs. So does spending go up kind of versus maybe what you would expect in the first year or two, or is there no change in that thought process around incremental spending? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Hi, Lauren. Thanks for the question. First, the plan to re-launch COVERGIRL and Max Factor are for fiscal 2018. I think this was a part of your question. Regarding the investment, I'm actually convinced that we have enough funds to re-launch the brands, not just these two, but also the other brands. One thing that I would like to point out is the fact that actually the P&G brands, we're spending a substantially higher level of marketing versus what we were spending in the Coty Legacy. So the combination of the funds that we have in the new company, around approximately 26% as a percent of net revenues, in my opinion, are actually enough or more than enough to re-launch the brands, and because there are a lot of things that we need to do are truly in terms of the way we connect with consumers.","And one of the key shift is going to be really going from traditional TV, traditional media to digital engagement. And then as you know, moving that actually creates a lot of efficiencies, so it's not just a matter of spending more, but it's a matter of spending better and connecting better with the consumers, making sure that we speak to them in the right way where they are. And a lot of times, they're not necessarily watching TV, but they are on different digital platforms.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's really helpful. And then also curious on the Legacy-Coty portfolio, some of the work that you had initiated, I guess now going back probably two Christmas seasons ago, cleaning up the promotional activity on some of the fragrance brands, could you talk a little bit about further progress made this season, how those brands performed? And if you think you're kind of yet reset to where we've kind of good base to work from as you go forward to next holiday season? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","I believe that we're making a lot of great progress in preparing strong actions for the Luxury division to return to growth in the next few quarters. We had a strong pipeline coming. Yes, in the last Christmas, we also had an unfavorable, let's say, benchmark versus the previous innovation from the past years. So the Marc Jacobs Decadence which was a success in the previous season or the Hugo Boss The Scent For Him, which was also a big success.","But if I look at some of the elements and some of the things we've done, I'm actually quite pleased because Hugo Boss The Scent For Her, which really marks the entry of Hugo Boss in the female segment, has been a success with number one in the UK, number two in Spain. Chloe continues to do very well. And we have a lot of brands which actually are performing very well in the market and outperforming the market. So we're confident about the actions we're putting in place for the Luxury division.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. So first on M&A. I guess given the weaker results, obviously, you have a bigger gap to fill to hit your long-term EPS target, and obviously, you're looking to offset dilution from portfolio divestitures through M&A. So it sounds like given the recent results have probably been weaker than you'd expected, you're probably going to have to be maybe a little more aggressive with M&A. So how do you balance that given the competitive environment for acquisitions so that you don't overreach either operationally, take too much on your plate given the transitions you're going through, or overpay for acquisitions? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, Joe, thanks for the question. Great questions. So I think that you can see in the recent track record that we have in the M&A, some elements of your answer, the way we approach M&A, the way we execute M&A and the new discipline that we've put, that's the reason why I speak only about the recent acquisition, which is only in the last two years, Bourjois, Hypermarcas, P&G, ghd, Beamly, Younique, have been done in a very disciplined way. This being said, we are for the time being in stabilization mode. And our priority number one is to return the business into organic growth. So we have already a big integration to do with P&G. And we are going to remain focused on that for the time being. So that is very clear in the prioritization.","The second thing, I would say that I usually do not comment on M&A (47:53). So I have shared a little bit on our M&A strategy. But I am of the opinion that the more you talk, the less you do. So I will remain relatively mute on that. And I think I'm not talking too much about it, and in the last two years, we've done quite a bit.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then just one follow-up. I guess, you had mentioned three big headwinds to the top line. You talked about the inventory in the market. How long do you think that will take to clear through? You also mentioned competitive activity and then disruption from the integration. So I was wondering maybe if you could better quantify the impact each one of those had and how long you expect those to continue to be a headwind going forward. Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Joe, we will not quantify specifically the impact of each of them, although Patrice has mentioned the \u2013 that the overall impact has been 300 basis points on our growth in our Q2. So in terms of details, I will not be able to give it to you. What we can say is that we expect our revenues decline in the second half of 2017 to slow down. And, of course, we expect further (49:20) improvements afterwards. And it's also quite important that we look at the fact that we have three divisions. And the three divisions are in a different state of evolution because Professional Beauty is actually growing and the hair portfolio is growing even faster.","Last year, as I said, it's improving the trends because Q2 was already better than Q1, despite we're still tackling wholesale distribution reduction. And we expect, of course, the business to be healthy and to continue to improve in the next few quarters. And it will take time to really return to growth in Consumer Beauty, which is where we have the biggest challenges, as I explained before.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. So just want to follow-up on Bill's question on COVERGIRL. I was hoping you could also discuss shelf space trends across your business to the other brands? And my worry is with some of the revenue declines and distractions from the deal that you could lose shelf space going forward, and it becomes a bit of a perpetuating cycle. So can you give us an update on your expectations for the balance of 2017 after spring resets from the shelf space standpoint? And is that a big risk factor in your mind?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","I don't believe this a big risk factor, and I'll explain why in a second. I believe that now that we are the owner of the entire portfolio, we've finally been able to engage with our customers, with the retailers, in a much stronger way. I truly believe in partnership. I believe partnership is when really there is a win-win situation for both parties. And myself and the team are keenly focused on establishing a much stronger partnership level with the key retailers. We are in the process of doing that. We are engaging with all the key retailers, U.S. but also in the other markets. And the reaction and the spirit is actually very good, because they are seeing the plans that we're putting in place. We're engaging with them. In some cases, we're working together of course in preparing these plans. And when you approach a partnership this way, and in this case, we're also working on re-launching the very iconic brands which are loved by consumers, you know, in the respective markets. Retailers are really appreciative of some of these plans and therefore, I see the future in a bright way, because I believe that the re-launches of the brands will bring us success in the market.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And with those re-launches and some of those plans, I'm still surprised you guys aren't planning to boost advertising spending. And obviously, you touched on it earlier in this call, but I guess can you just take me through your thought process there and what gives you confidence that you really can revitalize this portfolio without spending more? Particularly given you've got this huge synergy bucket from P&G, it just seems like an odd decision not to spend more behind the business to drive a reinvigoration.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Dara, I think actually that one of the key things we could do is also to look at the investment strategy and readjust the investments among the different brands. So there will be some brands, the one that has the higher growth potential that will receive more investment, and some others that eventually will receive a bit less. So we are in the process of exactly doing this, and I think it's a very important financial discipline to look at also retirement investment.","Regarding on your question on spending more overall, I want to go back to my previous answer which is that when you start shifting the traditional media to digital, you actually have way more money to play with and to invest, to be able to reach more consumers. Consumers are truly spending a disproportionate amount of time on social media, on social platforms.","And, I believe that some of our brands have not played the right role in the social engagement, and by shifting the investment actually we will achieve not only the consumers that we want to achieve, but also in the right place and the right time, and the overall connection with the brand will improve. And this is clearly part of the logic of why I answered before that we believe we have enough funds for our future success and re-launches.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah, and so based on that, Dara, and the other point is that, when you look at our Q2 results, our operating margin has been impacted also by all the level of the A&CP pre-commitment that we received. And as a result, once again, it's not a question of size of the bucket, it's a question of how you use the bucket in a much more efficient way which is exactly what Camillo has emphasized.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson of Citi Research. Your line is now open.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Just to clarify on the inventory issue of the acquired Proctor brand. I'm a little bit surprised because I feel like that's kind of a regular thing that when you acquire a business you assume that the prior owner had stocked the inventory, so I'm surprised you didn't catch that in your due diligence process and maybe adjust the purchase price of that, or whatever. But my question is, are you sure that the inventory was actually all that high? Or is it just that your sales and the velocity of turning that inventory and getting it through the retail channel has just been slower than you expected? So if you could make the distinction as opposed to exactly what that problem was, that would be great.","And then my second question just has to do, I mean this is the second quarter in a row where you've called out sort of the level of distraction in the organization. Obviously, you've got a ton going on and it seems like the level of activity is increasing not decreasing with the incremental acquisitions. But can you comment just sort of qualitatively on your management team? Do you have the right people in the right places? Do you think you have the right org structure, so that that sort of level of distraction can sort of stop being such a big headwind and you can really just get down to basics. Okay. Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So first, regarding the inventory, Wendy. So we need to put this in a bit of a perspective on the fact that we announced the acquisition of P&G in July 2015, and we closed the merger \u2013 so we closed the deal in October 2016. That's a 15-months period in which we were not able to actually work on any of the P&G brands. We were two competing companies, and we were basically not working at all on that.","So it's a long time for brands to be announced that they would have been sold, but to still be in the hands of their previous owners. So that clearly can cause a higher inventory, and we're not going to now detail specifically the level, but I think Patrice has explained that all the business, the transition issues, which includes a significant high inventory, were around the 300 basis points of growth. So clearly it was quantified.","And in terms of distractions, clearly this is a big reorganization. This is not just putting together two companies, because at the same time we have decided to manage the company in a divisional structure. Now, the choice of the divisional structure in my opinion is absolutely the right choice for the future, because it does allow a level of focus and capabilities and competencies, which are dedicated to specific categories and channels. So, fragrance and skin care in the prestige channel, in the luxury, and clearly color cosmetic and hair color and so on in the mass market, and hair and nail in professional.","So this is \u2013 the level of change is quite large and this is why it's causing the distraction because at the same time, we're in the middle of the integration of the system, which Patrice mentioned. We are not really fully performed. And Patrice, I think, mentioned the timing of the exit from the TSAs.","Regarding having all the people in the right places, we had clearly disorganization clearly meant that a lot of people had new jobs, so they had to move from different places to start the new job on October 3, and I believe that we have now a much stronger set of leaders in place. Of course, we always look to continue to improve the bench and that's part of what we need to do to be successful in the future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. I guess I'm still curious on the distinction of this synergies phasing. So you're trying to tell us that there was a less pronounced change on a calendar year basis than what was previously anticipated. And then what specifically was seen when owning the whole business that caused the push out of synergies. Is there a component of anticipated reinvestment? And then where should synergies hit by segment and geography so that we have some clue of how to track what's going on?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks for the question, Mark. So we are not going to go into a level of detail of synergies by segment and by region. As I mentioned, once again, the synergies that were communicated so far were on an annual basis, and now they're on the fiscal year basis. This is already seeing half of the push. The other part is clearly that some of the synergies are on the SG&A front, and with the current business dynamics, it's clearly we are taking that into account in order to phase it appropriately.","But, once again, what you really need to retain is that this organization has been built on a bottom-up basis in a very precise way, by function, by country. We took a lot of time. We benchmarked that. We know what we are doing. We've done that before. And you know, the $750 million are going to be realized. But you know I think it's fair to say that the current business dynamics is having an impact, and we are functioning and phasing accordingly. But we're still going to realize 80% by the end of fiscal 2019.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then switching back to the commentary on this M&A focus, not new but the re-emphasis. So, on the recent acquisition you did of Younique, I want to understand a bit better why buying a direct selling business makes sense for a branded beauty company? Sort of how you think about that in the context of M&A being a focus going forward and how can you have confidence in growth rates after call it year two, given the volatility historically in direct selling businesses?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So, let me comment on that, Mark, on Younique. I believe Younique is highly strategic, and I really believe that the online peer-to-peer social selling has a lot of potential. And our choice is driven clearly by wanting to partner with a company that has developed a very, very successful business in this area.","And, of course, by our ambition of growing this business by also looking at geographical expansion and further category expansion. If you think that Younique has mainly had \u2013 it's a business, a brand with the color cosmetic, I believe that this brand and in general the platform has the potential to be expanded more. And so \u2013 plus I think that e-commerce for us is a key focus for the future. And the acquisition or the partnership with Younique is a stepping stone for us to improve our capabilities, strengthen our capability in e-commerce.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Gere of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I don't mean to belabor the point, but I guess I will just on COVERGIRL and Max Factor. When you talk about taking an orphan brand and really trying to kind of turn it around, we've seen in the industry, there've been some successes like Old Spice or Oil of Olay type of things. Just wondering, how aggressive you're going to be in terms of changing kind of the perception of the brand or the in-store execution that you're going to be using just because you've seen a lot of growth with some of the masstige brands in the mass channel, NYX or e.l.f., things like that. So just wondering, I appreciate the work that's going into that, but I'm just wondering, should we be expecting something more dramatic than just kind of a step-up in investment and some of the innovation behind there? So I was wondering if you could provide maybe a little bit more context to that question.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Absolutely. Thanks, Jason, for the question. So when we think about COVERGIRL, first of all as I mentioned before the brand, the COVERGIRL, still has the first \u2013 the number one equity in the U.S. in the mass color cosmetic. I think it's quite important to remind ourself as well that we're talking about a brand which is iconic and loved by millions of consumers in the U.S.","Looking at what we plan to do, first of all, we plan to build on the COVERGIRL roots. I think, thinking about the old positioning, every woman can feel that she's a COVERGIRL. I think it's quite important that we don't completely depart from there. But we reinterpret the positioning in a much more modern way, in a more sophisticated way, so that we connect, again, and more with the consumers.","Within the re-launch, we are looking clearly at upgrading the packaging and the way we look in-store in a more modern way, in a more sophisticated way, in a way that would allow for easier navigation. So going back to your question, it's not just a matter of spending and then choosing the right platform to connect, but it's also how we connect and how we communicate with the consumers across all the different touch points.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just one other question. Considering that the new Coty brings in talent from three different organizations, how do you think about putting the right people in the right positions, meaning that if you think about what P&G has done in the past, they were always known for taking some of their talent and moving them, cross-fertilizing ideas to other divisions. So, internally, I guess the question is, internally, are you considering moving people from division to division just to make sure you have the right execution in some of the maybe some of the under-performing businesses? And secondly, would you still look to hire from the outside just to kind of strengthen those teams as well? Thank you very much for the questions.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So I'll start with your second question, then I'll move back to the first. So in terms of how I think and operate in terms of hiring from the outside, I believe that we always need to have a mix between internal promotion and hiring from the outside. Whenever the capability is not present internally, it's always good to tap into the amazing talent that are out there. At the same time, if we have the talent in the house, that's clearly very, very good. And this is different from how other companies have done it in the past because some companies just privileged promotion from the inside.","Regarding your first question, which is about the mobility and the cross-fertilization across the different divisions, first of all I think we need to say that the three divisions require a level of expertise because the knowledge of the category and the channels is very important. This is why also we have decided to structure ourself with the three divisions. That being said, I also believe that people will have to move across divisions in order to fertilize on success and learnings and on capabilities. So it's going to be a mix of both in answering your first question as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser, B. Riley. Your line is now open.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Hi. Your interim CEO had made some comments about his assessment of the mass fragrance category and the structure of that industry. Do you have any updated thoughts on that? And can you give us an update on the dynamics of the mass fragrance category and the ability of the mass retailers to be able to merchandise fragrance in that channel? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So, when in terms of mass fragrance, Linda, so the mass fragrance clearly is suffering as a category overall because of certain dynamics. One of the key element that I think is affecting the mass fragrance is the fact that you \u2013 it's very difficult in the store environment to smell the fragrance, the juice. So that's one of the key driver for trying the new fragrances, and that's still a key barrier there. And I think this is an issue that we in the industry all need to work together with the retailers to try to overcome this barrier.","The second point is that within mass fragrance, I think we need to distinguish between celebrities and other lifestyle brands. Within celebrities, it's fair to say that the \u2013 I would say the last brand of the celebrity brand is decreased, has decreased significantly just because the brand name and the hype behind the celebrity is now shorter. It's just that's what's happening.","Now, when you look at the other side on the lifestyle brands, we have brands like Bruno Banani or adidas or Max, which are actually great brands that we plan to focus in countries like Germany, Russia. These are brands that are doing well. They are, again, iconic brands in the lifestyle mass fragrance in the specific countries. And we believe that they have potential. So again, it's a mixed sort of dynamic within the category.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Monaco. Mr. Monaco, you may begin your conference.","Kevin Monaco - Coty, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Camillo Pane, Chief Executive Officer and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where we list factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. All commentary on organic net revenues reflect the comparison of combined net revenues at constant currency in both the current and prior-year periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business.","In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Camillo.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings call. Our results were generally in line with our expectations, as we delivered steady performance with modest positive organic top line growth, supported by strong growth in a number of brands, emerging markets and new channels, partially offset by some challenges, mainly in Consumer Beauty. Q3 represented another very strong quarter for our Luxury division, while our Professional Beauty division once again demonstrating consistent solid sales growth.","The Consumer Beauty division continues its uneven performance but with encouraging China stability and some bright spots that I will discuss in a moment. The continued stabilization trend of our top line coupled with ongoing improvements in our cost structure resulted in another quarter of healthy adjusted operating profit improvement.","I'm pleased with this progress and with the improvements we've made so far. However, as I've said before, there is still much work to be done before we realize the consistent results that we seek, as we deliver our synergies and continue the integration of the P&G Beauty Business.","Moving on to our divisional performance, our Luxury division delivered outstanding 6.1% organic net revenue growth, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of healthy sales gain. Our strategy, which focuses on increasing premiumization, including a stronger innovation pipeline and superior store execution, propelled growth across all regions and most brands.","We continued to gain share in travel retail, further building upon our leadership position in the fragrance category. Here I would call out our performance in Asia, where we saw strong consumption trends for our key innovation such as Gucci, Bloom and Tiffany, but also new levels in China, Korea, and Thailand. Our European travel retail business also experienced excellent momentum in the quarter.","The continued strong growth in Luxury in EMEA was driven by both innovation as well as channel expansion in key geographies. China, for example, grew strong double-digits driven by the recent rollout of Tiffany's in the country, the continued success of philosophy as well as recent changes made to our go-to-market strategy for Gucci. In fact, Tiffany's launch in China was so successful that it propelled the brand to the top two position at Sephora in China.","As for innovation during the quarter, we capitalized on the continued success of Gucci, which enjoys a strong top 10 position in most key markets by launching Gucci Bloom Acqua di Fiori and Gucci Guilty Absolute Pour Femme with both showing very positive results.","Finally, in March we launched Chlo\u00e9 Nomade which has been showing promising results in its first weeks in the market. Looking ahead to future growth, we have recently launched a new Burberry fragrance and we recently announced a new launch for our Marc Jacobs Daisy franchise for the first time in over four years called Daisy Love with an ad campaign featuring Kaia Gerber.","Moving on to our Professional Beauty division, organic net revenues increased 1.9%, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of positive growth. Our strategy to be the best partner to salon owners and professionals led to growth in all key hair brands and OPI. This solid performance was driven by the continued strength of Wella Professionals, which continues to benefit from the success of our Wellaplex product line, but also from other brands like Nioxin and Sebastian, which are performing well in most channels.","I'm also pleased that OPI continued to grow globally with particular strength in our North America region, which has shown growth \u2013 which have grown for the past four quarters. In fact, both gel and lacquers had a solid growth in the quarters, still benefiting from the restage of our gel product line, which includes new color coordinated bottles.","In Consumer Beauty, net revenues declined minus 4.4% on an organic basis with the backdrop of a challenged mass beauty market and competitive pressure, but with several pockets of strong results including encouraging performance improvement from some of our key brands relaunches. As I've said before, it will still take time for the full recovery of the Consumer Beauty division, although we're seeing signs of stabilization improvement.","Europe was moderately better in the quarter compared with the performance of the first half of the fiscal year. In the UK, we observed some encouraging results from the relaunch of Clairol Nice 'n Easy in our latest Root Touch-Up innovation. In emerging markets, Consumer Beauty continues to gain share in Brazil, Turkey and Mexico.","Speaking about Brazil, I'm pleased to see a continuing increase in share across most brands, although the trade has been aggressively managing inventory levels in response to price readjustments creating some near-term headwinds for Coty Brazil, but ultimately, creating a healthy business in the future.","In China, since creating our feeder structure, our focus has been on delivering a new fast beauty model, opening more retail distribution in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and initiating our business partnership with Alibaba.","Regarding brand performance, Max Factor global relaunch including the You x Max Factor campaign, led to double-digit growth versus the year ago period fueled the best success in China and in the Middle East as well as a return to growth in the UK.","Bourjois maintained its number one position in the Middle East and we just launched the brand in China this quarter. In the U.S., most retailers have now received the new COVERGIRL wall graphics and imagery, while the phasing of new products is ongoing with a complete nation-wide conversion expected by calendar year end. Overall, the beginning of our relaunch is showing encouraging improvement of our sellout in the last couple of months. We expect sales to continue showing gradual improvement over time. Although we continue to emphasize that a COVERGIRL recovery will take time, it should be evaluated over several quarters.","For Clairol, our recently launched new ad campaign in the new Nice 'n Easy technology translated to improved sellout trends for the Nice 'n Easy and Root Touch-Up pillars. However, reduction in distribution of some of our other hair color brands, such as Vidal Sassoon, has left the performance of our hair color portfolio under pressure. We continue to focus on driving improvement in sales through our brand building activities.","Younique generates strong but smaller growth compared to the last quarter. In Q3, the recruitment of presenters continued at a very strong pace. Active presenters of 250,000 grew modestly versus year ago given the high base comparison. Other KPIs such as frequency of purchase and value per presenter continued to show very positive progress. We expect these trends to continue through Q4, as Younique prepares a new set of launches for fiscal 2019.","On that note, Younique has just launched its first fragrance and its first joint project with Coty, which opens an exciting new category for presenters. Looking ahead, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Younique as we develop this platform for the future.","I would now like to pivot to a key growth pillar which is the acceleration of our end-to-end digital transformation including e-commerce. We continue to focus on transforming our digital capabilities across the organization. And the launch of our digital accelerator this quarter is a key milestone in this transformation. This new program allows technology startups to share their latest innovations at Coty's Quarterly Digital Accelerator Summit and earn the opportunity to work with our diverse brand portfolio. This is truly an exciting new program and I cannot wait to share more with you in the future.","I'm also pleased to report that we again realized strong growth in e-commerce revenues on our base business in all three divisions ahead of the market. Let me just comment on our previously announced brand portfolio optimization program, which is now concluded, resulting in the reduction of 14 brands, including Guess, Cerruti and Playboy. The streamlining with our portfolio allow us to focus on both brands, where we are particularly suited to drive long-term revenue growth. We are confident that we are creating the right portfolio brands across categories to continue fueling our growth. Patrice will provide further details in a few minutes.","I'm very encouraged with what we have achieved so far in fiscal 2018, including the continued stabilization of our performance, the continuing integration of the P&G Beauty Business and the relaunch of many of our brands. There is certainly still much to do. But I'm confident that our commitment to our growth strategy is working, and has put us on the right path to a full recovery for Coty and I believe that these results show that.","As I told you last quarter, revenue recovery will not be a straight line, but we'll continue to aim to deliver modest organic net revenue growth for the second half of the year. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to aim for a healthy improvement in the second half of the year versus the prior year with most of the impact coming in Q4, as we continue to deliver on our emerging synergies.","I will now turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Camillo, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter saw further progress across several areas including the P&G Beauty Business integration, the optimization of our brand portfolio and the delivery of results consistent with the framework we have provided.","Reported net revenues reached $2.2 billion in the quarter, a 9.4% increase versus last year at actual rates. Excluding the impact of exchange rates and the contribution from Burberry and one month of Younique, organic net revenues were up slightly at 0.2% versus prior year at constant currency. I am particularly pleased with the quality of earnings delivered this quarter.","First, our adjusted gross margin was 64.3%, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to the realization of benefits from our synergy program. This realization has been seen in all three divisions and will continue to be a focus area in the future to allow us to achieve sustainable operating margin improvement. This increase has also allowed us to dial up some marketing spend in the period to support our multiple brand relaunch assets as planned. All this, combined with a tight cost discipline which is and remains a priority, has resulted in a 9.4% decrease in our adjusted operating income to $228 million or an equivalent 10.2% of net revenues.","Adjusted net income of $96 million was lower due to higher net interest expense and a slightly higher tax rate resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.13.","In a seasonally low quarter in terms of cash flows, the progress in the integration of the P&G Beauty Business translated into partially high operating and capital expenditure cash cost. Looking ahead, our focus on cash and working capital management remains absolutely unchanged and we expect cash generation to improve over time as the top line and shape of the P&L continue to improve. We also continue to return cash to shareholders, utilizing more than $90 million to pay dividends during the quarter.","Let us now focus on our progress in building a clear challenger in the beauty industry. The overall integration is progressing in line with our timetable. As we advance toward the end of the integration, we have fine tuned our original estimate made two years ago and have broadened the scope including further go-to-market changes, systems enhancements and more complete one order, one shipment, one invoice. As a result, we now expect to incur a slight increase in one-off cost from $1.2 billion to approximately $1.3 billion.","The CapEx will remain in line with the original estimate of approximately $500 million. As far as the synergies are concerned, we are confirming that we are in line with our progress to achieve 50% of the $750 million synergies by the end of this fiscal year and expect to achieve realization of the balance by the end of fiscal 2020.","Last but not least, as mentioned in my opening remarks, I am pleased to say that we have just finalized our previously communicated brand portfolio rationalization program. This is an important milestone towards objective of simplifying the business and optimizing the allocation of resources. And as a result, we have 14 fewer brands in our portfolio. We achieved this rationalization by being very financially disciplined, with around mid-single digit annual EPS impact. As already discussed, the proceeds have been used to pay down debt.","I would now like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet and the recent successful refinancing of our capital structure. Despite volatile market conditions in April, we executed the full refinancing of our debt capital structure, including the issuance of our first bond offerings. There were a number of benefits realized with this refinancing, including simplifying the dual capital structure created as a result of the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business; decreasing the weighted average cost of debt while extending the debt maturity profile; increasing the fixed rate portion of net debt outstanding to 50% of our portfolio and further diversifying our funding base across different markets while properly matching euro debt and cash flows. This refinancing has created a solid foundation upon which we can continue to build a global challenger in beauty.","In summary, we are pleased with the progress made during the quarter with the quality of Q3 earnings and with the strengthening of our balance sheet, which are all important steps in building the right foundation to achieve our long-term strategic objectives.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your question please?","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi, good morning. So a couple questions. First of all, could you maybe disaggregate the growth in ALMEA between Brazil or Latin America and what the negative impact from that was versus the growth in China?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","I think, Faiza, thanks for the question. Our performance by region is actually very positive for Luxury and Professional Beauty where we've experienced growth across all regions with high levels in ALMEA. When we look at Consumer Beauty, it's fair to say that we continue to really have more pressure in North America and Europe, but in ALMEA, we are growing and because of the destocking that we had in Brazil, we have slowed down our growth in Q3. Really not taking consideration of the Brazil growth, we're actually experiencing good level, a strong level of growth in the rest of ALMEA in Consumer Beauty and we're quite pleased with that. That includes China.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then Camillo, I just wanted to ask you, you've been a company in transition for several years and as you look ahead to fiscal 2019, it seems you're generally on track to stabilize the business. So I'd love to hear sort of what your strategic priorities are going to be and what areas you will be spending most of your time on. And related to that, can you discuss how you're viewing M&A as you look ahead to next year? Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yes. As I said, I think we are seeing a good sign of stabilizations and also actually we have two divisions out of three that continue to perform very well. And now this has been happening for a number of consecutive quarters.","When I look at my strategic priorities, I think they are in line, and where I will spend a lot of time, they are in line where I discussed previously in one of the previous quarter in terms of strategy. So I will spend a lot of time on innovation because we need to continue strengthening our innovation process to be faster and that will result in a stronger innovation pipeline, although we're making good progress in this area.","The second area is definitely the digital transformation and one thing that I can say that I'm pleased with the progress because we are experiencing strong level of growth in our e-commerce sales growth, which is ahead of the market in all the three divisions.","And the third part where I will clearly spend time is the continued relaunch of some of our key brands. I think a lot of focus has been put on the COVERGIRL and Clairol launch in the past couple of quarters. But it's fair to say that across the different portfolio of Consumer Beauty, we still have to continue clearly with the COVERGIRL and Clairol work, but also to work on some of the other brands which require a strong consumer connection.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question ...","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","And on M&A I will not comment specifically. So, that's probably the last part of your question. But Patrice over time has said that this is part of our future strategy, although at the moment we are clearly focusing on completing the integration and returning closely to the results that we're seeing, that we want to have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your question please?","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey guys, good morning. So it sounds like China, travel retail and e-commerce were all key drivers behind the revenue growth in the quarter. We've been spoiled by most other beauty companies breaking out how much those businesses are worth to sales mix. You guys haven't been as generous with us, but I was hoping, given their importance to your revenue growth recently, you'd be willing to provide us with some more detail on how large each of those areas are now as a percent of your sales mix. And then just conceptually, as you look out to next year, how should we think about the momentum there and if it's sustainable as we look out to fiscal 2019? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Dara, for the question. We will not really go into the details of the specific size of the three areas. But what I can tell you is that we are very pleased with the performance in China. In one of the previous calls I did mentioned that one of the earlier steps that we took, which was [indiscernible] at that time, at the beginning of the merger, was to go straight into an afflilate model, so in-house operation in China across the three divisions, so to move straight right away from distributor setup to in-house and affiliates. And I have to say that both in Luxury and Consumer Beauty but also Professional, our structure is paying off, because we're experiencing a strong level of growth.","In Luxury, for example, we are I think the fastest growing fragrance company in China. But also it's not only that. It's the fact that it's the quality of the work that I'm seeing with digital innovation, with the partnership with Alibaba, with the work that we're doing with the Tmall. At the moment, we already have six brand stores on Tmall and we plan to add more in the next 12 months. This brand store that we have are in Consumer Beauty and Luxury, but also in Professional. So overall, strong work in China.","And one more thing that I would like to say that we're also focusing on delivering an innovation pipeline that is more suited and focused on the Chinese consumers.","When I look at travel retail, I think what is important to say that this has been quite a strong channel for us. For quite a long period of time, we are the fragrance leader in travel retail. And it's interesting that we are achieving growth in all the different regions. And this is not only driven by the Gucci and the Tiffany that I mentioned, but also by the philosophy, for example, which is going very well in travel retail. And another, I think, interesting fact is that actually Tiffany in travel retail in Asia is performing at the same level in Gucci Bloom, which again shows how important it has been, the launch of Tiffany for us.","And the last thing is we are, as many companies are doing, focusing on the Chinese consumers, also for travel retail, and therefore we are developing more Chinese friendly products. We're engaging more digitally; we're focusing on gifting which is quite an important element in the Chinese culture. It is also an important part that fits very well with the fragrance business that we have.","I think e-commerce I have already mentioned that we are growing strongly ahead of the market, across the two divisions. This is a big focus for us. And since I have announced a new e-commerce structure, the renewed focus on this channel, I have to say that we've seen a step up in the performance of these channels across the three divisions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi. Your question, please?","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about the impact of the divestiture program? I think you initially said it was 8% of sales that you were targeting but the impact is only mid-single digit on EPS. Is that all in next year? Because I know you've already been selling some of these brands. So can you just clarify specifically as we model our fiscal 2019 results, what impact we should see on both the top and the bottom line?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Wendy. Great question. So on the bufferization. First, so when we talk about 6% to 8%, we talked about that two years ago and the work that we have done in the course of these two years is to have a thorough review of the portfolio and to see with the performance to-date, the brand positioning, the brand potential and the strategic fit with our portfolio which one would stay within our (26:32). So, we have decided to either discontinue or sell 14 brands. What I said is that the EPS impact was on an annual basis mid-single digit that you are going to see as from now. So two month in the coming quarter in Q4 and then the rest in the quarters to go.","And we didn't specifically mention what was going to be the impact on the top line. What I can share with you is that it will be very modestly growth accretive on the overall portfolio of Coty, Inc. And the other data point that I can give you is that actually this roughly represents 6% of the \u2013 it's mainly in Consumer Beauty and it represents 6% of the Consumer Beauty portfolio excluding Younique.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","And are all of those brands going to be...","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","And the proceeds have been used ...","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Yeah.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","And the proceeds as a whole with share have been used to pay down the debt.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Okay. Got it. And all of those transactions are done. It's not like you're waiting to get proceeds in the door or commitments to be signed.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Correct.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Got it. And then I actually had just a second follow-up question, actually on OPI. The fact that that business came in \u2013 I know it's not a huge brand, but it still caught my eye because I know the nail category has been so tough. So would you be willing to say this is sort of the beginning of maybe some growth in nail? Was this just something specific you were doing in OPI that boosted market shares temporarily? Just because I know it's been such a tough spot for a long time now category wise.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Wendy, thanks for the question. I think that on OPI I can tell you a couple things. First of all, the nail category is \u2013 it's true that it is under pressure in the mass retail where it continues to decline although the decline has been softening in the last couple of months. But here we are talking about a brand that is mostly sold through the Professional channel and to the Luxury, prestige channel. It's mostly really a Professional brand. And in the Professional channel, we are not seeing a big decline in the category or \u2013 I cannot tell you the category is growing a lot, but definitely is not as soft as really mass retail. Because the service that consumers are getting continues to be very, very appealing. And OPI is absolutely a great brand, the biggest brand in professional nail care in the world. And the reason why we are achieving a good result in OPI is twofold. First is because it's now being managed by the Professional Beauty division which is the division that has the highest level of expertise in B2B, so in dealing with a service channel and therefore having the right attention skills and capabilities on how to educate and service and provide to the professional nail channel because of course this is the division that has been dealing with the hairdressers in the hair category for decades. So that's truly part of the DNA.","And the second one is that we had a couple of very good innovation OPI which are also helping to propel growth and one is really the January launch, which I have mentioned a while ago and the second one is a couple of very strong collection. OPI is truly part of the pop culture, especially in the U.S. Therefore, getting the right collections in the hand of the retailers, consumers and the professionals is absolutely key. So I can tell you the Lisbon collection is performing quite well. And I think the combination of the three factors, capability, innovation are driving OPI growth at the moment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your question, please?","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, and good afternoon or good morning everyone. Wanted to ask about free cash flow. So just in general, I guess it's been a little bit weaker maybe than expected. So how should we think about it sort of broadly relative, I guess, to what you had outlined a couple of years ago on the roadshow and just in terms of puts and takes? You'd commented on some of the cost today, but just on the actual cash from operations generation. And then how do you think about that as the ability to repay debt? What's a reasonable level to think about from debt reductions going forward? And if you could give whatever the impact was on the proceeds from the divestitures that would be helpful too.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Great question. Thank you. Thank you, Mark. So cash is and remains a top priority for the corporation and currently it's very clear to all of us that we have the firm intent to deleverage the business. So that's really just to set the scene. This quarter is a low seasonal quarter from a cash generation standpoint. That's point one. Point two, for this quarter, we have built up, intentionally we have built up some inventory to prepare for the DC consolidation. So that had an impact on the working capital.","Third, we have accrued some one-off costs for the integration in the previous quarter that had a significant cash impact into this quarter. So I would say that this quarter has been abnormally low from a cash flow generation and as a result, the leverage now is closer to 4.5 while normally it was before at 4. But clearly in the course of Q4, we are aiming at coming back to a normal level and working capital is and remains a priority. I remind all of you that I've already mentioned that we were at zero working capital which is a best-in-class performance in this industry and that this continues as is and so we have the firm intention to deleverage the business. I'm not going to give you a target. But clearly as from next year, we want to deleverage the business and that's a key focus and we are gearing up the organization to be able to do that.","On top of that as you know, we have already incurred most of the one-off costs, which means that this will weigh significantly lower in fiscal 2019 and will increase our ability to reduce and to pay down debt. I am not going to give you \u2013 I'm sorry, but I will not disclose the exact amount of the proceeds, but as I have said and also as I've said in the credit roadshow, we have already used these to pay down debt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky from Wells Fargo Securities. Your question please?","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a clarification on the last one on the divestitures and the proceeds. I guess I'm not seeing anything in the cash flow statement. Is that a Q4 impact and was that debt paid down in Q4?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Correct.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And I guess if we could go back to the restages. I guess how would you view the success of the restages to date? Or I guess is it simply too early to tell I guess given you really didn't see the benefit in Q2, or in Q3, excuse me. Are all the new products on shelf? Are all the fixtures in place? Was there any impact this quarter from discounting older merchandise during the restages? And then finally, can you walk through the degree of acceleration and sell-through that you've seen if there has been any? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Joe. Look, the restages are focused on the top ones. So really COVERGIRL in the U.S., Clairol in the U.S., UK and Canada. We also actually restage also Max Factor in the rest of world, which I can mention a couple of words. Starting with COVERGIRL, we are encouraged by the performance of COVERGIRL so far, and we have seen early signs of stabilization. The brand has gone from primarily double-digit declines prior to the launch to low a single-digit decline in March and April. And not only we're seeing improvement in sellouts, but also we're starting to stand the losses in share and actually we had a couple of weeks in which we had share growth versus prior year. And prior to the launch, I have to say that the brand had not really positive share gains for quite a long time.","So when we look at the sellout results, we're encouraged by seeing these improvements as I mentioned, and there are a few other things that are encouraging, like for example the organic online conversations that we keep seeing on COVERGIRL. They are growing double-digit and normally this is a positive indicator of future consumer connection. And that's how we're forming our encouragement and opinion.","I think you asked about the how much product, or the new product has reached the shelf for COVERGIRL. What I can tell you is that \u2013 I did mention this. This is a big undertaking with over 1,000 SKUs changes in over 60,000 doors. So by now for an execution point of view, 95% or so, basically almost all retailers have now received the full, the new wall graphic or the new (36:17) from a new product contributor for also new packaging. Only 30%, 40% of the new product is on shelf today and we do expect 100% of the new products to be on shelf by the end of the calendar year. So, it's phasing in. The wall has been changed, the imaging as well, but from the packaging, we're in the middle of this. Despite that, as I said, there are some encouraging results.","Looking at Clairol, which was the second, I would say, major relaunch. What we've done is that in our initial phase of the relaunching (36:49), we focused our investment, 2%, Nice 'n Easy which has also a new technology and Root Touch-Up which has a new innovation with a temporary Root Touch-Up product. And we're starting seeing positive momentum in both Nice 'n Easy and Root Touch-Up with an improvement of week over week of our sellout performance in both U.S. and UK although we're still declining but we're not declining as much as we were declining before the relaunch. In Canada, where the transition has been faster, we're actually experiencing some share growth, so this will give us some optimism on the future.","Now, it's also fair to say that the overall Clairol brand is still under pressure because there are other parts of the brand like Age Defy and Vidal Sassoon which is part of our hair color portfolio, which are under a lot of pressure and therefore they are big offsetting the improvements we're seeing on Nice 'n Easy and Root Touch-Up.","And the last piece \u2013 and on Clairol, in terms of implementation of the new packaging, we're also in the middle. This is a bit slower than COVERGIRL because it takes a bit longer. This is a category, a product category that consumers buy with less frequency than color cosmetic and therefore it's going to take a little bit of a longer bit. So, we're in the middle as well.","And the last one that I want to mention is Max Factor where we have not changed the packaging, but we have changed the imager of the wall and the positioning with a new creative. We have a new creative, new positioning and this is driving actually strong double digit growth in several markets including Middle East and China and this is of course encouraging for us as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your question, please?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. First in, on COVERGIRL, where do you think you are in terms of sell through of old inventory? And then when it gets to a steady state, how do the margins of the revamp line up compared to that of legacy COVERGIRL? And last quarter you said that Consumer Beauty should have sequential improvement in second half. Do you still think that's the case?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Olivia. In terms of sell through inventory, as I said we are in the middle. So, that's what I mentioned before. New products, which includes innovation, but also new packaging for the classic, standard products, we are at around 40% of the (39:15) shelf and the rest still to come. So we have I feel \u2013 we expect this to really be fully complete at the end of calendar 2018.","In terms of innovation margin, what I can tell you is that old innovation that we're bringing are actually performing better than the previous innovation that we launched a few quarters ago. So that's also very encouraging because this is really the first innovation bundle, let's call it, that is being developed by the new team, by the new Coty. And we can say that from a margin point of view, there is no impact meaning that the new innovation is in line or accretive versus the previous innovation.","In terms of an estimate for our second half of 2018, as I said, we're not really changing our view versus Q2. So we really aim to deliver modest organic revenue growth for the second half of the year. And in terms of operating margin, we continue to aim for a healthy improvement in the second half of the year versus the prior year with most of the impact in Q4 because of the delivery of our synergies.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thanks. And then a second question on synergies. You talked about being on track for the achievement of synergies. Ad spend's already around 25%, 26% of sales. You talked about some of the digital investments that you've made already. So how do you think about the flow-through of savings as we go into next year? Are there other investment plans or should we start to see more of that synergy flow through?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So as we have already said, most of the \u2013 we will have by the end of this fiscal year realized 50% of the synergies. What we have done is that because we have inherited from a smaller business and from a more distressed consumer beauty business, we have used the synergies to mitigate some of the negative financial impact.","So now this being said, going forward, you should see the bulk of these synergies, of the remaining 50% that we will generate in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, to fall bottom line. This being said, between quarters, I've always said we might dial up the investments to further fuel the top line. So that might value one quarter versus the other quarter. But generally speaking, the bulk of the synergies going forward should pull that in line. And that's one of the way to achieve our ambition to achieve higher teens operating margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Your question, please?","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thanks. Just to follow up on the last \u2013 on the synergy delivery. I think it was on the last quarter's call you talked about 50% and then 80% of synergy captured by the end of 2019 and then all of it by 2020. I think earlier in your comments you said just 50% over the next two years. I realize you're talking about 30%-20% versus 25%-25% but would you still think you'd get 80% synergy capture by the end of 2019 in addition to all of it by being on track for 2020? Forgive me if I heard that wrong. And secondarily, if you could talk about the expansion in operating profit in Professional. Impressive. Is that, synergy capture? Is that a mix and margin issue? Any comments you could make there. Thank you very much.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Great question. So let me clarify. So the synergies, the phasing of the synergies are the following and remains the following: 50% by the end of this fiscal year, 80% by the end of fiscal 2019 and 100% by the end of fiscal 2020. So this is the phasing of the synergies and what we have also said is that the synergies in fiscal 2018, so this fiscal year, we'll will be back end loaded and you should see some benefit of that in Q4.","Now regarding your question on the Professional division, you are absolutely correct. The profitability of the Professional division has increased by 650 basis point to 6.7% operating margin. Well, I must admit the starting point was low, because it was breakeven last year. But this being said, it has been on the back of two main elements; the first one is the premiumization of the gross margin. So as I've said in my script, gross margin is a priority of the corporation, it's really the pulse of the corporation and what allows us to further invest in our brands. So there have been some interesting development in Professional Beauty on the gross margin. And they have also attacked our cost structure to be able to boost the profitability and they have done that quite successfully. So that's the two elements that are driving the 650 basis point improvement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your question please?","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. So, hi. Good afternoon there. So I know Nielsen doesn't cover all your businesses, but just as on a sequential basis the data in the U.S. looks like you continue to lose some distribution points for Consumer Beauty. So I was wondering if you can call \u2013 in the last call I was wondering if you can comment of course on the reposition of COVERGIRL. And on the last call I recall you said that you were guiding for flat distribution for this year in the U.S. So can you just talk about how you're seeing it now relative to your plans and if you're starting to see it flatten in the back half of the year?","And the second question is a clarification on Wendy's question. And you said in the portfolio rationalization, you're looking at a mid-single digit impact on EPS starting in the fourth quarter fiscal. So does that mean like a cent EPS, like a $0.04 to $0.05 EPS impact over the next four quarters, or you're looking at a percentage impact? I just want to clarify. And on that, what is the type of margins you get in this business? I'm assuming those margins were higher. So, there will also be a margin impact I'm assuming as you pointed out in the past. Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Andrea, for the question. Yeah, looking at distribution, what I can tell you is that looking at what happened in the last few months, COVERGIRL distribution has stayed relatively flat. And so, from that point of view, based on the improvement in the performance that we have seen on COVERGIRL, we would expect to retain the vast majority of our shelf space in the U.S. However, as you know, shelf space decisions are at the discretion of our retail partners.","Now when you look at Clairol, it's a similar situation because at total level, Clairol distribution has actually stayed flat over the spring, so the January, March shelf reset. But what happened within the Clairol brand, there has been a bit of rightsizing between the different sub-brands because we had some declines in nonproductive sub-brands like Age Defy or Vidal Sassoon, but at the same time we also had gains in ancillaries and Root Touch-Up segments. So, overall, the overall Clairol distribution has stayed more or less flat, but with a bit of a shift within the segments.","And in terms of expectation, we are working clearly with our retailer partners, so we're seeing improvement in our performance, but of course these are ongoing discussion for the future. You want to talk...","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. So regarding the clarification question on the portfolio optimization. So your analysis is correct in the sense that the mid single-digit EPS impact is on a full-year basis, and because we have realized and completed the portfolio optimization early May, you should have a two-month feedback of this mid-single digit EPS on an annual basis. You should have the corresponding impact in Q4, and also in three quarters of next year.","So, now in terms of operating margin, normally we don't go to that level of detail, but it is fair to say that what we've said also before, that these brands were usually profitable, more profitable than the average of Consumer Beauty. So you should have the corresponding impact on the shape of the P&L.","Operator","Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","And on EPS, the mid-single digit impact on an EPS not on the percentage, on cents.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your question, please?","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. I just wanted to go a little bit more into detail on Brazil because if I recall, last quarter you guys talked about competitive pressure on pricing in Brazil. So meaning you had competitors that were being pretty aggressive on pricing but you were still gaining share. And then this quarter in the release it talks about or suggests that you've taken pricing up in Brazil and then on the call you talked about inventory destocking.","So I'd just love a little bit of kind of I guess connecting those three threads. And if you could give us a little bit more of a discussion of Q2 versus Q3, I know Clairol was a big benefit, was a big success last quarter in Brazil, but then also the local brands. So, I'm just having trouble putting all the pieces together. Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Lauren. I'll try to connect the dots. So, what happen is, first of all, I think the most important thing is to say that in Brazil we continue to experience very strong sell out in market share growth across most of the brands and we've been growing more than twice the speed of the categories in which we play. So that is really a very strong result that we continue to have. Similar to what we had in the previous quarter which I had mentioned before and it's clearly a very strong indication that our portfolio is really reaching out to consumers in the right way.","What I felt in this quarter is that really we wanted to have a healthier business and so we went through a series of actions including increased pricing and what happened is, given the current tough economic conditions we have experienced in this quarter, quite a large destocking effort by the retailers, and which \u2013 it's something that can happen when you increase price. They need to manage inventory at the beginning, immediately after the price increase. But overall this is going to create a much healthier base for our business going forward. And that to me is a positive, clearly, effect of the type of actions that we have taken.","Connecting the dots, I think the most important point between Q2 and Q3 that our Brazil business continues to be healthy from a consumer point of view, from a sellout point of view, from a connections with retailers in the markets and the consumers. And from a P&L point of view, we're taking steps to have a better margin so that we can continue investing in this business. If these steps are creating some short-term headwinds from a trade reduction point of view, that's something that we need to manage, and we're managing at the moment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink from Jefferies. Your question please?","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys. I'd like to dig into the marketing step-up. I think you called that out the last couple of quarters. If you could just talk a little bit about where you're focusing some of your marketing spend. And if we should think about this as a temporary step-up to support the relaunches or if you're seeing this as an elevated level that we should model over the next couple of fiscal years just to support the overall brand portfolio. Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Steph, for the question. In terms of marketing spend, what I can tell you clearly that when you relaunch brands like COVERGIRL and Clairol which had not been performing for a while, you do require few more fuel, especially at the beginning to kick start the engine and that's what's happening, especially in the month of March, so towards the last part of the quarter that we're releasing today. In terms of this being a temporary setup, what I can tell you is that you always have different phasings within your marketing investment. When you relaunch several brands, it is normal to have this setup. On a long-term basis, we remain confident in our 25%, approximately 25% of marketing as a percentage in our revenues is the right level that we need as an overall company to bring Coty to the success that we want and we deserve.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser from D.A. Davidson. Your question, please?","Linda Bolton Weiser - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Hi. I was wondering if you could venture a guess or speculate on why the mass color market is declining, at least in the U.S. And Est\u00e9e Lauder, on their earnings call, mentioned that they think that consumers could be trading up. So do you think there's trade-up going on from mass supressees (52:59) and can you just comment on what you think about the trends in the market? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Linda, for the question. Yeah, I think it's true that the mass market in general in the U.S. but also in some key European markets like UK and Germany are experiencing some productive softness. And I do agree that this is driven by continued trade-up to prestige. But also there is the element of high growth rate of e-commerce. And in general, I think the consumers are looking for a better experience. From our point of view, we'll continue to work with all our retailer partners, mass retailer partners to improve this in-store experience. We're doing a lot of digital innovation as well in partnership with some of the big mass retailer partners. But also as I mentioned in one of my previous answers is we are increasing significantly the effort on e-commerce, which is one of the growing channel. And also Younique, of course, which is a new channel for us that provides more personalized experience to our consumers.

Today we will address our quarterly and year-end financial results, as well as our long-term growth roadmap that verify into where is Coty 2020.","Let\u2019s start discussing our full year and quarterly results. Fiscal 2014 was a challenging year for Coty. We reported a marginal decline both on top-line and bottom-line. Our net revenues decreased 1.6% and our adjusted net income decreased 2.2%. The revenue decline was mainly due to the pressure we had on our nail business, particularly in the U.S. which more than offset the growth we had in the Fragrance and Skin Care segments.","Geographically, we recorded solid growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America, more than offset by the decline in North America. Importantly, we delivered on our strategy to expand our presence in emerging markets as sales in these regions grew 10% during the year, reaching 29% of our overall net revenues on a like-for-like basis. Our fourth quarter net revenues slightly declined at minus 0.7%.","During the fiscal year, the consolidated market remained rather soft. In Western Europe, the Fragrance market was flat in the year and in the last quarter. While the mass color market grew marginally in the year but turned negative in the last quarter. This overall class situation in Europe is mostly driven by continuous softness in South European countries. Due to continued economic headwinds in the region, we believe it is unlikely to see an improvement of the market dynamics anytime soon.","In the U.S., accounting for close to 30% of our business, the total fragrance market was negative 1.5% for the year driven by decline in the mass channel, while prestige was overall flat. The U.S. color cosmetic market in mass was flat in the year a negative 2% last quarter. Nail dragged the color market down as it recorded a decline of 7% for the year and a 13% decline in the last quarter. Encouragingly, we have seen in the last few weeks a progressive improvement with the nail market still negative but in the mid to low-single digit. We believe that this change in the market dynamic is also a result of an outstanding consumer response to the Sally Hansen Miracle Gel launch which I am reviewing in more detail later.","Let me now give you some information on our performance by product segments. In Fragrances, our net revenues grew 1% in the fiscal year and in the last quarter. Growth reflected good performance by our power brands Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Chloe and Davidoff and by the more recent Bottega Veneta, Roberto Cavalli and Katy Perry brands. Calvin Klein enjoyed strong momentum in emerging markets, such as the Middle East, China, Australia and Eastern Europe.","Also, the recent launch of Endless Euphoria brought the brand to gain market share in the U.S. in the prestige market in the last quarter. Marc Jacobs enjoyed another strong year particularly in travel retail, China, the U.S. and the UK. Chloe keeps growing despite an unfavorable launch phasing versus the prior year thanks to the strength of the signature product line. Growth in the Fragrance segment has been partially offset by the softness of consumption in the mass channel and no renewal of some low volume licenses, in our strategic effort of concentrating on fewer and bigger brands.","Color cosmetic net revenues declined 7% for the year and 4% for the quarter. The decline was due to the nail business. Net of nail our color cosmetic business would have grown low single-digit in the year. As we\u2019ve discussed in detail over the last several earning calls, the sharp slowdown of the nail market triggered retail\u2019s reaction but is aligning in a drastic inventory reduction in the first part of the year and the reduction of the promotions loss granted to the category in the second part of the year.","In the midst of this turbulent environment, we faced a strong competitive attack from many players, particularly low priced brands which turned into market share revolution for the categories of Sally Hansen. However, we are particularly excited to see the first sign of turnaround in our nail business in the beginning of this fiscal year, driven by the launch of the new Sally Hansen Miracle Gel. First sales results are outstanding. According IRI retail panel in the four weeks ending August 11 Sally Hansen hit its highest market share in the last two years. As I said before the all nail category seems to benefit from the positive impact of this launch and I believe this is a confirmation that our strategy of shifting focus from the fashionable special effects to performance driven innovations is paying dividends for us and for the market. Retailers are strongly supported this launch and we\u2019re confident that the success of this initiative will bring back retailers full confidence and interest in the category.","Rimmel continues its strong momentum, recording solid growth in the year and in the quarter, gaining market shares in key European countries and in the U.S. In the U.S., Rimmel was the fastest growing color brand among the top-10 in mass in fiscal year \u201914. The fast innovation phase and the edginess of the market mix supported by an outstanding spokesperson list, including Kate Moss, Georgia May Jagger and Rita Ora and by creating digital program keep resonating in a meaningful way with the young generation.","Turning to Skin & Body Care, net revenues grew 1% like-for-like during the fiscal year with growth across each of our key brands Philosophy, Adidas, and Lancaster partially offset by the sharp decline in TJoy. Philosophy registered a fifth consecutive quarter of growth generated both from increases in the U.S. market and continues international expansion. Adidas continues to enjoy strong momentum in key emerging markets including Brazil, China and the Middle East partially offset by European market softness. Lancaster keeps performing well in the same category and it is finding strong acceptance by the Chinese consumer.","As far as TJoy, we discussed on the last call the poor performance of the brand is our intention to drive changes to the setup of our China business in the mass channel to significantly improve our cost structure and bringing more focus on brands with higher growth potential. Since then we\u2019ve announced in June our new partnership with Li & Fung a leading Chinese company to distribute some of Coty\u2019s international brands including Adidas, Playboy and Rimmel and concomitantly the discontinuation of the TJoy brand. This move will allow us to improve our profitability in the country and in the overall Skin & Body Care segment.","Let\u2019s turn now to our business by region. In EMEA net revenues grew 3% for the year and 4% for the quarter which is a remarkable performance considering the softness of several European markets. Growth was mostly driven by the UK, Travel Retail, Eastern Europe, Middle East and South Africa. In Americas, net revenue declined 9% during the year and 7% during the quarter. As previously discussed, the decline was mostly driven by North America and particularly in the nail category and fragrance statement. This was partially offset by double-digit growth in Latin America with particularly strong results in Brazil where we leverage our new go-to-market partnerships. Speaking of Brazil, our partnership with Avon remains on track with the first Coty brand slated to be included in Avon\u2019s holiday catalog.","In Asia Pacific, net revenues grew 7% in the year and 3% in the quarter. Growth was driven mostly by Southeast Asia where we leverage on our new platform following the acquisition of the StarAsia Distribution Company and Australia where we\u2019re enjoying strong leadership positions in both fragrances and color. In China our growth was low single-digit hampered by TJoy declines.","Our strategic goal to expand our business in the emerging markets to over a third of our total net revenues is well underway. In the last two fiscal years we have built new structures and partnerships in Brazil, the Middle East, South Africa, Southeast Asia, China and Korea. We also drove our product development to better address the specific needs of consumers with completely different beauty cultures and tastes generating lines of products such as Arabian fragrances for the Middle East, skin care with specific texture and light filters for Asia and light concentration fragrances of Latin America. As a result of this comprehensive effort, emerging markets have reached 29% of our total net revenues in fiscal \u201914 up from 26% in fiscal \u201913 on a like-for-like basis. Revenues in the emerging markets grew 10% like-for-like in fiscal \u201914 and 12% in the fourth quarter.","Let\u2019s now spend a few moments on our long-term and short-term future. I first want to come back to our strategic roadmap for long-term growth. Our vision is to strengthen Coty\u2019s position as a global leader in beauty with brand building and creativity at its core. To achieve our vision we have developed a comprehensive plan that we call internally Coty 2020. This plan incorporates many of the elements we shared with you over the last year. Our long-term financial targets remain intact, including growing our net revenues in line with or faster than the markets and segments where we compete, expanding profitability and margins, and generating strong cash flow.","The achievement of our strategic vision and financial targets rest of the following five drivers; one, developing our power brands with strong focus on superior innovation and increased investment in brand support including creative digital marketing and superior in store execution; number two, strengthening our leadership position in the fragrance and core cosmetic categories. Our ambition is to be undisputed number one global player in fragrance and to be among the top-three global players in color. We will also continue expanding our presence in Skin & Body Care with particular focus on emerging markets opportunities. We plan to progress toward our ambition through organic growth of our current portfolio and through a well targeted acquisition strategy; three, progressing our emerging market expansion strategy, which has been very successful in the last two fiscal years with objective to grow the weight of those markets on total Coty net revenues from the current 29% to more than one third; four, leveraging our multichannel distribution capabilities to seize growth opportunities across broad consumer universe and with offerings spanning across different price points; five, gaining efficiency and simplification in our operating model. Thanks to a global efficiency plan that is designed to drive the different cost components of our business. This plan aims at delivering annual savings in excess of $200 million within the next three fiscal years. We plan to use these additional resources to fuel investment behind our key brands and deliver earning growth at a faster pace than sales. The key element of this plan will be addressed in a few moments by Patrice.","I believe that both our targeted revenue and earnings growth will be enabled by our new organizational design and operating model which was announced on the 9th of July and that we\u2019re kicking off in fiscal \u201915. The principle is to evolve our organization from two standalone divisions Coty Prestige and Coty Beauty to a simpler and more integrated organization built around categories and regions. This new organization will help bring a more holistic view of growth opportunities across our other category. It is also expected to increase focus on the specific consumer and retailer needs of each region which is particularly important given our goal of accelerated development in the emerging markets. Finally, it is designed to eliminate duplication and redundancies particularly in back office and commercial market and services, and to simplify our internal processes ultimately bringing operational efficiencies.","Now let\u2019s turn to the short-term outlook. We are entering into the new fiscal year with a strong line-up of new product initiatives in strengthening our retail performance. In the fragrance segment, we have three major launches in the first half of the year on our power brands. First in the row, we have the launch of Marc Jacobs\u2019 Daisy Dream which hit the shelves in the beginning of July. Initial sell through results are very strong bringing the total Daisy franchise to a top-ranking in the U.S., UK and Australia female markets and is off to an outstanding start in travel retail as well.","In the next two months, we plan to launch the new Calvin Klein Reveal globally and Chloe Love Story with initial launch in Europe and rollout to the U.S. in the spring. We will also have high quality initiatives on Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga in top-tier of selected distribution and the launch of Enrique Iglesias and Playboy Generation in mass channel.","In color cosmetic, I already mentioned the outstanding start of Sally Hansen Miracle Gel in the U.S. market. On Rimmel, we are launching as we speak, a new mascara called Wonderful aiming at further strengthening the brand\u2019s premier position in this product category and fueling Rimmel momentum. In Skin & Body Care, we are launching in Q1 a new Adidas line dedicated to the UEFA Champions League, the most prestigious football competition in the world with global awareness and media coverage. On Philosophy, we are planning to launch a new line named No Reason to Hide, the all-in-one solution to skin imperfection.","While we are not expecting a significant improvement in the market dynamics in the next few months and probably an even tougher situation in Europe given current economic headwinds, our objective in the fiscal year \u201915 is to return to revenue growth supported by our aggressive innovation plan, increased marketing spending and continuous expansion in the emerging markets. We are expecting modest growth in the first half of the year as we continue to see softness in our core fragrances and color cosmetic segments particularly in the mass channel and retailers are managing inventory very tightly given the uncertainty of the future outlook.","In this challenging environment, we remain focused on strengthening the retail performance of our key brands to enable a faster pace of growth in the second half. In Fiscal 2015, we are also targeting to expand our operating margin, reflecting our cost reduction effort across the organization. This is expected to materialize in the second half when the global efficiency plan should start having a more relevant impact.","I will now handover the call to Patrice, who will bring you through the financials and the global efficiency plan in more detail. Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","Thank you, Michele and good morning everyone. Our fiscal \u201914 net revenues declined 1.6% on a like-for-like basis while the fourth quarter net revenues declined 0.7%. For the quarter and the year, the decline was driven by our color cosmetic business which was pressured by weakening market trends in the U.S. and Western Europe and the consumption pullback and increased competitive pressure in the U.S. nail categories. On the positive side, most of our power brands grew during the year and we continue to execute to our strategy of expanding our emerging market presence.","During fiscal \u201914, our adjusted gross margin declined by 40 basis points to 59.6%. For the fourth quarter, gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 58.3%. While we continue to make progress in our supply chain savings program, this was more than offset by higher discounts and allowance particularly in the mass channel and negative transactional FX impact. For the year, our reported operating income declined to $25.7 million and our reported net income declined to a loss of $97.4 million driven by the non-cash asset impairment charge we recorded in the third quarter related to our mass channel business in China.","On an adjusted basis, our operating income for the year declined 13% to $500.6 million with the adjusted operating margin down 130 basis points to 11%. This decline reflected lower net revenues and gross margin, increased investment behind our brands with 30 basis point increases in our A&P spending as a percentage of net revenues, and higher investment in emerging markets partially offset by strict cost control in the developed markets. For the quarter, our adjusted operating income increased 10% to $49.8 million reflecting 40 basis point increases in the adjusted operating margins to 4.7%. This increase was driven by the strong focus on fixed cost reduction and lower amortization expense partially offset by lower gross margin and higher A&P spending.","Let us now look at our fiscal \u201914 performance by segment. First, fragrance net revenues which represent 55% of the total business grew 1% like-for-like including 3% volume growth partially offset by a negative 2% price mix, this negative price mix reflected impart a higher promotional activity in the market. Adjusted operating income for fragrances decreased 4% to $355.6 million while the adjusted operating margin declined 60 basis points to 14.2%. This decline was driven by lower gross margins impart reflecting higher discounts and allowances, the negative impact of these activities in the prior as well as the negative effect of transactional FX.","Second, in color cosmetics net revenues declined 7% like-for-like with a 5% volume decline coupled with a negative 2% price mix. Adjusted operating income decreased to $156.8 million with the adjusted operating margin down 270 basis points to 11.5%. This margin contraction reflected lower gross margin due primarily to promotional pressure and an increasing SG&A as a percentage of net revenues.","Third, for the Skin & Body Care segment net revenues grew 1% like-for-like including a 6% volume decline more than offset by a seven positive price mix. This positive price mix reflected a shift in the year to our prestige brands, Philosophy and Lancaster. Adjusted operating loss for the segment increased to $11.8 million from $5.7 million in the prior as we have ramped up the A&P spending behind the brands to accelerate the momentum of these segments. Excluding the TJoy brand which was discontinued in June 2014 the adjusted operating margin in the Skin & Body Care segment would have been positive.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 18.9% compared to 28.2% in the prior driven by a tax benefit of $38.1 million from the settlement of certain foreign audits in the third quarter. As a result of the above our adjusted net income decreased by 2% to $316.2 million, this drop adjusted EPS for the year of $0.81 compared to $0.82 in the prior. For the quarter, our adjusted EPS remained flat at $0.03. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $536.5 million in fiscal \u201914. And after our CapEx our free cash flow for the year was $305 million. This was our fifth consecutive year of generating more than $300 million of free cash flow which demonstrates the resiliency of our multichannel business model through a variety of economic environments.","During the fiscal year, we continued to make strong improvements in our net working capital performance which is a key strength of our operating model. We\u2019re focused on putting this free cash flow to work to enhance shareholder value and during the year in addition to paying a dividend we launched a share repurchase program. We\u2019re successfully repurchasing over 560 million of stock with 100 million purchased in the open market at an average price of 15.11 through the program and the remainder representing the repurchase of shares from our private equity investors consistent with their investment time horizon. We intend to continue with our remaining $300 million in authorized share repurchases.","We\u2019re still continuing to see flexibility in our capital structure to support our growth plans and in that regard we intend to prepay our 2010 private placement notes. We intend to grow a new term loan to prepare the note with the intent to refinance the term loan and other existing bank debt for longer term debt instrument later this fiscal year.","Let me now turn to our global efficiency plan. As Michele discussed in detail our vision is to strength purchase position as a strong global leader in beauty with creativity and brand building at its core. As part of our efforts over the last year to fine-tune our strategy and review our operating model we have identified many opportunities to adapt our business model to unleash the full potential of our business and more optimally allocate our resources.","In total, we target combined annual saving of over $200 million within the next three fiscal years. We anticipate that the cost associated with these savings will total $250 million to $300 million. It is worth noting that this over $200 million savings target includes our previously announced productivity program which we have indicated would drive over $60 million in annual savings exiting fiscal 2016 and the China mass business organization which have saving would drive annual savings of north of $20 million. We will provide annual update on our progress in achieving the target total savings associated with our global efficiency plan.","Now let me spend a few minutes discussing some of the concrete steps we are taking to reach the savings targets: first, our new organization design. As part of the new organizational structure we announced in early July we are currently in the process of transitioning from a divisional structure base on distribution channels to a more integrated structure base around categories and regions as Michele said. We believe this new design will allow for better resource allocation amongst categories and markets more closely aligned marketing and R&D and better leverage our scale across distribution channels. But we believe it will also eliminate many duplications in our previous operating model. For example, we will now have one country general manager in each key region and one, finance and back office support staff rather than two. Our regional dealers will have full ownership over the financial P&L of each global market while our category innovation leaders will be accountable for the strategic P&L.","The second part of our operation improvement is realizing efficiencies in the P&L increasing the direct procurement of material and packaging and the indirect procurement of marketing and promotional material and services. By integrating the two previous divisions we will be much better positioned to leverage our scale across the three segments and for the company as a whole. Third, optimizing the manufacturing and supply chain footprint, as a first step in line with our China organization and especially the TJoy brand discontinuation we have closed two of our out of the three manufacturing plants we had acquired through the TJoy acquisition. The remaining plans will continue to manufacture Adidas for China and other Asian countries. And we will also maintain R&D capabilities.","On top of this we are evaluating other opportunities to optimize our overall supply chain structure. Fourth, improving factory productivity, as part of the previously announced productivity program we are already well into our efforts to improve productivity and manufacturing efficiency in each of our plans. Fifth, savings through active portfolio management, with non-power brands accounting for approximately 30% of our net revenues, we see opportunities to deemphasize some of the non-performing brands. Additionally, we believe there is room to rationalize number of skews across our broader portfolio which will allow for better inventory management and better cost rationalization. In total, we believe the steps we are taking as part of our global efficiency plan will not only position Coty to accelerate supply and growth and expanding geographical reach, but will also contribute to a more profitable and cash generating business model.","With that I will turn the call back to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Can you guys help me? I'm trying to bridge the gap on the sales declines in the U.S. We obviously get the Nielsen data. And if you look at that data, it seems like, for the year, your skin sales declined 7%. But I think you said outside the U.S. mass, the business was actually flat, and so I'm having a real tough time trying to figure out, like, where the incremental declines are, noting that the international business grew. So I know it's kind of a broad, long question, but I'm kind of backing into like 12 points from destocking in terms of the growth in the U.S. mass business. Does that make directional sense to you?","Michele Scannavini","So let me try to see how I can answer to this question. First of all, it\u2019s important for you to know that when we talk about market trends of market share or market performance in the U.S. as source we refer to IRI in terms of retail panel for mass and to NPD in terms of retail panel for prestige. And I specify that because as you know Nielsen is a consumer panel, the following mass and sometimes the number between IRI and Nielsen are not really matching. So I am making my comment on these sources, the sources that they mentioned. So what we see from IRI in terms of market trend for the two key categories where we compete that is fragrance and color, as I said for the total year, mass fragrances was negative and as well in the last quarter of the year and as well keep on being on negative in the first let me say six weeks of this fiscal year.","As far as color is concerned, we have seen the total year being rather flat, turning down to negative performance in the last quarter and then had some improvement in the first six weeks of the year when we turn back to the marginal positivity. As far as nail is concerned instead we had decline through all the year, last year, minus 7% in average, minus 12% the last quarter. Now again, we have seen some better trend in the last six months but still the market be negative in the low single-digit.","Now these are the things that are in my hand. As far as the stocking is concerned, as we discussed we have seen a pretty significant stocking phenomenon at the beginning of last year particularly in color cosmetic and I should say particularly in male, when we are seeing the market turning from 20% growth to being flat and then start declining. And the retailers that were planning the business on a growth of 20% had a very fast and I should say rather drastic decrease over inventory.","Since then the consumption in male kept on declining so the retailer kept on managing their inventory down to align their inventory to the trend of the category. What we see today in the beginning of this fiscal year actually we still see some of the stocking not of the same size of the entity what we have seen one year ago. But we are seeing that there is at least one big retailer in mass that has been rather aggressive in managing in inventory down in the first part of the year. As we have seen also some destocking in prestige, now this is due to two things, number one, as I said before, the market performance has been rather fast particularly in quarter four. So some retailer getting into back-to-school and early the season had to reflect the inventory based on the consumption trend.","Number two, our retail performance in the U.S. in the last few months has not been good enough. So this is a slowdown replenishment order and that these have impacted also the phenomena of reducing inventory on our brand. So all-in-all I should say that still today we see some inventory reduction, not at the level that we saw one year ago but there is still some needed to be adjust the inventory to the recent trend.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","","I wanted to follow-up on Europe, where I was reading the commentary that you guys gave about Europe and maybe a little less positive than what we had talked about a couple of months ago. So I wanted to see if there's really any change in your thought process there. And then a second question would be if we take a look at your cost save targets, it's a fairly substantial number as a percentage of sales. Can you talk about how you plan to use that in terms of dropping to the bottom line, or are there specific brand investments that you see -- think that you need to make in terms of the use of these savings? Thanks.","","Michele Scannavini","Okay. So let\u2019s talk of Europe first. Now if I look at purely the beauty market numbers, I should say that we don\u2019t see significant changes there. The market is softer as we described mainly driven by declines in the South European countries, partially offset by marginal growth in Central and Northern Europe. It is true that when would we see, and I am sure you read this on the newspaper, the situation Europe is going through from an economic standpoint is difficult to be positive at least on the short run. Several key countries have zero or negative GDP growth, several key countries in a quite depletion situation this creating a lot of concern in many governments but still not visible structural reports, unemployment is raising so I don\u2019t see concrete element to think that anytime soon we will see a significant change of trend for the trend in Europe of the total economy and also all the beauty market it was rather flat last year and as far as I can see from what I read and what I\u2019m experiencing should be more or less in the same direction for the next year.","Now talking of our global efficiency plan as Patrice explained, this global efficiency plan basically is going to pass in two directions. Number one to generate resources to invest behind our key brands; two, generate growth, clearly growth is our number one priority. We are not happy with that business or with the modest growth business we want to accelerate this in order to achieve this we need to dedicate more resources behind our key brand as our launches. So the number one objective of this effort to find efficiencies across all organization need to provide the fuel to invest behind our brands and strategic initiatives to strengthen our growth.","Second, we are also generating opportunities to improve our profit given that our top-line growth is not at the moment in line with what we would like our growth here is very important to put a lot of focus on efficiency to ensure that we deliver on our strategic objective of expanding our margin even in a situation of low top-line growth and this plan will then pass in finding efficiencies and saving to allow us to reach our objectives.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please proceed.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Thanks, good morning. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color on advertising and marketing plans and initiatives in emerging markets. I think you talk quite regularly about the distribution partnerships, but I feel like we know a little bit less about how you're going to the market from a consumer standpoint? Thanks.","Michele Scannavini","","Okay. So first of all welcome back and congratulation.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","","Thank you so much.","Michele Scannavini","","So in terms of consumer investing in emerging market, let me say that the focus for us over the last I should say 12 to 18 months was to build the structure. So the key investment for us as being to be the growth market structure and distribution through partnership or through acquisition for instance in Southeast Asia. And the first step for us is that reaching the consumer and distributing our products. So we did not put a particular focus and pressure on A&P because the first objective was to reach a certain level of distribution.","Now going forward we plan to have level of A&P that these comparable to our level or A&P so we are not planning to over invest in the emerging markets also it is important to know that in most of the emerging market digital is a very strong and effective way to reach consumer and in some of the market the digital contract and use and reach is much, much higher for instance we have in Europe and digital is a very effective way of reaching consumer compared to traditional media. So basically summing up two steps, first to build the structure, to build distribution and then to start investing in those market at least in line with what we see in the remaining parts of the world.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi. Please proceed.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","","Hi, good morning. I have two questions. First of all, I don\u2019t think you offered guidance for the tax rate for next year, and I know there was a lot of variability this year, so if you could give us some sense of what to expect next year for that. But then my second question has to do with the destocking that we\u2019ve seen and just the fact that it\u2019s gone on so long and particularly with Wal-Mart when we\u2019ve seen it in other categories, it kind of happens for a quarter or two and then it\u2019s done. So my question is, have some of your retailers kind of permanently changed the way they view specifically the nail category? Have they taken like linear shelf facings away from the category and is that contributed to destocking? Or has there been no reset and this is just month after month, quarter after quarter of consumer weakness? Thanks.","Michele Scannavini","","So, on the first part of your question on guidance on tax rates so we don\u2019t really give guidance on tax rate, however, what I can indicate to you is actually this year was very positive impacted by a one-off in the third quarter. So you should not take the adjusted effective tax rate of 19% as that we have in the fiscal \u201914, as the guidance for \u201915 so you should take more guidance which is in line with what we had in 2013 marginally improved.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","As far as destocking so how does the word destocking so how basically we are destocking basically clearly and let\u2019s take nail as an example it is a good example. This has been destocking was last year when we had this abrupt change of trend in the market. And this was the first big of effecting on inventory in line with consumption trend. Then consumption progressively kept on decelerating and quarter after quarter the decline became bigger so the retailer progressively had to adjust and we adjusted that inventory to the consumption trend. It\u2019s also true as I said in my script that because of the negative trend in particularly in the second half of the year some promotion was locked in our case the year before to the nail category where I will take the other two categories with the last year trend. So there was not really an effecting of the nail set of the wall but was more the promotion was locked that was indicated to the category the work sheet to other categories.","Now so these are the situations generally speaking also I believe that the quarter four was somehow worst that the retail effecting and I believe that several retailer to be ready in good shape for back to school and for the holiday season has to manage their inventory down in order to have a clean situation with the start of the year. Now my or let me say hope looking to the first weeks of the fiscal year talking of nail is that the stronger success of Sally Hansen, innovation in Sally Hansen, is important not just because of it\u2019s a category leader it makes around in the last reading 37%, 38% of the total market. The success will bring back retailer attention interest to the category. We have seen that the market from double digit decline in the last period was -- it was a low single digit decline so it\u2019s not a growth but it\u2019s a better situation. And if then continues like that I am pretty confident that the retailer will get back to bring focus on the category and focus means also more promotional opportunity to develop the business.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question will come from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","Guys, I was hoping that you could help to reconcile the fiscal 2015 top-line guidance. You've said modest growth for the first half of the year I guess which is precisely when the comparisons are very, very easy. And that implies acceleration in the back half of 2015, when the comps get progressively more difficult. So you are really assuming a pretty big underlying acceleration if it works out to only modest growth in the first half. So I was hoping, especially considering you are saying nail has already picked up a little in the first six weeks tentatively, can you talk about why you would see such a big underlying acceleration through the year, and why even, on really easy comps, growth would be so modest in that first half of the year?","","Michele Scannavini","Okay, so thanks for the question that tell me to expand a bit more on our crucial outlook for the first half of the year. So, number one as I was explaining before, the category where we have the core of our business that are fragrances mass and prestige and color cosmetic and nail in mass still see a rather soft market situation. So, both in the consolidated countries mostly we are not anticipating a significant change of the trend discounts on the back of quarter four there was rather slow rather soft. So as I said before this is triggering very, very crucial attitude of retailer and I should particularly mass in manage inventory at placing replenishment toward. So this is clearly the first reason why we are looking at the next few months with a very cautious attitude.","Now two, we had over the last few months and particular in the U.S. a retail performance that was not good enough so we need to restore confidence on certain of our brands. Now I am encouraged to see that in July not only on color and the nail but also in fragrance we see some very positive sign and some improvement in market share. So this will help and then we will continue to deliver this result to contributor accelerated growth trend in the second part of the year, number three, there is also situation on the emerging markets.","Now in emerging markets we are growing very nicely and keep on planning to growth. But it\u2019s still that there are some situations, there is some concern for two reasons, one for social and political turmoil, I am referring mostly the Middle East, Russia and some Eastern Country that is impacting in domestic consumption and particularly into our retail business. And number two for country like China where we are seeing a clear deceleration of consumption trend across different categories and we see that some distributor and wholesalers are rather heavy with their inventory. So all-in-all, I should say that when you see U.S., Europe and the emerging market, the short-term future doesn\u2019t induce a lot of optimism. That\u2019s why we are keeping our outlook for the first part of the year very cautious.","Operator","","The next question will come from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets ","On the global efficiency plan, could you give us what the savings and costs are for 2015, what the cash charges are, and if there is a change in the number of people at Coty, if that is planned as well? And then I have a housekeeping question. What was the year-end share count? Thanks","Michele Scannavini ","Okay. So thank you for your questions. On the first part of the question, so we don\u2019t really give any guidance and detail on this program by year. However, I can give you a couple of indications. So first as you know, this program is comprised of three parts. First one is China and as you know, we said that the annual savings that we would expect from the China reorganization would be north of $20 million. Clearly the bulk of this will sit in fiscal \u201915. Second we have the productivity program and also what we have indicated on the productivity program is that the savings that we would expect exiting fiscal \u201915 would be a $45 million. So I think you can take this into account. But as far as the $120 million of the third leg of the comprehensive global efficiency plan, what I can indicate to you is that clearly we are kicking up this program early summer. As a result of that the first half impact will be a minimal if any and we will get some impact in the second half of the year but clearly the program is going to gain much more momentum in fiscal \u201916 and fiscal \u201917. Now as far as the share count is concerned, and at the end of the fiscal \u201914, so June 30, we had 354 million shares. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Please proceed.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus","Ad spend, so that amount has increased in recent quarters yet and revenue growth remains a little weaker than expected, and I know you talked a bit about expectations first half of the year, second half of the year. And maybe talk about it a little bit from a specific spend standpoint in that the response to revenue growth from the increased ad spend and sort of directionally thoughts about what you think the right levels need to be to drive that growth going forward?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","","Okay. So Michele said, starting second part of fiscal particularly last quarter, we have increased our A&P spend and actually you see already I believe the impact, the benefit of this looking at the initial sell through result over July and the beginning of August but we see most important and in fact there are some good reaction to our investment. Now clearly what is the cycle? The cycle is that you may behind our brand hopefully, you start improving your retail performance and your sell through. This is going to create more replenishment order and then you will see this impacting the sell-in. So there is always a lag, a time lag, of how the investment behind your brand is affected on your sell-in to the trade. On top of that there is the compensating factor as I explained before some destocking we see in the trade that is let me say reducing the replenishment more in this moment. But as I said before what we see in terms of market shares both in the U.S. and in Europe in the first part of the fiscal is encouraging and tell us that the increase investment behind our brand and started yielding fruit. ","Now in terms of what is the right level, so we always have that, we\u2019re thinking to move away to push our business is to invest between 23%, 24% of our sales actually in the last period we were close at the 23 which we were on lowest side of our rate and progressive we want to go to the high side of our range or even slightly above. Now the important thing is to think in terms of weight or in terms of spending because while it will increase spending we\u2019re also looking to how we can be more efficient in our spending both through improving our procurement capabilities so getting efficiency in our media buying that also related to the mix of the spending.","As I said before for instance digital that becomes more progressively each quarter and more important part all the spending behind the brand is more efficient way to reach the target with the special. So it means that you can get more targeted stronger weight within a more efficient spending. So we are working in the future in the two directions to increase significantly the weight, media weight, under our key brands and at the same time try to gain efficiencies both in our media mix and in our spending. So all-in-all we spend to grow some of the percentage but is really important the markets are going to be even higher it was where we see as a percentage on the season the P&L.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference.

My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, November 06, 2019. On today's call are Pierre Laubies, Chief Executive Officer; and Pierre-Andre Terisse, Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of the comments today may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to Coty's earnings release and the reports filed with the SEC, where the Company lists factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","All commentary are like-for-like in net revenue reflect the comparison of the business at constant currency in the current and prior year, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflects certain adjustments as specified in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Laubies.","Pierre Laubies","Thank you, Maria. And welcome everybody to Coty's first quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. I will start by reviewing the progresses we have made on our turnaround plan in the last few months and Pierre-Andre will then discuss our financial results, outlook and some of the recent strategic developments.","Our Q1 can be characterized by several key developments. First, we have begun activating our turnaround plan announced on July 1. Second, our operational and financial results illustrate that we are off to a solid start for the year and that we are showing improvement on the parameters that we seek to drive. And third, we remain confident in the fiscal 2020 targets we laid out on the last earnings call.","As a reminder, we built our turnaround plan aimed at serving what we consider our most pressing issues. More specifically, we were talking of the need to redress the trajectory of our Consumer Beauty business, retain the high performance levels of our Luxury and Professional Beauty businesses, close our margin gap against our peers, reconcile our organizational design and our size, and build an engaging culture relying less on personal genius and more on collective mastery [ph].","Four months into the activation of our plan, we are tackling each of these areas one by one. To begin stabilizing our plans in Consumer Beauty, we have been refocusing our teams on the most pressing fundamentals, namely our working media strategies. In Q1 working media spend increased 11% with the biggest step up behind Consumer Beauty brands. Within Consumer Beauty, we are actively focusing our resources behind our priority brand country combinations, leading to an investment increase of close to 40% on the strategic priorities.","We are also returning, as you may have noticed with the recent announcement on Cover Girl to a marketing strategy bolted on our strongest distinctive brand assets. We are also beginning to address our gross margin gap in several ways. First and foremost, we are now making sure that we have the best possible alignment between sell-in and sell-out thus avoiding value destructive selling tactics.","Two, our plans include least price increases where relevant which have already been or as we speak are being activated in several countries. Finally, we are advancing in our objectives to be the leaner and more aligned organization supported by an enabling [ph] culture with the right balance of key activity and discipline. We have defined our new organizational culture and have been communicating it for the core functions and in market.","We are currently actively allocating externally and internally for our new Amsterdam headquarters which will be ready by Q4, and we have recently named Richard Jones our Global Chief Supply Officer. Richard joined us with extensive experience in the beauty industry and is a key addition to our leadership team to lead our core [ph] and SKUs simplification agenda.","To build further on the progress we have made our [indiscernible] approach to defining market turn on plans has now covered approximately 50% of our business. This includes Consumer Beauty U.S., UK, Germany and Brazil, as well as Luxury UK and an overall review of the philosophy brand.","In these markets we have arrived at core findings identified the value at stake and have begun deploying action plans. This analytical approach is now being deployed in Consumer Beauty Russia, Poland and Canada, as well as Luxury U.S. and Germany, where we expect many of the same findings and conclusions. Our remaining markets will be covered in the next 12 to 18 months.","Although we are still in the early stages of activating our plans, we are beginning to see some green shoots in our operational performance. In the UK, where we remain the number one cosmetics, mass cosmetics plan had experienced market share erosions. Our actions have driven 200 basis points improvement in sales trends driving market share gains.","Behind these improvements are substantial increase in working media investment, particularly TV. The strong performance of recent launches, Wonderluxe Mascara, and Lasting Matte foundation, both of which were launched at premium pricing, and while it is still early, the limited demand elasticity we are experiencing following our recent pricing actions are in line with our expectations.","In Germany, we are mainly seeing many of different dynamics in the Mass Fragrance category. Bruno Banani, the number one Mass Fragrance brand in the market has also significantly increased its sell-out performance from a moderate decline to a double-digit growth, fueling the growth and the strong performance of the recently launched Loyal Man fragrance, increased media support for both the male and female lines, and the successful expansion of the brand into the shower gels category through product launch. ","In the U.S. we have also seen some early positive signals, though we are clear that the path to stabilization will take some time. Sally Hansen, the number one nail brand in the U.S. mass market has struggled with sales declines for several years. Our analytical approach identified across our brands of mass focus on as well as the key lever to drive consumer engagement.","Investment months we had increased our digital media support for the premium Miracle Gel line, improved the packaging on our treatment products range and deployed seasonally relevant in-store displays including a Halloween theme in [indiscernible] collaboration. As a result, while the mass men market continued to moderately decline, both Sally Hansen nail color and nail treatment are back to steady growth.","And in Cover Girl, while the improvement in the overall brand sell-out has been more moderate, our actions plans are transforming performance in key areas. Our core eight sub-brands which account for two-thirds of the brand sales are now back to growth marking a 320 basis points improvement. Underpinning this improvement is a strong [indiscernible] in TV support, so we're behind these sub-brands. And while our sales continue to be weighed on by the shelf space correction, we are seeing productivity improvement in our core customers as well as sales growth in uncut [ph] channels such as Amazon and Ultra [ph].","Speaking of Amazon, as we continue to focus on improving our fundamentals, both offline and online, we have seen very strong growth of our brands on Amazon, both in the U.S. and globally. The strong growth has been supported by our close collaboration with Amazon as part of the Global Vendor Management Program, the increased TV support for hero sub-brands, execution focus on core SKUs that were particularly weighed on Amazon. As a result, in Q1 our mass brands listed on Amazon grew over 40% and we now have our fair share on Amazon across most categories which is a substantial change for us.","In Luxury and Professional Beauty, we are continuing to deploy our strategies of premiumization and category expansion. In Luxury, [indiscernible] by Gucci's Alchemist Garden which remains amongst the top performing ultra premium collections and now we are planning our learning [ph] to support the launch of Chloe's Atelier des Fleurs. We are also seeing some success in extending our Luxury brand into the cosmetics category with our Q1 luxury makeup sales, three times the level of last year.","In Professional Beauty the team is continuing to drive conversion of leading salons to the premium Wella Koleston Perfect with ME+ line. And following the core principle of innovation, penetration, driving ghd has built on a strong positioning in traditional [indiscernible] to launch its very successful Glide hot brush. All of these positive signals give us confidence that we have the right brands, the right people, and the right action plans to steadily improve Coty's performance and unlock significant value.","With that, let me turn it over to Pierre-Andr\u00e9.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Thank you, Pierre and good morning to everyone. So I'll roll as you have seen our Q1 results, are line with expectation and solid start to the year. Starting with first line on like for like net revenue declined minus 1.1% which was way down significantly by the performance in Younique and saw progress in the scope, our net revenues were particularly stable at minus 0.1%. This was obviously partially helped by low comparables in Q1 last year, but it was nonetheless an improvement from the approximately minus 3% like for like decline on the same scopes excluding Younique, both at quarter and in full year 2019 overall.","So continuing the like for like performance we had a strong growth in Luxury in Professional Beauty and a sequential improvement in Consumer Beauty. As we focused on gross margin improvement and continued controlling costs, our adjusted operating income grew 10% resulting in 110 basis points of operating margin expansion. I will come back on that point in more details in a few minutes.","But first, I'll shift to, I'll go to the division results and start with Luxury. As you can see here on this slide the compare for the new Tiffany & the fragrance launch is expanding the branding to both male and female fragrances. Over the course of October the line has been exclusive to Bloomingdales in the U.S., but we are already seeing strong results. The sales of Tiffany on the very first day of launch exceeded an entire week of sales, of the initial Tiffany Signature fragrance launch and we're pleased to see that the quarter of the sales are coming from the male line speaking to the appeal of the Tiffany brand across vendors.","On the right of the screen, close on the heels of the launch of our Gucci lipsticks globally, we also have been re-launching the Burberry Makeup line focused on Asia-Pacific and the results have been very promising.","So if I move to Luxury financial performance then, in Q1 the dividend delivered another quarter of low to mid single digit growth. This included growth in Europe and ALMEA. In Luxury fragrance category that continues to grow in the low single digits including in the U.S. While our revenue growth was based in part by easier comparables, some of our sales were impacted by the protests in Hong Kong. This has been hampering our growth in the city and the surrounding travel retail corridor throughout the quarter.","From a brand perspective, we are seeing steady performance in our innovation. Both Gucci and Burberry Makeup continued to expand, contributing over a third of our divisional growth in the quarter. And this confirms a strong potential of several of our luxury fragrance brand to expand into adjacent Beauty category.","As I mentioned earlier, Tiffany & Love is off to a strong start. Gucci Memoire has been a solid addition to the expanding Gucci portfolio and Hugo Boss Bottled Infinite continued to be successful showing further distribution expansion. From a margin standpoint, Luxury drove strong gross margin improvement coupled with cost control and this resulted in over 300 basis points of operating margin improvements.","And now turning to Consumer Beauty, you can see on the next side a number of our recent successful initiatives. On the left of the screen is Lili Reinhart, an actress and celebrity with a strong following amongst Gen-Z consumers and she will be the new Cover Girl easy, breezy, beautiful ambassador. And the consumer response and engagement with these announcements has been quite positive.","For adidas, we are capitalizing on the strength of the sports brands with the launch of three new fragrances which are working well in markets. And as Pierre discussed already, Sally Hansen has significantly improved its momentum through a number of initiatives, including our Halloween nail [ph] correction and [indiscernible] in-store displays.","So let's turn now to the financial components of the division, for the quarter the like for like net revenues declined 7.8% improving from the minus 10% decline ex-Younique last quarter and in full year 2019. Europe reported sales results with a growth of net revenues reflecting incremental improvement in sell-out, so that's important.","In North America, the performance was mixed, but encouraging with Sally Hansen once again back to growth and noticeable improvements on the priority Cover Girl SKUs as already disclosed by Pierre. We expect such improvements to continue in the coming quarter as shelf [indiscernible] moderate and as our investments continue showing traction.","Last, we chose in most ALMEA countries for Consumer to drive healthy and sustainable sales foregoing margin dilutive low value sales and as a result, revenue declined in this region. In the division as in the rest of the group, we remain indeed focused on driving gross margin improvements and these results will allow us to free up gross margin dollars to reinvest in the business.","And so on this point, in Q1 we actively ramped up working media and redeployed it to our priority brands. With working major investments behind these brands up 38% in the quarter we saw a noticeable improvement in the strength of such sales which declined in low single digits in Q1 versus high single digit decline in full year in fiscal year 2019. So as expected, this is an increase in A&CP coupled to revenue decline drove a contraction in operating margin in Q1.","To and up on Consumer, while the performance of this division remains weak, this quarter has shown positive answer to our initiative and we look forward to more gradual improvements in the coming quarters.","And now shifting to Professional Beauty, ghd continued its strong momentum across core countries, aided by innovations such as the Glide hot brush and the Platinum Plus styler as you can see on the left and as Christmas is getting close you should really look at this as a gift idea for the people you really love, that's a great idea, so I recommend it.","On the right, you see that OPI also returned to strong growth supported by easier comparables and successful execution of some of our collection you see on the screen the Scottish collection. Talking about financials for the division, Professional Beauty returned to growth as expected, reporting a strong 5% like for like. We saw strong growth in Europe and North America partially have by low comparables in the case of the U.S. specifically. As expected, U.S. customer discounting that affected our sales in the second half of last year has run its course and we have been shipping in line with consumption.","The combination of this topline expansion and cost discipline drove over 400 basis points of operating margin expansion which stood at close to 10% for the quarter. So that's it for the division, I'm not going back to continue the whole. Key outcome of the beginning of this year is the changing shape of our P&L as we are seeing are actually focused on gross margin translating into results.","Gross margin in the quarter was up 160 basis points to 62% which was a strong improvement throughout the quarter. Consistent with our comments in August, we significantly increased working media in the quarter by 11% and this resulted in another increase of 70 basis points in our A&CP as we continue rationalizing our non-working media. This is a key outcome since it deals with year two's [ph] equation where growth margin progresses, finance investments behind our brands which will gradually help our revenues and in turn our gross margin.","It is also the main driver of growth of our operating income which was up 10% in Q1 or 110 basis points increase in terms of operating margin.","Last, or EPS ended at $0.07, which was down versus the $0.11 last year, which itself included $0.04 of non-recurring tax benefit and therefore absent from these tax benefits, the EPS has been stable.","And turning to cash flow statement, which as you know is a new performance element for us. While Q1 is always a seasonally weak period for cash generation, we did improve our free cash flow very meaningfully by $169 million year-over-year. This growth reflects strong underlying improvements in cash generation, as well as an additional $75 million from factoring.","Having closed the Younique divestiture in the quarter, we received $60 million of proceeds and at the same time repurchased the remaining stake in our Southeast Asia JV for $45 million, in total, aided by FX, our net debt and resultant leverage moved down moderately versus last quarter, to less than $7.4 billion for the debt.","So, I am now moving to Slide 18. In summary, Q1 was a solid delivery on our metric which was as well, a turning point in the management of our equation and a first milestone in the construction of our turnaround plan. This makes us confident for the rest of the year and we're happy to confirm our target for fiscal '20 at constant scope as said in the last earnings call.","In detail, that means like-for-like net revenues stable to slightly lower year-over-year and operating income at constant scope and constant currency growing 5% to 10%, or mid single-digit growth in the EPS and a moderate improvement in our free cash flow. We expect Q2 trends to be generally consistent with this growth algorithm.","To end up, let me remind you of an important decision, which we announced two weeks ago. While our turnaround plan is financing to building a better business and you have seen some first elements of delivery. We have with the Board come to the conclusion that we need to accelerate the transformation of Coty to increase our focus on core categories and to free up resources to invest behind these categories, namely fragrances, cosmetics and skin care.","And therefore, we decided to engage a strategic review of the Professional Beauty business, associated hair brands as well as the Brazilian operations. The teams in these businesses have done an incredible job of the tax-free use [ph] in creating strong platforms in their respective business. However, we believe we need to work to identify the best options for them with very simple objectives.","Number one, unlock shareholder value; number two, sharpen our focus on our fragrance, color cosmetics and skincare businesses and by doing so, reduce the complexity of our portfolio and with potential proceeds deleverage Coty with target pro forma leverage which we have fixed at around 3x.","We anticipate that the review will be completed by summer 2020. And I must say that we have already received multiple marks of interest, which I think says about the high attractiveness of these assets. After the stabilization of our supply chain as through the building of our turnaround plan, this is a key decision to accelerate the transformation of our company into a focused and competitive unique [ph] company.","That's the end of our opening comments. Thank you for your attention and let's now go through the questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you very much. I was just wondering --.","Pierre Laubies","Good morning.","Robert Ottenstein","Good morning. I was just wondering if you can maybe just help us understand a little bit more of why selling Professional is strategic imperative, great business, important cash flow generator. I think we were a little surprised to hear about how you're thinking about it. So just really trying to understand, in a little bit more depth, kind of the thinking around that? And then once assuming that happens, maybe give us a little bit of sense of any issues in terms of stranded costs or scale issues that could result from the sale?","And then finally, along those lines, what that does to your kind of expected medium term algorithm, whether the kind of targets that you have for fiscal 2020 would make sense as a medium term algorithm after that divestiture? Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","Okay. I'll hand it over to Pierre-Andre.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","I think the reasoning is very simple. We have three great categories. We believe in each of them, but we also believe that each of them has a lot of potential and we need to be able to put the means, human and financial behind each of them to develop them. We don't believe at the moment we would be in the best position to manage the three at the same time for reasons which has to do with leverage on the one hand and for reasons which has to do with complexity of and focus on the others.","So, we've chosen to focus on two segments, which are Luxury and Consumer which in reality category-wise are fragrances, cosmetics and skincare because we believe by focusing on these categories and only these categories, we can grow faster in creating value with them and we can sharpen our focus and transform the group actually. At the same time, we believe that by putting the Professional business, the Hair business and, the Brazilian business in a different context that's going to give these businesses as well, the means, it needs to, they need to develop.","So it's, yes, it's really a matter of focusing of giving ourselves more attention to the categories we've chosen, freeing up financial needs as well recovering financial flexibility to invest behind those and this is we believe the way we are going to maximize the value creation for our shareholders.","With respect to stranded costs, this is something we'll have to deal with but we are not overly worried for couple of reasons, the main one being that most of the turnaround plan efforts have been focusing on Consumer Beauty and Luxury and therefore the essence of the plan is going to remain on the sub-base [ph] and we think that's going to be definitely allowing us to deliver the target we achieved for ourselves at the time, which was 14% to 15% operating margin, and which we have confirmed recently. So essentially, it doesn't change our target in terms of gross margin and operating margin improvements, and we hope it is going to help us accelerate the transformation of the Group.","Robert Ottenstein","And in terms of the algorithm, what do you see is a good medium term algorithm ex-divestitures?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","What do you mean by algorithm?","Robert Ottenstein","Well, just in terms of expected topline growth, operating profit growth, EPS growth as, you know, the kind of targets that you gave for fiscal 2020?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Okay. So we are opening a strategic review and I think it's a bit early days to talk about all that. What we are confident about is our ability to deliver substantial margin improvement and to target the 14% to 16% and then for the rest we need to work.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great, thanks, good morning. First question is just on Luxury, if you could just break down the performance a bit, because it decelerated despite comping against a period where you had some supply chain issue. So are there still old disruptions you're working through because since there might be underlying categories changed much, particularly in fragrances? And then if you could just talk about your exposure to Hong Kong and travel retail there that would be great? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yes, I can, I can take it and Pierre can again complement. Its true Luxury had a favorable base, so that's why - the way to read the focus into that is, it's very strong, it's a strong performance, but at the same time it reflects easy comps and the Hong Kong and travel retail impact I have been mentioning. And so if you turn to Q2, you would expect the reverse, you would expect that the comps are going to be much higher. And therefore, probably Luxury is going to be low-single digit growth in this particular quarter. We continue seeing fundamentally positive drivers of performance in the fragrance in the expansion to cosmetics and at the same time, we have this situation in Asia, which is likely to continue impacting us for a few quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC.","Nik Modi","Hi, good morning everyone. Two quick questions from me, first, I just want to make sure I heard it right that your second quarter outlook is in line with the full year and I thought I heard that, but I just wanted to confirm that. And just given how important the December quarter is for the Beauty business in general, just any more clarity or specifics you can give us on kind of how you're thinking about that season would be very helpful in terms of selling of new products or programs or anything that would give us a little bit more clarity?","And then the second question is, just bigger picture question on make-up, obviously a lot of companies have been struggling in this area. I just wanted to get your views on what you see going on in that market. Do you think it's something that can be turned around? Is it really just a function of a cyclical change between skincare and makeup that tends to go every three to five years, any thoughts around that would be helpful?","Pierre Laubies","Hi Nik, this is Pierre. I'll take the last question first and then Pierre-Andre will take the other ones. I think our vision on the makeup is that probably, there has been a bit of bench [ph] timing, if I may say so and I think we probably are in a normal cycle of multiplication of purchase by consumer, the category has massed out in probably any type of penetration and probably increase penetration by going to lower ranges, younger ages, sorry. But we do think that clearly we have seen a bad developing [ph] case of quantity of purchase over the years, and I think we are cycling through that.","We also, I think, have ourselves in the middle of channel, which are not measured in the typical panel and like, we are talking of the online business and if I assume that if we have such a good performances and as well we may not be the only one having that performance, and as a consequence, I think alternative channels are also taking their fair share, yes.","So I think probably the shift in channel is, plays a role here, in the official data that we see, and probably are going through, I would call it an accelerated cycle of purchase over the last two years, which we need to cycle through, but we do think that the category still has potential and particularly we really believe that the category has, or we have potential in the Luxury side of these categories.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Hi Nik, Andre. So on the new launches, there are a couple of things, we've already mentioned, Tiffany & Love, which is really a Q2, going to be a Q2 event, which is off to a strong start as you have seen. We have in addition Gucci Bloom Ambrosia and the first signs we have are pretty positive in the U.S. and in the UK, but these are very early days.","We have Burberry Her Eau de Parfum, which is adding to the range of Burberry for hair. We have as well two shades of glitzy lipstick for Gucci which are going to come in addition and widen the range and that is for Luxury. So we are -- we continue coming with innovation on the market.","With respect to Q2 and what we expect, so you all know that the base of comparison, in particular for Luxury and TV was low this quarter and therefore, you would expect to have still a solid and pretty good performance of these two businesses next quarter, but probably being on the higher base level. And at the same time, we expect to see continuing progress in Consumer Beauty.","So if I look at the consensus now on net revenues, I would say that we are comfortable with that. On the operating income for H1 given the strong start, which further is attributable to phasing [ph] elements. I would see the OI up in the low part of the range we have given for the year, which means about mid single-digit. So Q2, which will be on a different day is very much in the continuation of what we are showing in Q1 and we've -- reflecting a substantial improvement in the business.","Nik Modi","Thank you very much.","Pierre Laubies","Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","Yes, hi, good morning. So, a couple of questions.","Pierre Laubies","Hi, Faiza.","Faiza Alwy","Hi, so, first, I just wanted to understand sort of why did you decide to include Brazil and as part of your strategic review, because I thought that business was doing reasonably well relative to the rest of Consumer Beauty? And so I just wanted to clarify how much that Brazil and the retail hair care business contribute to growth this quarter on an organic basis?","And then, I also just wanted to ask about gross margin and was hoping that you could disaggregate for us the margin increase here because I think last quarter you had sort of the higher incremental freight costs because of the supply chain issues. So I was wondering if we could get an underlying growth rate excluding that, and if possible sort of a break down between mix, if there was any contribution from lower promotions, any contribution from productivity, cost cutting and synergies? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Okay, I'll take these questions -- number of questions. Maybe about the gross margin element, so strong progress in Luxury for the quarter, strong progress in Professional Beauty as well for the quarter; in Consumer Beauty, it's been mix, pretty different from one market to the other. ALMEA for the reasons I mentioned, which is that we have chosen to give the priority to gross margin, and really to the [indiscernible] on sales, we are negative [ph] but we have a strong rebound on the gross margin.","Europe depends very much market-by-market, overall exactly negative and so is the case of the Americas. So Consumer Beauty as a whole is pretty contracted. These different, very different movements and dynamics market-by-market, I think it's important we try not to manage consumer as a whole, but really to address the specific situation of each market.","On Brazil, well, the reasoning is very simple. Once you eliminate hair, hair is a substantial part of Brazil, as well as mass products and the other ones in particular and, therefore, Brazil in this perimeter, in this release portfolio was not really fitting in our portfolio, so we thought it was natural for Brazil to go with professional and hair in this strategic review and not for reason of performance because the performance of both Brazil and the rest of the scope on the review is positive.","So, I mean, it's really not a question of getting rid of businesses, which are not performing well, it is more of a question of having the right level of focus to invest our resources where we think we can generate more results.","And on your question of what's been doing what on the quarter, the scope which is under strategic review was positive low single-digits and the scope which is not under strategic review, I think, is fewer single-digit. I hope has been complete. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo.","Joe Lachky","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to get back to the strategic options review that you're doing and I guess, first of, on the timing of it, because four months ago, you guys presented plans, after doing a thorough review of the business. So I'm wondering what's really changed and what's driving the need to accelerate change given the confidence that you had four months ago in the turnaround plan and who is really driving the decision to do that? Is it the management team? Is it the Board or the primary shareholder? Can you shed a little light on that? Thanks.","Pierre Laubies","Hi. Well, I mean you're right on something which is that we go fast. Pierre has been in the business for about a year. I think the business for about nine months. I mean in this period of time we have solved the supply chain issues and we have stabilized the business in '19, then we have produced a turnaround plan and now we are talking the strategic review. So that's a lot of thinking. One year, I think that's just made necessary if we want to reshape Coty and to transform it into a performing beauty company and beauty Champions. I don't think there was any change.","I once said that we had to take things one by one and not to try and do everything at the same time. So that's really the methodology we follow. We had to stabilize the company and solve the supply chain issues, that was done. We had to stabilize '19 and to deliver '19, that was done.","We definitely had to look at a plan to close the performance gap of all of our businesses and that's what we've tried to do with the turnaround plan and once we've done that, we started looking at the portfolio and thinking, is there any way we can improve faster, we can make faster the transformation of the Group and improve faster our performance and obviously a key element was our ability to free up resources, human and financial behind core categories, and this is why we have made this decision, so no change.","A diagnostic from the management, which has been shared with the Board and fully supported by the Board, there is not one company, and another one, there is only one company with management in both and we have taken this decision together. That's fundamentally it.","Joe Lachky","And then, if you can maybe talk about if you have any expectations for proceeds, is there a hurdle level in mind where you could potentially walk away from doing a deal and hold on to the businesses? And then maybe if you could talk just generally, I know it's early, but generally about like potential uses of the proceeds, how they could potentially be allocated between debt repayment and share repurchases? And along those lines, would you do a deal that could be dilutive to EPS in order to hit your leverage target of 3x?","Pierre Laubies","Well, I won't comment on the last one. Again it is too early days. In terms of expectations, the only thing I can say is that these businesses are incredibly attractive whether you focus Professional Beauty which for many, many reasons, the hair business is one of the leading platform in the world and has been performing well, and has been strengthened for the past few years by the management.","OPI which is an outstanding brand, GHD which is literally flying in terms of growth and Brazil, which is a unique pleasure on the Brazilian market, which is, as you would recall, a very attractive market in the Beauty space. So, we have expectations, which basically match the attractiveness of these assets, and I will not comment further on that.","On the potential use of proceeds, we've been pretty clear, I think, in the press release saying that the potential proceeds would be used to decrease the indebtedness with a target leverage of about 3x net debt to EBITDA and any excess will be returned to shareholders. So, I have got nothing to add to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks, good morning.","Pierre Laubies","Hi, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","Hi. So I wanted to ask again about Consumer Beauty margins, I know you touched on it already, but I was intrigued by you saying you're not going to manage holistically, but more thinking about the specific situation of each market. So with that in mind, when you said that for ALMEA, where you have really decided to start to prioritize gross margins more dramatically, sales were down.","So when I think about the situation in the U.S. and promotional intensity and things that you've talked about trying -- needing to start to correct, how does that play out? Look, if I think about the trajectory for Consumer Beauty in the U.S., is there a point in time, somewhere in the next, I don't know 12 months, 18 months when we see more pressure on sales because that focus switches to be more about gross margins?","Pierre Laubies","Hi Lauren, this is Pierre. How are you? The - I think I'll come back to that point at the end of the day, it's first and foremost our strategy is to raise the gross margin and we raised the gross margin by combination of the deal [ph] that is really competitive on the promotion, but do not be overly competitive. So clearly, we do understand that there is a [indiscernible] promotional intensity that you need to respect. So we are going to be in line with what we think should be the level of promotion in the market, but certainly what we believe is that we have not exhorted pricing power on our products over the course of the last five years, and it is time to return to that, right?","And so, we do know that we have all the math in order. We do clearly understand that there is some necessity and we are ready to accept some of these volume losses associated with that because we think it is very important that we generate the gross margin, which will enable us to increase the velocity of our brands by advertising and I think that model, I - we are convinced that this model will work and we are going to execute [ph] it.","The second thing well into work to improve our gross margin is to really simplify our portfolio, simplify our brands, and make sure that the SKUs, which are penetration drivers and are also in general high margin SKUs, these obviously get the shelving that they deserve and being working on the shelf for six elements, four elements, two elements or one element.","And I think it is, there is a lot of tackling and blocking there to be done, but actually, I do believe that we can both at the same time play by the rule of the game of the promotional intensity, which we require but not over and at the same time, raise our gross margin by balancing the mix over time.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink of Jefferies.","Stephanie Wissink","Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to just focus on the work media, I want to make sure I have the statistics right here. So I think you mentioned core brand investment in working media was up about 38%. Can you help us understand what percentage of the business falls into that priority or core brand mix, and then also tell us a little bit about where some of those media dollars are going. I know you mentioned TV, but if there any other areas of emphasis in terms of your media mix, that would be helpful?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Media mix is established by our reach based strategy and as a consequence, we apply the media mix that we need to apply based on the - again the specific complex situation where you have countries where you can use, you need to have a balance between - adjusted balance in term of online versus regular TV and due to the penetration of digital and all the companies where the penetration of digital is lower, and as a consequence, you do more mainstream media.","So that's, and even in some countries, you can do - you will do a general balances with take or shop [ph]. If you look at the most [indiscernible] you already to be massively investing into digital versus the rest of the company, you are going to invest in key. So, I think we tailor-made this media plan market by market and there is not a one size fits all strategy. So that's one of the field drivers.","The second thing [indiscernible] at this stage or it is called, DMUs, if we call them by market intersection will present on which we are focusing this media effort point [ph] about 60% of all the news and they tend to be also our biggest global brands. Over time, we do want to continue to be exposed to increase that because we still have gaps to close in term of media investment in a certain number of market and this is why the job that I was relating to earlier on gross margin is absolutely important, as well as the balance between working media and non-working media, we still can be improved at Coty.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks, good morning everybody. Two --","Pierre Laubies","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Astrachan","Good morning. One, on the pricing commentary. So is this something that it's more of a one-time repositioning of product pricing, is it something that you want to use as a lever on a more ongoing basis kind of an inflation plus kind of curious on that? And then secondly back on the potential asset sales, I realize, it's obviously early and this is kind of a second debt, if you will, the implication of what you said about leverage would imply redeploying proceeds assuming multiples or value that we all kind of believe is reasonable for the business.","So maybe holistically, if you could talk a bit about what you would do with cash, where are you unencumbered by the current debt levels, that would be kind of helpful and just hearing your thoughts there?","Pierre Laubies","Hi, Mark. I'll take the pricing decision, this is Pierre, or the pricing question sorry. I think both of the above will be line sale [ph]. Yes, we have a catch-up plan to do and we are executing our catch up plan. We have not taken pricing for many years and it has depleted our ability to - it has depleted our gross margin. And as a consequence, as we can all plan [ph] and as a consequence has unfortunately led us to increase promotional intensity.","So we need to get out of this virtual circle [ph] to get back into a virtual circle and then at this stage we, this is why we do think that we need to have a bit of a reset, right, and then going forward, indeed you are absolutely, right. We need to make sure that we manage inflation correctly and we do not fall back into this trap we have fallen into.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","And Pierre-Andre here, I think it's really a matter of - it's a matter of trade offs and financial flexibility, trade off, we have debt level which given the recent evolution of the business has led us to make our trade offs in favor of cash as opposed to in favor of brand investment and profits by the way.","So, I think, by coming back to leverage level, which is more additive to the industry and category, we are putting ourselves in a position to make ourselves in a position to make better trade-offs overall, which sometimes will still be in favor of cash but sometime will be in favor of growth and then altogether that's giving us more financial flexibility and more financial flexibility means that with two categories which offers a lot of possibilities of growth.","We would have the ability to invest if and when in front of the right opportunity. So, yeah, I would say overall that's definitely an improvement in order to grow the business we have chosen to - we have chosen to keep.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning. My first question has to do with the comments you made about selling on Amazon and the great growth that you're seeing there and you're one of the few beauty companies who talks about that. So, I was curious on why do you think that is? Are you doing extra promotion on Amazon? Can you talk about what your margins look like on Amazon selling to Amazon versus selling to traditional retail?","And then my second question just on the divestitures. I mean, I was stunned to see the price, the proceeds you've got for Younique. I mean one-tenth of what you paid is kind of stunning and I am a little bit worried that that sends a signal to potential buyers for professional, hair care, the Brazilian business that you're in kind of fire sale mode and you will sell these assets for anything. So, was Younique like a one-off situation, you just wanted out or was it really that bad of business? I mean, maybe you could just comment on how much discipline you're going to show in terms of the proceeds you will get for these businesses? Thanks.","Pierre Laubies","I'll take the first part of the question and I will have Pierre-Andre answer on the second one. Why are we going on Amazon? Mostly because we are playing on Amazon and the strategy that we aim at applying into [indiscernible] retail or the mass market, we clearly know now what our core SKUs are, we know what our high velocity items, which are penetration billing items are and we are making sure that they get their fair share on Amazon, as a consequence the business is growing.","So, we have an absolute coalition between the job that we have been doing and these markets that we have identified UK, US, Germany and Brazil and what we are doing on Amazon. And the benefit is definitely with online. I mean the implementation of the situation of that strategy works faster and the ability to expand your assortment or the ability to adapt your assortment is just more high-speed [ph] and as a consequence we get this result and also we have put resources behind it which probably, we haven't been necessarily putting before, and our margin is up from the metrics seen ago.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","So we are not, absolutely not in a fire sale mode. I think Younique, you will understand, was a very specific case and not to use the Younique word of course. It's a business, which was far away from our competencies, which we have been struggling to manage for the past few quarters now with very difficult performance and at some stage we just chose to move on. And we chose to move on and to divest it in conditions which I agree are not very good looking, but at the same time, we thought it was very important for the rest of Coty that we could move on and as we put this program on the side knowing that Derek [ph] will be managing us much better than we have done together.","So that's a choice we made, again not being in a fire sale mode, what we are doing now with our strategic review is completely different. Of course, we are talking of an asset which has not been losing [indiscernible], and we are talking of an asset, which is performing well.","You see this quarter, this is a case of Professional Beauty, this is a case hair, this is a case of OPI, GHD, Brazil, we are looking at brands, which are recognized by many, many people, Professional as a sector, but also by many investors, which attract a lot of interest, which was not the case of Younique.","These are brands, which have a fairly good level of profitability improving. PB [ph] was 12% last year, OI and that's a good proxy for the overall group. So if you should take into account the current costs, which are going to remain for about at Coty, we are talking of the scope, which has a mid teens operating income.","So, given what I said about the profitability of other growth given the obvious appetite, which we see and which I'm sure you can see, we expect this transaction to be creating a lot of value, actually, just creating a lot of value and we are going to make sure that this is, attaining [ph] this way. It's really about extenuating value for the Group and reshaping Coty in a much more substantial way than Younique which was very different small case.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JP Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. So, just as a final question, sorry, a couple of clarifications. One is for the Q2 guide, when you mentioned, first half, did you mean the first half operating profit would be up mid single or were you referring just to Q2, specifically? The second one was on the expectation of the proceeds from the sale of the assets, I mean, I think that $8 billion to $9 billion from [indiscernible], you talked about implies about 20x to 21x EBITDA. So, as a follow-up just to see if from - you think that could be feasible from what you just mentioned about not being on a fire sale?","And then on the marketing spending, sorry, the third one would be, you said working media was up 11%. But can you comment about the whole A&P [ph] because I understand you were taking down couponing [ph]. So in the couponing, on the total A&P spending is still down, relatively, I think it is still down. So I want to just double check that and also how a like-for-like, I understand that you do on a net basis, how would like-for-like would have been without the reduction in couponing? Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","Okay. Pierre-Andre, I'll take these, I think I will take these questions. On A&CP first, it's up 70 basis points altogether. So 11% is increase of the working media, but the total entity is up 70 basis points. It's been open and you will continue growing growth and we believe it's important that we keep reinvesting altogether and therefore we will invest or invest - we will increase our investments in A&CP.","On the guidance for in Q2 - on the guidance for the full year, operating income, so I said mid-single digit for H1 and therefore, that includes the Q1, which has been specifically strong with some selling, as I said, but altogether H1 is going to be up, we expect it to be up mid single digits, so within the range we have given for the year in the rest half, the range or part of the range. And then from the proceeds, we didn't say it is a $9 billion. That was I think an information in the press in the Financial Times, if I'm not mistaken.","Now clearly that's going to be a sizable transaction. You know how much we're talking about in terms of earnings, I've give you some analysis about that. You know how strategic transaction can price on the market where it's kind of multiple it can attract and therefore you can make the math, it's going to be a sizable transaction, and we don't want to speculate on the amount, that's far too - that's far too early, but we believe it is going to be a sizeable one.","I think that is it. We'll conclude the call now. Thank you very much for your attention. It's exciting time at Coty, exciting to see the progress we are making and we look forward to sharing more progresses with you next quarter in February. Thank you, bye.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"6335":["Coty Inc.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. ","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 21st. On the calls today are Camillo Pane, Chief Executive Officer; and Patrice de Talhouet, Executive Vice President, and Global Chief Financial Officer. Also joining the call is Christina Frank, who recently joined Coty as the Head of Investor Relations.","I would like to remind you that many of the comments today may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to Coty's press release and the reports filed with the SEC for the company list factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.","All commentary on organic net revenue reflect the comparison of legacy Coty and the P&G Beauty business on a combined net revenue basis at constant currency and in current and prior year period, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty business.","In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our earnings release.

I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Pane.","Camillo Pane","Thank you, Candice, and welcome everybody to Coty's fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full-year conference call. 2018 was a year of good progress for Coty as we stabilized the overall business and continued with our ambitious integration agenda. We have delivered our target of modest organic revenue growth and a very healthy improvement in the adjusted operating margin in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, much remains to be done, and I would like to use this call as an opportunity to not just review the results, but also remind you of our earnings model and the strategic framework that will guide us going forward.","The Luxury division fired on all cylinders in fiscal 2018 and had a great year with 6% like-for-like growth, driven by strength in all regions and travel retail. The division growth was fueled by the Gucci Bloom and Tiffany launches, strong performance by the Calvin Klein and philosophy brands, and excellent innovation and recent share gains with the launch of Chloe Nomade and Marc Jacob's Daisy Love. We're particularly excited about the growth in ALMEA, with terrific performances in China and Latin America.","As you know, we added Burberry to the Luxury portfolio this year and we are very pleased with the progress to date and confident about the brands' future. Less than nine months after the acquisition of the license, we are launching Burberry Her, a brand-new fragrance centered on the London vibe. We've also made significant progress in bringing the Burberry distribution in-house. And fiscal 2019 will be a year continuing to normalize customer inventories, while aiming a strong growth in emerging markets.","Fiscal 2018 was a solid year for the Professional Beauty division, with like-for-like growth of 1.7%, including very strong momentum in the ALMEA region and with key brands like Wella and OPI, despite the disruption in one of our North American warehouses. OPI growth was driven by very strong performance by GelColor, while Wella was fueled by the continued strength of our Color portfolio and by the WellaPlex launch.","In fiscal 2018, our Consumer Beauty revenues declined 4% on a like-for-like basis, an improvement from negative 10% in fiscal 2017. Consumer Beauty Europe and North America regions declined mid-to-high single digits against the backdrop of low single digit declines in the mass beauty category in these regions, aggressive competitive activity and supply chain disruption, due to the consolidation of the planning center at the end of Q4 2018.","The ALMEA region was stable, had stronger high-single digit to double-digit net revenue growth in most markets, was offset by decline in Brazil, due to our intervention on inventory pricing, as well as the recent trucker strike. Brazil continues to show share gains and is growing more than double the industry rate and this continues even in the second half of fiscal 2018 following our price increases. Overall, I remain unsatisfied with the current performance with the Consumer Beauty division and this will remain one of my key priorities.","Now let's turn to the future. As described in our press release, we\u2019re now focused on enhancing operating profit growth by delivering the remaining cost synergies and returning the business to low-single digits like-for-like net revenue growth. This level of top line growth combined with our ongoing focus on reducing cost even after the synergies are fully delivered, underpins our medium-term target of achieving a high-teens adjusted operating margin over the next five years.","We believe that each of our divisions play a unique role in helping us to deliver this margin structure and profit growth. Specifically, we look for Luxury to sustain its above market top expansion, fueled by our strong innovation capabilities, geographic expansion, and ongoing development of our Prestige skincare and color cosmetics offerings.","In Professional Beauty, we look to accelerate our growth by maximizing the untapped potential of OPI and ghd, while capitalizing on Wella's market leading position. In Consumer Beauty, we aim to standardize the division top line and improve the bottom line and I will get into further detail shortly.","Against this backdrop, we view fiscal 2019 as an important step in the right direction to achieve our medium-term ambitions. For fiscal 2019, we're targeting well over 100 basis points of operating margin expansion, which combined with our target of flat to modest like-for-like net revenue growth would deliver mid-teens adjusted operating income growth and in fiscal 2019, adjusted EPS target of $0.74 to $0.78.","We believe key drivers to achieve these targets are the delivery of the announced cost synergies, continued strong growth in Luxury and Professional Beauty, and progress towards the stabilization of Consumer Beauty.","I will now outline the strategic framework that will drive our top line performance, and Patrice will discuss the synergies and profit in more details in his section. Our strategy to drive growth is focused on four distinct pillars, which are all equally relevant for all the three divisions. It includes focusing on brands which matter and have potential, on driving innovation in-store execution much harder, on digital transformation and on rapid expansion in the emerging ALMEA markets.","On the first point, we will continue to drive the potential longevity of our global iconic brands, such as COVERGIRL, Wella, Clairol, and Rimmel in Consumer Beauty, Wella Professionals in Professional Beauty, and Gucci, Calvin Klein, Burberry and Hugo Boss in Luxury.","In addition, we will focus on driving brands that we believe have high growth potential, including Bourjois, Younique in Consumer Beauty, OPI and ghd in Professional Beauty, and Chloe, Marc Jacobs Botegga Veneta and Tiffany in Luxury. We are pleased to say that the strength of these brands coupled with our disproportionate investment behind them has enabled this group to outperform and our target is to further enhance this outperformance. ","We have improved and will continue to improve our innovation pipeline and made progress with our in-store execution strategy. Key examples are the partnership with third-parties to shorten our time to market on innovation, especially in countries like China, where localization is a key priority. And the launch of a highly select number of flagship brand stores for Bourjois, Philosophy, and Gucci Beauty where consumers can connect with our brand DNA and products.","Our recently improved the store execution of COVERGIRL in the U.S. is another example. Alongside our plans to rejuvenate our core business, we're equally focused on our digital transformation and I'm pleased to confirm that we're making great progress towards our goals.","In fiscal year 2018, e-commerce accounted for approximately 10% of our total net revenues, including Younique. Excluding Younique, which is an entirely e-commerce driven business, e-commerce net revenue grew more than 50% year-over-year. I'm very pleased that this change in focus has fueled strong e-commerce results, which are well ahead of the market across all three divisions.","We will continue to disproportionately invest in this growing channel, including further talent acquisition, data and product management systems, and in-house content creation capabilities, and expect e-commerce to make an increasing contribution to Coty's growth rate over time.","Finally, one of the most important areas for amplifying our growth potential is the work that we're doing to fuel momentum across all divisions in ALMEA. I already mentioned Brazil, so let me focus for a moment in China, which is a key area of opportunity for us. Our China presence is small today, but we have the right iconic brands for this market and our double-digit growth across all three divisions in fiscal 2018 reinforces our ability to win in China. ","Fiscal 2018 gave us clear confidence in ALMEA's role in our earnings model and we believe going forward ALMEA will be an increasing growth contributor. Within the contest of this framework, let me talk about how we're going to achieve our medium-term objective of stabilizing Consumer Beauty. We recognize that Western Europe and North America will continue to be under pressure due to the declines in traditional mass retail channels.","Our target is to neutralize these headwinds by improving our share performance in this region, and most importantly, by driving aggressive growth from new channels, new markets and down the road to new businesses. Over the next few years, we believe rapidly expanding markets in ALMEA like China, Brazil, Middle East and Mexico, as well as growing channels like e-commerce and Younique will provide increasing and disproportionate growth contributions.","Expanding on improving our share performance in North America and Western Europe, we will continue to build on the brand relaunches of COVERGIRL and Clairol. COVERGIRL accounts for a low teens percentage of total Consumer Beauty sales, and we've seen underlying improvement in the brands net revenue and consumption trends. Our focus is on driving consumption productivity on shelves with our retailer partners, and we're making good progress on improving productivity through better innovation and optimize assortment.","However, we see risk to our shelf space in fiscal 2019, tied to both supply chain disruptions, as well as our historical performance. To affect these challenges, we're continuing to prioritize three key areas. First, our innovation pipeline which focuses on core franchises. Second, our digital first mindset, which has brought COVERGIRL into the top 10 color cosmetic brands in the US, in terms of earned media value.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Speakers, you may resume.","Camillo Pane","Apologies for the technical inconvenience. I'll resume from where I believe that we had lost the connection. So, I was talking about COVERGIRL. To offset these challenges, we're continuing to prioritize three key areas: first, our innovation pipeline which focus on core franchises; second, our digital first mindset, which has brought COVERGIRL into the top ten color cosmetic brands in the U.S. in terms of earned media value; and third, introducing new ways for consumers to interact with the brand, such as our plan Time Square flagship store.","Another key European North American brand is Clairol. Although the relaunch of the Nice'N'Easy helped to moderate the decline in consumer sellout in the U.S., we're seeing stronger improvements in the UK and the recently increase in household penetration for the first time in several years, gives us confidence, the stronger innovation execution would allow us to improve the trend. In ALMEA, our focus is on accelerating growth through the brands that we know resonate extremely well with consumers, including Wella, Max Factor and Bourjois.","Our Wella brand, which is largest hair color brand in the Consumer Beauty division, and has the majority of these revenues coming from ALEMEA, gain share in several countries, including Mexico and Turkey. ","We believe that the potential of the overall retail hair color category in ALEMEA is substantial as consumers in many of this market's approach hair coloring as a social activity and we see significant opportunities for growth over the Wella brand in fiscal 2019 and beyond.","The joyful, Parisian positioning of Bourjois resonates well in regions such as the Middle East and we're in the very early days of introducing Bourjois in China, which allow us to push further into the masstige price segment.","On e-commerce, while still a small proportion of our Consumer Beauty business, it had delivered very good growth on the back of partnership in major retailers such as Amazon, Tmall and JD.com. While we still have a lot of work to do, we're actively adapting our product portfolio and processes to become a partner of choice in this rapidly growing channel.","Finally, Younique brings to Coty a differentiated and rapidly expanding business platform with a very attractive margin profile. In fiscal 2018, the business shows strong growth on a full-year basis. However, it's fair to say that Q4 2018 was a challenging one for Younique as we lapped one of Younique\u2019s biggest ever active presented quarters in Q4 2017.","We\u2019re now implementing announcement to the compensation program to further fuel presenter growth and loyalty, as well as strengthening our innovation pipeline. This coupled with new market expansion should enable sustainable strong net revenue growth and profit contribution as this platform is very well-positioned to capitalize on the trends of social selling with the partners of empowering women as entrepreneurs.","Now, let me turn back to the upcoming fiscal year. Given the supply chain constraint that I already mentioned, financial performance across quarters in fiscal 2019 will not be linear, with the peak of the impact of the supply chain constraints to come in Q1 2019 and a smaller tail in Q2 2019. This will have a significant impact on both top and bottom line, and together with the impact of our brand rationalization program is expected to drive the low teens decline in our Q1 adjusted operating income year-over-year. Our fiscal 2019 target takes the supply chain disruption into consideration.","I will now turn it over to Patrice, to speak about the fourth quarter and to elaborate on some of key financial priorities.","Patrice de Talhouet","Thank you, Camillo, and good morning everyone. I will start by providing a quick summary of our operating performance in Q4 2018 to round out the data Camillo has already provided for you. While we continue to strive for better topline results, we were pleased to end fiscal 2018 on a good note despite various internal and external headwinds. On the like-for-like basis, Q4 2018 revenues increased by 0.3%.","Camillo has already spoken about the supply chain disruption, but let me give a little more context to the scale of the supply chain changes we have implemented in the last 18 months. With the goal of simplifying our footprint and processes and delivering our committed synergies, we have shut down two factories, restructured a third factory, consolidated several supply chain planning locations into three planning hubs, consolidated six distribution centers and exited TSA agreements in over 30 countries. We have accomplished this unprecedented level of transformation in a record time and with virtually no disruption until the end of Q3 2018.","Nevertheless, during Q4 2018, the ramp up of one of our new planning hubs in the U.K. and the consolidation of one of our distribution centers in the U.S. was disrupted, impacting mostly the Consumer Beauty in Q4 2018 results, but also the Professional Beauty results in North America. We do expect that these business integration and related impacts will be largely over by the end of first half 2019 and our fiscal 2019 targets take the disruption into consideration.","Let me mention that, at the Coty, Inc. level, the Q4 2018 gross margin declined by 20 basis points, which was primarily driven by higher freight cost and the supply chain disruption. Without the supply chain issues, our gross margin would have slightly improved versus last year. Our A&CP investments, we made in the mid-20s percentage in the quarter, which is fairly consistent with the year-to-date trend.","The fourth quarter marked good progress in the reduction of our fixed costs base, although this is partially masked by FX translation impacts. In total, our Q4 adjusted operating income more than doubled year-over-year with 600 basis point of margin expansion to a margin of 10%. In total, we reported adjusted EPS of $0.14, bringing the EPS for the year to $0.69.","Let me now shift to the status of the integration. Last quarter, we told you about the program that represent an important final step in the Coty integration journey, the one order, one shipment, one invoice program. This will make Coty a fully integrated company, able to sell, ship, and invoice all of our brands in an integrated way for our customers. It will allow significant simplification in our go-to-market execution, increase our scalability potential, and with this final step, Coty will complete the most complex integration in the beauty industry.","In the context of our integration progress, we continue to expect cost synergies of $750 million and have achieved the first half of the synergies by fiscal 2018, including $225 million in fiscal 2018 alone. We expect to achieve a realization of the balance by the end of fiscal 2020.","Additionally, we achieved $470 million of our $500 million working capital benefit target through the end of fiscal 2018, largely driven by great progress with respect to tables. We continue to expect to incur one-off cost of approximately 1.3 billion, of which approximately 1.2 billion are expected to be cash.","As of fiscal 2018, we have accrued the $1.15 billion, with $860 million having been paid in cash, and the remaining $400 million still to come related to the P&G integration. One-time CapEx will remain in line with the original estimate of approximately $500 million, and as a fiscal 2018, we have incurred approximately $370 million of this $500 million.","I would now like to explain more about the new cost savings program that we're announcing today. This program, for which we will result a $250 million one-off charge over the next three years is being run independently from our P&G integration efforts and the previously communicated P&G integration cost program. And is meant to drive simplicity and generate flexibility in our P&L, to be able to fuel strategic investment such as those in the digital and e-commerce areas.","We expect to deliver up to $150 million of gross savings over the next three years as a result of this program with a significant portion reinvested in our digital transformation agenda. As a result of these investments, we would expect incremental net savings to be approximately $60 million over the next three years.","In Q4 2018, we had cash outflows of approximately $16 million in connection with this program and would expect the remaining cost to impact fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 cash flows. Against this backdrop, let me provide some color on our cash flow. In fiscal 2018, operating cash flow totaled $414 million, down from $758 million in fiscal 2017, which benefited from over $400 million related to the timing lag between one-time cost accruals and the associated cash outlay.","While best-in-class working capital remains a key objective, we were disappointed to see working capital of deterioration of approximately $100 million, driven by receivables and inventory, even as we have made strong progress on payables. Free cash flow ended the year at negative $33 million.","Now that the integration of the ex-P&G business is progressing towards its completion, we will be increasing our focus on cash generation and their regime. To that end, we have set a target of achieving a net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of below 4 by the end of calendar year 2020. The target takes into account, any minor M&A activity we might consider.","Talking about M&A, let me take a moment to address our brand divestiture as mentioned on the last earnings call. Since announcing the P&G Beauty transaction, we have rationalized the total of 14 brands from the combined portfolio. This includes the sale of Playboy and Cerruti in recent months for total proceeds of $33 million. The sale of Cutex and JLo in the last two years for $40 million and the termination or expiration of 10 other brands, including CLC [ph], Celine Dion, Chopard, Esprit, GUESS, Halle Berry, Lady Gaga, Love 2 Love, Summer [ph] and Tim McGraw.","As I have previously mentioned, these disposals allow us to simplify the business and we expect these portfolio rationalization to have a mid-single digit annual impact on EPS, which is already reflected in our fiscal 2019 EPS target.","On the other hand, at the start of Q1 2019, we took the opportunity for the Luxury division to purchase the license right to our Escada fragrance brand for a total consideration of EUR35 million. This was a good business opportunity that allows us to develop the Escada brand through unconstrained innovation, creating support and additional distribution.","Let me now walk you through the most important drivers of our deleveraging plan. In fiscal 2019, deleveraging will principally occur through a combination of organic profit growth, as well as improvement of our networking capital. In 2020, we expect deleveraging to benefit from a significant decline in the cash impact from our one-off cost program.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we have approximately 3 billion of liquidity to cover all debt maturities in the short and medium-term. I'm pleased to report that in the beginning of August, we took advantage of good market condition to further solidify our balance sheet by extending the maturity of our interest rate swap portfolio such that we maintain a comfortable 50-50 ratio or fixed to floating debt over the next three years.","Looking forward, we would expect that ratio to improve as we reduce the notional value of our floating rate debt.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Speakers you may resume.","Patrice de Talhouet","Hey guys, sorry for the interruption. So, I was about to finish by saying, finally, I would like to share some thoughts regarding this morning's announcement that I assume you all have seen. After having been with Coty for five years, I feel incredibly proud of what has been achieved and the progress against our transformation agenda.","My time here has been a very intense and fulfilling professional journey. My commitment has been such that I have neglected critical topics in my personal life. Therefore, knowing that we are getting close to the completion of fully integrating the ex-P&G business, I now feel comfortable making the decision to resign from Coty.","I'm and will remain a very strong advocate of the Coty story. I'm confident that the strategy and team in place, we will ultimately lead the company to fulfil its mission. As a consequence, I will hold onto my Coty shares, will remain CFO until mid-September and will assist Camillo with an orderly transition thereafter.","Camillo Pane","Thank you, Patrice. As you all know, Patrice has been a tremendous contributor to Coty for nearly five years and a valuable partner to me for almost two years. He managed our finances during Coty's transformation from a newly public emerging contender in beauty to our current status as a nearly 10 billion global beauty powerhouse, including several complex M&A transactions.","With the integration that P&G Beauty acquisition largely complete, we now have the foundation to allow us to focus on the next stage of our journey. I thank Patrice for his valid service and personal commitment. As Group CFO, Patrice has been an important member of our leadership team and has been instrumental in helping Coty undertake the most ambitious integration in the beauty industry. I wish him well in his next chapter.","With Patrice's announcement today, we now plan to begin a full search for our next CFO. We will look to appoint a successor, as soon as reasonably possible and to ensure a smooth transition.","I'm pleased to announce Ayesha Zafar, Coty's Senior Vice President, Group Controller, will serve as the Interim Chief Financial Officer, effective September 15, 2018. Ayesha has been responsible accounting operations and financial reporting, including as Coty's Principal Accounting Officer for more than two years as she brings 30 years of financial experience across several multinational consumer goods and pharmaceutical companies, including The Hertz Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Campbell Soup Company, PepsiCo, and Colgate-Palmolive Company. I thank Ayesha in advance for stepping into this role.","Now back to Candice for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thank you, good morning. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about Brazil, because the commentary around in-market performance is really interesting and particularly contrasting the reported results. So, could you talk a little bit about the outlook for 2019. So \u2013 are the inventory drawdowns that needed to take place, is that done? Pricing in the right place and so on? Is 2019 a year where we will start to see what you're saying is very good in-market retail, in-market share performance have to come through overall? Thanks.","Camillo Pane","Thanks, Lauren. I'll be happy to expand on Brazil. As I mentioned also in the last call, we clearly had a price increase, which led to the stocking and to clearly protract the negotiation with our customers. I'm pleased to say that the negotiation with the customers are largely complete, so the price increase has been now accepted and we continue to see share gains in the market on most of our brands, actually all of our brands. If I look at the overall Coty performance in Brazil, we are growing more than double than the market and among the multinationals, we are the fastest growing multinational company there in Brazil for the last couple of quarters, for the first \u2013 sort of second half of fiscal 2018. This is also resulting, so the strength of our brand in terms of consumer pool and sellout is also resulting in some space gain, because clearly, we are also talking to our customers about readjusting our shelf space, now that we continue to see \u2013 we continue to see protracted gains in consumer sellout across a couple of groups.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you very much. On July 3rd, there was an announcement of a fairly or at least seem to be a fairly significant reorganization of the consumer group, including changes in the leadership, talking about more focus on the key brands. I'm wondering if you could go into that in a little bit more detail, kind of explain, kind of, you know the thought behind those changes. And then also address the \u2013 what shelf space looks like going forward for consumer in the U.S. based on what you're seeing today? Thank you.","Camillo Pane","Thank you for the question Robert. So, we have announced a reorganization of the market structure within the Consumer Beauty division. So, now we have three CMOs, which have come on board or have been with the company already for a while, but have been brought up to report directly to Laurent, the President of Consumer Beauty. The intention is clearly to have a much stronger agility, so faster decision making and having the proximity of the three CMOs straight to the President. There is also higher consumers centricity, because the CMOs have split the portfolio in three more or less equal area from color cosmetic to hair color and body care and so on.","And then another change that we've made is that we have raised the position of the digital lead for the Consumer Beauty division, so that also this person will report directly to Laurent, given the importance of this rapidly growing channel and part of the business. So, all these changes have been done, clearly bringing onboard people with a great track record and with the objective of becoming more agile and continue to really making progress in this division.","Your second question was about I think shelf space. I mentioned in my remarks that we do see some headwinds in the shelf space in North America. This is driven by the supply chain constraints that we're having in the last couple of months, because as you could imagine, this has made the conversation with the retailers a bit more complex. And also, if you can imagine, it's all a matter of looking at the productivity of the shelves.","Now, what I said in my remarks, which is very positive is the fact that we are seeing productivity improvement in COVERGIRL and we will continue of course to work on this key measure of productivity. And as matter of fact, what we've done in the U.S., we also changed the incentive system for the salesforce by moving from gross sales, which really means volume to net revenues, which is clearly a KPI that is much more focused on productivity and much more in line with the KPIs that our retailer partners have.","Robert Ottenstein","And just in terms of the shelf space, based on your conversations with the retailers, is the issue purely one-off supply or are there other concerns?","Camillo Pane","I think it's a mix. I think the suppliers clearly brought on the table a different type of conversation in the last couple of months, but I also want to repeat what Patrice said, which is that we strongly believe that the supply issues will be over, you know the majority at the end of Q1 and definitely at the end of first half of 2019. So, clearly there is a temporary issue which unfortunately we had due to the consolidation of the planning center, the warehouses that Patrice mentioned.","The point that I had made about productivity is more a productive point because clearly comes from many years \u2013 many years of the brands that indeed having the right level of investment. Now the situation is different. We are investing with the brand. We're having much stronger pipeline. We are seeing improvements in consumer sellout, as Patrice mentioned that we have improvement on both brands in net revenues and the sellout and we plan to continue to invest behind the brands to continue the strengths towards the stabilization.","Nevertheless, the decisions are made and we continue to work with the retailers to accept this one. But we're very confident also about the innovation pipeline that we're bringing in 2019, the second half of 2019 on both brands, and this is one of our objectives to offset the headwinds.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Faiza Alwy","Hi, thanks, good morning. So, I wanted to pick-up Camillo on the investment in brands. So, it looks like the A&P spending in the year and in the quarter was below last year and below what you talked about historically, sort of around the 25% to 26% of sales. So, could you give us some color on the year-over-year decline in the quarter specifically. And also, as we think about your outlook for next year, so what are you embedding for marketing spending for fiscal 2019?","Camillo Pane","Thanks, Faiza. Look, in terms of the decline for 2018, it's fair to say that some of the new business that we've been now consolidated in for 2018, such as ghd naturally have a lower level of A&CP spend, which clearly reduces the ratio on a year-to-year basis. We're also \u2013 because we're doing all the brand relaunches, on COVERGIRL and Clairol, as you can imagine, we have to allocate more resources into in-store investments, and of course this type of investments don't flow into the A&CP line.","And the third point, I think it's our continuous effort to invest more on digital media, which is typically more cost effective than traditional media. We do have now over 30% of our media spending there is focused on digital and in some brands we're actually over 50%. So, these three trends clearly, I think explain, I would say fully, the decline that you've seen in the ratio in 2018.","Now, looking at the future, I think, based on these strategic plans that we have across brands and division, we would expect A&CP to generally remain in the mid-20s percentage, but I will not get really to, let's say, obsessed about this percentage, because there is always a room for increases or decreases, because we will continue to move money towards the digital media, and at the same time, we will consider higher investment to support. So, this sort of dynamic is something that we will manage on a quarterly and annual basis as we see fit.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Joe Lachky","HI, thanks. I was hoping you could walk through the drivers of free cash flow in fiscal 2018 and why it came in so far below your expectations. And I guess, maybe there was an issue with receivables and inventories, hoping you could expand on that. And then looking forward on free cash flow, you specifically mentioned the timing of cash synergy costs and \u2013 so you're expecting ongoing pressure on free cash flow in the fiscal 2019 and what level of free cash do you expect in relation to your original guidance of roughly $900 million to $1 billion in fiscal 2019? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhouet","Thanks for the question. So, on the free cash flow in fiscal 2018, what you should really be remind is that, first, we have made very good progress in terms of payables, because now we had achieved some synergies of $470 million versus the $500 million target. So, on this one, we have exceeded our expectation. It's true that we were disappointed by a couple of areas, mainly on inventories, little bit related to our supply chain disruption.","Now, what other also impacted quite a bit in fiscal 2018 is the cash effect of the one-off that we have accrued last year, and there is a lag time between the accrual and the cash that has impacted 2018 and that will also impact 2019. And as a result of that, you should factor that into the equation into the [indiscernible] we will generate in 2019 and 2020. This being said, for the first time, we've cleared out a target of what we would like to achieve in the leverage to be a ratio of net debt-to-EBITDA to be below 4 [ph] by the end of the calendar 2020.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steph Wissink of Jefferies. Your line is now open. ","Steph Wissink","Hi, good morning everyone. We have a question just on the competitive dynamics. I think you among your peers have talked about intensifying competition and then maybe that forces you to lean a little bit more aggressively into your brand investment. Could you just give us a scope of kind of worldwide what you're seeing in terms of overall competition across channels and then across two different segments? Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Speakers, you are now reconnected.","Steph Wissink","Camillo and Patrice, you have got stuck [indiscernible] I'm not sure if my line is still open, but our question was related to the competitive dynamics. I think you among your peers have cited competition across markets of the world. And I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in-market across particularly your Consumer and your Luxury segments with respect to the competitive dynamics? Thank you.","Camillo Pane","So, if I look \u2013 if is I start with Luxury Steph, I think the competition \u2013 the competitive intensity has not changed massively, it's very intense without any doubt. But I'm very pleased to say that we have been growing share across most countries around the world. The performance in Luxury is absolutely excellent and we're driving share not only with the new innovation, which I mentioned in my remarks, but also by growing share on our classic, on our classic pillars as we say in fragrances and this is really pleasing. On top of it, we have very high strong growth in China, in travel retail and clearly the rollout of philosophy in Asia and especially in China is also driving our performance.","When I look at Professional Beauty, of course remains clearly competitive and very intense. Here, what I would say is that we have a couple of dynamics which I believe are important for us. One is the uncapped potential of OPI and ghd. These are very complementary product to our go-to-market capabilities, which are very strong in the B2B in the service area. ","And I think when you look at e-commerce, what is important is that we are also building our own B2B platform with the MyWellaStore, which would allow really to take orders directly online from our very fragmented customer base, and we should not forget also the ghd, we have our own B2C platform both ghd and OPI and they are growing very, very fast.","Going on Consumer Beauty, which is also part of your question. This is where we have seen an increase in competitive activity, which is clearly something that we are working through. We have increased our investments with \u2013 on COVERGIRL and Clairol. This is something very different from the past where these two brands didn't really receive enough attention. ","The innovation pipeline is also stronger, and we are confident because we do have a strong innovation pipeline coming in 2019 and we're also very much encouraged by the promising results that we see on digital where COVERGIRL enter the top 10 in the color cosmetic brands for EMV and also, we saw other reports from word of mouth where COVERGIRL clearly is starting to get attraction in the conversation with consumers and beauty experts.","So, overall, we see intense and competitive, but we do have a lot of tools and we should not forget that within Consumer Beauty, we also want to neutralize these headwinds, by also making disproportionate growth and investments in ALMEA, e-commerce and Younique. These are three areas or three platforms where we have high level of confidence for the future for the reason that I explained before in my remarks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira, JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Christina Brathwaite","Good morning It's Christina Brathwaite on for Andrea. I guess, first if I go back to the plan on shelf space, I just want to put a finer point on the question. Are you embedding that shelf space continues to contract in the back half of the year in that flat to up modest like-for-like sales growth guidance? And then second question, can you just talk about your commitment to dividend payment, just given kind of the contraction that you've seen in free cash flow and continuing to decline. Does that really make sense for this level of dividend going forward, do you think it is sustainable for your business?","Camillo Pane","I'll answer the first question, Christina, and then Patrice will answer the one on the dividends. Yes, the risk that we see on shelf space in U.S. is included in our targets for 2019. So that's the simple answer to that.","Patrice de Talhouet","Yes. And the second one will be as sweet and short, the dividends, we are going to maintain the dividends going forward. We don't have any plan to decrease it or to increase it, but we will keep it flat, probably in the foreseeable future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open. ","Mark Astrachan","Thanks. Hello everyone. So, I wanted to follow-up first on the free cash flow question. So, I guess, how should we think about free cash flow generation given obviously what happened in fiscal 2018 and I think roughly $340 million delta between accrued and paid costs through year-end fiscal 2018. So, should we expect another year of free cash flow approaching zero in fiscal 2019, should it improve even if not back to fiscal 2017 level. So, any sort of commentary you can give there? And then, just a broader question on EBIT margin target. So, you reiterated the high teens expectations, I guess, I don't get it. I mean, spend is going up for just about every one of your competitors out there. I think it's fair to say that certainly from a stock standpoint, most don't believe you can achieve it. So, why stick with it at this point, what gives you confidence you can do that without harming the brands of the business, particularly on the consumer side, it tends to be more actionable as it relates to the advertising and marketing spend. So, just sort of any commentary there would be helpful.","Camillo Pane","Sure, Mark. So, I will start with the free cash flow. So, on fiscal 2019, what you should expect is that, first, we are going to work on the two levers of the working capital that we did not explore to the full extent so far, which are the receivables and inventory. Second, we are going to start to tighten the CapEx because for the time being, we have spent quite a bit amount of CapEx to integrate the two businesses together. So that should come back up to a more normal level in 2019 and even more so in 2020.","And third, even more precisely on the one-off, what you should estimate is that we expect to have roughly a $400 million of cash for more in our restructuring program that will still impact fiscal 2019. And what you should see in 2020 is that as a result of that, you would have the full operating leverage with the working capital improvement, a significant impact to positively the free cash flow. So, I would say 2020 we will be back to normal and 2019 will still be negatively impacted by the $400 million cash outflow due to the restructuring program.","Patrice de Talhouet","So, the second part Mark of the question is clearly on the high teens, medium term target over the next five years. So, the focus is now clearly for us in enhancing the operating profit. So, we've got to deliver the cost synergies and return the business to the low-single digits, like-for-like net revenue growth. So, if you take this top line \u2013 this level of top line growth, and you combine it with the synergies, the new cost saving program and the ongoing focus on reducing cost, which will continue even after the synergies are delivered, I believe that we can \u2013 this basically underpins our medium-term target of achieving the high teens adjusted margin.","And when you look at the earnings model underneath, clearly, the first thing that we really look at is to sustain an above-market top line expansion on Luxury. We believe we can do that. We have a fantastic team with a great track record in the industry, but also track record within Coty. If you think of the, sort of growth and in-market results that we've achieved in the Luxury division over the last 1.5 year, plus we do have a strong pipeline, a lot of still room in geographic expansion and we have the Prestige skin color and the Prestige color cosmetic that we still have to develop and we are only at the beginning.","When I look in Luxury clearly, you can see has \u2013 is a high level of profitability, which will continue to really grow. Professional Beauty is also something that we aim to accelerate. I mentioned OPI and ghd, and clearly the strength on Wella color, but also there will be operating leverage because we will continue to invest more on digital educational tools and digital sales tool rather than \u2013 on our current high fixed cost base.","And then looking at Consumer Beauty, this is what I said before, our goal is, we recognize that Western Europe and North America will continue to be under pressure and we will work hard to neutralize these headwinds, and of course, trying to grow our share in these two regions, but we're very confident in the future in the new markets, in ALMEA, in e-commerce and Younique. And Younique has a much higher marginality or margin ratio versus everything else in Consumer Beauty. e-commerce is also proving to us to be a profitable channel and over time, once we build better supply capabilities for e-commerce, this will become even more profitable.","In ALMEA, I think at the beginning of course we were investing capabilities, but over time, we believe that the margin will start going up because we will cycle through all the investment capabilities and we will have operating leverage there as well. So, I think by explaining to you a bit of the earnings model again, hopefully I've answered your question of why we believe that over the next five years, we can achieve the high teens pretty much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning and thank you very much. I want to ask a bigger picture question Camillo, and when we go back to the PG integration, I'm trying to understand what's \u2013 how much of the \u2013 what's been lost as far as is this taking longer than we hoped, is permanent versus just changes in the marketplace, decline in the opportunity available to mass beauty companies, and how much of this is just deferred. And specifically, I mean, it seems like you have hit a lot of your integration targets, but just been negatively surprised by the evolution of the business. So, if you could just comment about when you think about the kind of targets you were thinking about two or three years ago, do we ever get to those at this point and if so, when? Thank you.","Camillo Pane","So, I think the first thing that I need to say is that a couple of quarters ago, I have already mentioned that the medium-term targets of high teens operating margin, and I did say that the original targets, which were discussed before the closing of the P&G transactions are not relevant anymore. They're not relevant anymore for a couple of reasons. One is, because we have inherited the smaller business, and the second one, because we have faced headwinds and challenges.","And the third one is because the organization was designed for a larger business, and clearly with a higher fixed cost base. Hence the restructuring \u2013 the cost saving program that I'm announcing today with the $250 million of one-off charges. So, I think this answers a bit of question on what is our medium-term outlook versus the original numbers that were discussed before the transactions.","In terms of your first question, which is, are these headwinds permanent or have we lost the piece of business or we wanted to recover, and a lot of this \u2013 the business has contracted. First, we inherited the smaller business, because when we took it was smaller, because it took so long. You might remember, it was 16 months between the day we announced in July 15, and the day we took over the business in October 16, and so the business became smaller during that time.","And then second, I think that the loss \u2013 the decline that we have in Consumer Beauty over the last 18 months, it's something that we have to deal with because the market condition have changed. This is an industry that is rapidly changing. So, our focus has to be on the future, has to be on continuing to improve our share and in productivity, as I mentioned, launching better products to really delight our consumers and invest behind our brands. But at the same time, we've got to make smart choices right. So ALMEA, Younique, e-commerce, these are the areas with high marginality that we need to invest, because there is a lot of growth opportunities there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Olivia Tong of Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Olivia Tong","Great, thank you. Just on the COVERGIRL, a quick one, the supply chain disruptions you talked about, is that on the new stuff or clearing out old inventory, and at this point are you done getting the old inventory out on COVERGIRL. And then my bigger question is just around your view on low single-digit like-for-like growth and better understanding of your expectations and contribution by divisions, because I'm assuming that you think that Luxury and Professional continue to grow at a similar run rate in fiscal 2018. But I also -- I'm kind of a little confused in terms of your views on Consumer Beauty. Is your expectation that it continues to decline, but decline at a lesser pace or that it actually stabilizes to flat. Just given all the volatility in your growth in recent quarters, it would be helpful to just understand the view on the growth potential by category. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Speakers you're now reconnected.","Camillo Pane","Olivia this is Camillo. Sorry, again. I got all your questions. So, I'll reply to all your questions \u2013 you didn't cut off before. So, I got it. So, the first one is on COVERGIRL inventory. So, first of all, let me clarify something. The supply chain disruptions happened because as part of the transition, we're consolidating the full \u2013 we're optimizing the full supply and logistic footprint and one of the things we're doing, we're consolidating planning centers. ","So, one of the planning centers that mainly do color cosmetics in the U.K. got distracted, which means the capacity was affected, then this is why we had this disruption, which as I said, will continue with heavier impact in Q1 2019. COVERGIRL was not impacted a lot by this. This was mostly on Rimmel and Max Factor and in other smaller brands. So, I just want to reassure you that the supplying disruption doesn't relate to COVERGIRL.","And to answer your second question, the inventory sell-through of the old stock, so the sell-through of the old stock of inventory of COVERGIRL is almost finished, it's going through, you know we are towards the end, because now all the new packaging \u2013 I would say, by December, end of calendar 2018, we should have all the new packaging for all SKUs on shelf.","Now, your other question is how \u2013 we have mentioned a target for 2019 of low single digits like-for-like in net revenue growth. So, let me tell you how this is composed a bit. So, as you rightly so said, we expect strong growth from Luxury and Professional Beauty. I did mention before, why we are confident about this division continue to deliver above market performance and therefore gaining share.","And regarding Consumer Beauty, our goal is to mark and have progress towards stabilization. So, yes, better performance at the minus 4% that we had in 2018, but not necessarily enough to stabilize the business already 2018. But the dynamic within this progress of this Consumer Beauty target is truly by also neutralizing the headwinds in North America and Europe by over proportionately investing in ALMEA, Younique and e-commerce.","The results that we saw in ALMEA, because if you exclude Brazil, ALMEA grew double-digits in Consumer Beauty and the results that we have in Younique and clearly the results in e-commerce that I mentioned today really give us confidence that these earnings model can work in bringing Consumer Beauty to make progress towards stabilization.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Linda Bolton Weiser of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Linda Bolton Weiser","Thanks, Hi. So, when you originally bought your Brazilian business, my understanding was that it would help you to penetrate into Brazil with some of your other mass market brands. Is that still the plan long-term and has any progress been made at all in trying to use their positioning in Brazil to expand some of your other brands into that market? Thanks.","Camillo Pane","Thanks for the question Linda. Absolutely, I think Brazil remains one of our powerhouse within Consumer Beauty, and I mentioned before, to one of the earlier question from Lauren about the continuing market success, which gives us confidence for 2019 and beyond about Coty Brazil in Consumer Beauty.","Looking at our portfolio, I think it's important, you know 80% of our portfolio there is made by local brands and these brands are really brands which are loved by consumers and the good news is that there are always marked buys, because the acquisition is lower than the international brands, but there are also \u2013 we are now also investing in innovation and packaging in consumer connection by doing advertising.","So, we are actually treating and supporting our brands in a different way on how it was done \u2013 it was done before. Now, our plan to increase price would also help us to improve profitability in Brazil, which will allow us to continue with our plans.","Looking at the international brands, the two main brands really that we have there, one is Wella in hair retail, which clearly, we acquired from P&G, it's the number 2 brand there in hair color and in retail. And the second one is Adidas, and Adidas is actually is a brand that we've been developing for the last year, which was not [indiscernible] in Brazil before clearly the acquisition of the other markets company. And that is one of the answer to your question about how we're using some of our global brands in Brazil, using the footprint there. And of course, we will consider more in the future.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Pane, for any closing remarks.","Camillo Pane","So, I would like to make a couple of closing remarks. So, first, I would like to thank Patrice one more time and wish him well in his next chapter. Second, I would like to reemphasize the importance of the earnings model that I've gone through today, which will underpin our medium-term target. We look for Luxury to sustain its above market top line expansion. Professional Beauty to accelerate growth by maximizing the untapped potential of OPI and ghd. And in Consumer Beauty to stabilize the division top line and improve the bottom line.","We recognize that Western Europe and North America will continue to be under pressure, due to declines in traditional mass retail channels, but our target is to neutralize these headwinds by improving our share performance in these regions and most importantly by driving aggressive growth rapidly in expanding markets, as well as grow in channels like e-commerce and Younique. We are incredibly energized and excited about the year ahead and I look forward to talking to you again in November. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Wednesday, May 10. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, please go ahead.","Kevin Monaco - Coty, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Camillo Pane, Chief Executive Officer; and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where we list factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release. I would also like to point out that we have included in the appendix of the earnings release, a quarterly reconciliation of reported net revenues to like-for-like net revenues by segment on a combined company basis.","I will now turn the call over to Camillo.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody, to Coty's third quarter conference call. Since we last spoke in February, progress continues to be made, both from delivering an improvement in top line and bottom line trends, as compared to the first half, and on stable execution on my strategic vision for the company. However, it's very clear that fiscal 2017 remains a transitional year and there is still a lot of work that needs to be done to fully address the challenges we are facing in some of our categories and brands.","So, let me start with the recent performance of the business. Our Q3 underlying net revenue trends, excluding the contribution from ghd and Younique, improved sequentially to minus 2% at constant currency compared to a high single digit decline in the first half. This improvement was driven by good growth in the Luxury division, flat performance in Professional Beauty, and improvement but continued negative performance in the Consumer Beauty division.","Including ghd, Younique and one month of the Brazil acquisition, our net revenue grew 6% at constant currency versus the combined net revenues of the prior year period. From a profit point of view, our adjusted operating income more than doubled in Q3 versus the prior year period, which is a very solid performance that underlines the margin strength of our business. Patrice will talk more about our overall financial performance.","Focusing on the revenue trends, the momentum in the Luxury division, which grew 2% in the quarter, reflected the first impact of some of our initiatives that will bring us to a more sustainable performance in the future, aided by the launches of Hugo Iced and Boss Tonic, Chlo\u00e9 Love Story Eau Sensuelle and Miu Miu L'Eau Bleue, several of our brands saw solid growth in the quarter. In addition, Gucci Guilty Absolute, which launched at the end of March is off to a strong start.","Geographically, in North America, we're still facing some challenges, and we have recently transformed our field sales, education and trade marketing functions to a more customer-centric approach. We're already seeing positive initial results from these changes, although it's still early in the process.","In the rest of the world, we saw strong performance in Europe, ALMEA and travel retail. And this marks the third quarter in a row of Coty travel retail revenue growth outpacing the market.","In Professional, we have maintained the momentum in the salon hair portfolio, which grew low-single digits with consistent growth across all three regions.","Wella continued strong traction in its contouring collection, which uses color placement technique and product to alter the appearance of any face shape. We also saw continued success in the rollout of System Professional and with a market performance of the Nioxin brand. On the other hand, OPI remained under pressure with encouraging growth in gels and long-wear, more than offset by declines in lacquers. This is an area, where we'll need to deliver better performance in the near future, taking advantage of the deep capabilities we now have in business-to-business and the professional channel.","In Consumer Beauty, which declined 6% organically for the combined business, we've continued to see underlying challenges, especially in North America, driven by a combination of weak market trends across several of our categories and some reduction of shelf space for a few brands. The shelf space losses are primarily the results of decision taken prior to Coty taking ownership of the former P&G Beauty Business. We're currently working with our key retailers, presenting to them our new brand pipelines and programs in order to reinforce their confidence in the future prospect of these brands.","However, in the quarter, the Consumer Beauty division benefited from the strong performance of our Brazil business, which not only delivered double-digit sell-through growth and share gains in most brands, but also benefited from a lower (6:10) revenue comparison in the prior-year period. In addition to the strength in Brazil, we have seen a number of highlights in the Consumer Beauty portfolio, including share growth in the retail hair business in some emerging markets.","Consistent with our expectations, the fiscal 2017 will be a transitional year. The path to recovery will take some time and will not be a straight line. For example, we expect the constant currency net revenue trends in Q4, excluding Younique and ghd, to weaken sequentially versus Q3. Altogether, I'm pleased that we are delivering on our promise to gradually improve the sales performance of the business even if the strategic efforts we're putting in place will take time to deliver results.","So let me take a moment to recap the strategy I outlined last quarter. Our first focus is to continue to strengthen and nurture our iconic global brands, including COVERGIRL, Rimmel and Clairol in Consumer Beauty; Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss and Gucci in Luxury; and Wella and OPI in Professional Beauty.","Our second focus is to cultivating few of the smaller brands with higher growth potential in our portfolio. Our third focus is to stabilize the remaining brands, whether through active portfolio rationalization or other measures. Our fourth focus is on, continue to expand the geographical reach of our strong portfolio, as many of our brands still have substantial opportunity for geographical expansion, leveraging our global distribution footprint. Finally, we're also completing the shaping of our new organization, including making sure we have the right talent in key roles to drive growth in our brands.","On this front, I'm very pleased that Laurent Kleitman will be joining Coty next week as President of Consumer Beauty. I believe Laurent is exceptionally qualified to take leadership of the Consumer Beauty division, given his extensive experience in the beauty industry, his strong operational background in both developed and emerging markets as well as track record with full P&L ownership.","And as we outlined last quarter, we aim to achieve our strategic objectives through four key pillars. First, we are repositioning some of the brands, including COVERGIRL, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, in order to reconnect these brands with the consumers, building on their existing strong brand equity. We are really making great progress and we have announced new creative agency for all the three brands, including Droga5 for COVERGIRL, adam&eveDDB for Max Factor and Anomaly for Sally Hansen.","While the latest agencies had supported the cosmetic brands for several decades, this transition to some of the world's leading and digitally forward creative agency will bring new perspective and creativity to the brands. We've begun to share the detailed brand relaunch plans with our key customers and the retailer feedback has been very positive.","Speaking about the COVERGIRL relaunch, we plan to start introducing the new brand visual this coming winter. And I want to emphasize that a one-year brand relaunch timeline for a category as complex as color cosmetic, with COVERGIRL alone distributing over 60,000 doors, speaks to the improved organizational structure and ownership mentality of the new Coty organization. It would likely not have been possible at either Legacy-Coty or P&G Beauty.","Second, we're making significant changes to our innovation and product development process in parts of the organization, focus on spotting the trends early and slashing our average time-to-market, which is currently about 12 to 18 months.","On this front, we're actively setting up the necessary capabilities and structure throughout the organization. Our agency, Beamly, is already actively utilizing its digital social listening and trend spotting capabilities to fuel ideas to the marketing and product development teams.","Third, we are accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation into the e-commerce. As a key step to our commitment to strengthen our e-commerce capabilities across the company, we recently appointed the Head of Global E-Commerce, a newly created position for Coty with a new organizational structure behind him.","At the same time, we are continuing our digital transformation efforts across our divisions and regions. From a regional perspective, I would like to highlight China as a strong example of Coty growing traction in e-commerce. E-commerce accounted for over 20% of Consumer Beauty revenues in China, driven by brands like Max Factor, Bourjois, and adidas.","In our direct-to-consumer efforts, COVERGIRL is seeing early success in tapping into consumers' desire for personalization and customization with the launch of the Custom Blend app. The app launch relies entirely on a digital, social and influencer-led go-to-market approach with COVERGIRL shipping customized foundations since November launch.","Finally, I would like to highlight two recent launches in the Luxury division, which has simplified our digital-first mentality. The recent launch of Marc Jacobs Daisy pillar was supported by an holistic digital campaign, including influencer events, organic social coverage, activation across retailers' dotcom sites and the announcement of Kaia Gerber as the face of the brand, securing 600 million global media impressions. This has translated to exceptionally early sell-through results for both Daisy and the Marc Jacobs brand across our key U.S. retailer partners.","And as announced last week, we've just begun the launch of Gucci Bloom, the first scent to be conceptualized by Gucci Creative Director, Alessandro Michele, with an inclusive and customer-centric communication strategy focused on millennials. I'm very excited about the prospect of this launch and the digital-first mentality that I now see becoming ingrained throughout the organization.","And fourth, we are working to significantly ramp our in-store execution. Several of our color cosmetic brands, including Bourjois and Rimmel, are already in the process of deploying a new brand vision across stores. Additionally, we're beginning to transition some legacy distributor businesses to our local affiliates, which I expect to steadily bring benefits to our execution and financials.","Finally, our M&A strategy, which Patrice will discuss in more detail, is delivering on the strategic objectives we have outlined for each of our divisions. I'm very satisfied with the revenue performance of our recent acquisitions, ghd and Younique, which are growth accretive to our business, and I believe in their strong future potential.","Additionally, since we last spoke in February, I'm proud to say we announced the agreement to acquire the Burberry Beauty business. Burberry is an iconic and beauty through (13:07) luxury brand with global relevance and fits excellently into our strategy to continue to expand our premium offering in the prestige fragrance and cosmetic categories within our Luxury portfolio. As a global fragrance leader, we believe we are the ideal partner for Burberry, and I'm looking forward to having this great brand with us.","In summary, we are making solid progress. Fiscal 2017 remains a challenging transitional year, but one that we believe is setting the stage for enormous potential as a global leader and challenger in beauty.","I will now turn it over to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Camillo, and good morning, everyone. It has now been over six months since we closed on the P&G transaction and reorganized into a new focused divisional organization that combines the expertise and talents of executives from Coty, P&G Beauty Business and other leading companies. While the Reverse Morris Trust carve-out merger with the P&G Beauty Business remains incredibly complex, I am very pleased with the progress we have made to-date on the creation of a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry.","Let me begin with an update on the progress we have made integrating the two businesses. On May 1, we successfully completed the first stage of our three-stage exit from the Transitional Services Agreement or TSA with P&G. Stage one was the exit for all of North America. This means that we have transferred and have now fully integrated the legacy P&G Beauty Business into Coty's system and processes for all business operation in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica.","To give you an appreciation of the scale and magnitude of the cut-over from P&G to Coty, all production, orders, shipping and billing were housed in the North American P&G Beauty Business, across two flagship factories and seven distribution centers, including third-party manufacturing locations, while data, systems and infrastructure were cut over.","We then began a controlled start-up in the Coty system across the region for production, orders, shipments, billing and finance transaction in the newly integrated sites. This is a tremendous achievement, with North America accounting for close to a third of the combined company revenues. I want to thank all of the teams involved for all of their incredibly hard work in preparing for this transition and the work that's still underway to prepare for the stage two exit, TSA in Europe, which is expected in the course of July, followed by ALMEA in September.","Now, let me provide some of the highlights for the third quarter. Q3 net revenues of $2 billion increased 115% as reported compared to Legacy-Coty and increased 6% at constant currency compared to combined Coty and P&G Beauty Business net revenues in the prior period. Excluding the contribution from ghd and Younique, our combined company organic net revenues declined 2%.","As anticipated, we received a modest 1% boost in Q3 as a result of pre-shipments to customer ahead of the TSA cut-over. At this point, we would anticipate that in Q4, the incremental negative from these North American TSA-related pull-forwards into Q3 will be generally offset by Europe TSA-related pull-forwards into Q4, resulting in a neutral overall impact.","By division, Luxury net revenues reported growth of 2% at constant currency compared to combined company revenues in the prior year. Professional Beauty net revenues grew 40% at constant currency compared to the combined company revenues in the prior year or flat performance, excluding the contribution from ghd. While professional hair grew in the low single-digits and ghd also saw mid single-digit revenue growth versus prior year, OPI remained under pressure.","Consumer Beauty net revenues grew 5% at constant currency compared to combined company revenues in the prior year, and declined 6% constant currency, excluding the contribution from Younique. Substantial sequential improvement in the Consumer Beauty organic sales trends relative to the approximately 10% decline reported last quarter, excluding the transitional impact, reflected the benefits of the strong performance of our Brazil business.","As Camillo discussed, our Consumer Beauty business in Brazil not only delivered double-digit sell-through growth, but also benefit from a low revenue net comparison in the prior year period as a result of trade terms harmonization following the closing of the Hypermarcas transaction.","Let's now go into the shape of the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin of 63.3% increased from 61.8% for Legacy-Coty in the prior year period, aided by the addition of the higher gross margin P&G Beauty and Younique businesses. The Q3 adjusted operating income more than doubled to $219 million on a constant currency basis and $208 million at actual rates from $103 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior year period.","The adjusted operating margin declined modestly by 10 basis points to 10.7% at constant from 10.8% for Legacy-Coty. We saw solid margin performance in the combined company, reflecting improved top line trends in the Consumer Beauty division, and more normalized level of A&CP spend following alleviated A&CP pre-commitment in Q2.","From a segment perspective, Luxury reported an adjusted operating margin of 13.6%, consistent with the year-to-date trends and up 270 basis points versus Legacy-Coty, driven by strong gross margin expansion and reduced A&CP. Consumer Beauty posted an adjusted operating margin of 12.3% and up 350 basis points versus Legacy-Coty, with margin expansion in the combined company business further strengthened by the high margin contribution of Younique.","The Professional Beauty adjusted operating margin was slightly positive, as the seasonally weak period in the Salon market weighted on the margin profiles of both Salon Hair and ghd and due to some non-recurring cost items.","Fueled by our strong adjusted operating income performance, we reported an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.15 above the Legacy-Coty EPS of $0.14.","With regard to the synergies, we have begun to roll out our restructuring efforts with $155.8 million restructuring charge booked in Q3 and another $220 million to be booked in Q4.","Plans have also been announced at a number of manufacturing facilities around the world to rationalize those facilities as part of Coty's targeted manufacturing and distribution footprint. So as you can see, we have been active in both working towards the integration of the P&G business and achieving our targeted synergies. We have now realized close to $100 million in synergies in fiscal 2017 year to date versus the full year estimate of approximately $350 million.","Now turning to our balance sheet and our cash profile. As anticipated, the increased acquisition related operating and capital expenditure weighted on the cash generation this period, with a Q3 free cash flow use of $83 million, which still represented an improvement of $26 million versus the prior year.","We finished the third quarter with close to $800 million in cash on the balance sheet and approximately $6.4 billion in net debt. Consistent with last quarter, our balance sheet is very solid with a moderate leverage after all the recent acquisition made. I would like to point out that we still maintain our pro forma leverage profile of approximately 4 times, while adding ghd and Younique to our portfolio. The anticipated acquisition of the Burberry license in Q2 fiscal 2018 should not have material impact on our leverage profile.","All together, I am extremely pleased with what we are executing on the M&A strategy and we have outlined over the last few quarters of utilizing our strong cash flow and balance sheet to add businesses that improve the growth profile of the company and address white space opportunities in the portfolio, all while remaining disciplined on valuation.","As Camillo mentioned, the Burberry Beauty business is a great addition to the Luxury portfolio. The acquisition of a 60% stake in Younique expands our Consumer Beauty presence into a new channel direct-to-consumer e-commerce, and as shown in the 8-K we filed on April 13, Younique delivered 40% net revenue growth in calendar 2016 with a very strong 28.5% operating margin for the year.","The ghd acquisition expand the product assortment available for our Professional go-to-market platform with the business continuing to outperform the market. And as I mentioned earlier, the Hypermarcas business, which was acquired a year ago, has not only given Coty an incredibly important global beauty market but continues to perform exceptionally well.","In conclusion, let me reaffirm the new Coty business has a strong strategic and financial flexibility and we are very confident in the free cash flow profile of the company and strength of the balance sheet. Financial flexibility will allow us to gradually shift the growth profile of the company to be well positioned as a new global leader and challenger in beauty.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. So first just a detailed question, when you say organic sales trends will decelerate in Q4 versus Q3, are you using negative 2% as the basis for Q3 or is it the negative 3% ex timing?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No, what we're using in order to be able is that we are using the minus 2% as a reference, and what we say that we're going to sequentially weaken the top line in the \u2013 in Q4. So it's really very much in line with the comment that Camillo made that this journey is not a straight-line journey and we're still in the process of stabilizing the business. So I think the performance of Q3 was a good performance, but that doesn't prevail what's going to happen in the coming quarters. So we still \u2013 we're not in the straight line journey.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And, I guess, given that historical volatility you mentioned, can you give us a little more sense of what you're expecting in Q4 for organic revenue trends? Is it slightly worse than Q3 or is it materially worse and more like the first half of the year? I'm just trying to get some kind of sense given the volatility we've had historically over the last few quarters.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No. So, Dara, we're not going to go into guidance mode et cetera. So I think, as you know, we are in build-up mode, we are currently stabilizing the business, Consumer Beauty is still facing severe headwinds. So we just point out the fact that you should not derive from Q3 what's going to happen in Q4 and you should expect some weakening in terms of top line, but we're not going to say more than this.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the shelf space losses in the Consumer Beauty division, I assume that's basically going to continue to pressure the business for a few more quarters until you cycle it. So first, can you comment on that? And then second, as you look at the shelf space losses, are they more permanent in your mind or do you think as you implement some of the strategies and execution fixes at some point, they could come back?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Yes. So clearly, as you can imagine, the decision for the wall resets had been taken a while ago, several quarters ago actually by the retailers, before we control the P&G Beauty brands. And the distribution loss, which is primarily actually loss of shelf space, is not necessarily loss of doors, is primarily focused on COVERGIRL, Clairol in the U.S. and Max Factor, and a Germanic brand called ASTOR in Europe. This \u2013 that the shelf loss space, as you said, will last for a while because it takes time to just prepare the programs to change the trend in the sense. And all the decisions for the next few quarters have already been taken at the beginning of calendar 2017.","So going back to your questions, it will last for few more quarters because on one side, we will have to annualize the decision that have been taken before and on the other side, we are in a process of working very closely to our key retailers and presenting our programs, new pipeline, the brand relaunches that I mentioned few minutes ago and in order to just get back \u2013 to gain back some of this space.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, hi. Hi, good morning. So, I just wanted to talk about Brazil a little bit more. I think you're the first company that's talked positively about Brazil so far. And I know that last year, you had inventory destocking. So, could you maybe talk about trends excluding the inventory destocking? And then if you could just quantify for us how much the Brazil impact helped Consumer Beauty organic sales growth? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. So, we are having a very strong performance in Brazil, our sellouts or sell-through in market results is we're growing double-digit versus in market that is growing mid single-digits. So this is driven by the strength of the portfolio that we have there, which is a mix of local brands and international brands. And focusing for a second on the local brands that we have, these are very strong brands with a lot of heritage, which are very high quality and the right price positioning for the Brazilian consumers. So we are actually seeing a growth in market share in most of our key brands there and we hold quite a significant number of leading positions in Brazil. So for us, Brazil is a growing business and we're very pleased with it.","But at the same time, Patrice mentioned in his speech that we're also benefiting from a low comparison in the quarter \u2013 same quarter in the prior year, because when we bought the business, we went through a transformation in the trade terms policy that we had in the business there. So clearly, this is the comparison. And Patrice will cover the...","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. And if you want the quantification of this base comparison that has been favorable to this year, you can take for the Consumer Beauty trends 3 points for this quarter.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. First a short-term and then a more longer-term question. But first on the short-term, in terms of the Q4 sales outlook, I'm trying to understand sort of the delta, Q3 relative to Q4. I totally appreciate the fact that it's not going to be a straight line improvement. But as we talk through sort of some of the things that we're going through in Luxury, you have the addition of some fairly prestigious brand names as time progresses, Tiffany, Burberry et cetera. In Consumer, other than the Hypermarcas sort of comp issue, it sounds like there is not terribly a whole bunch that's changing, except, perhaps, maybe some more incremental shelf space losses in the legacy PG brands, while Professional doesn't sound like there is a whole lot changing. So just trying to understand sort of the puts and takes as we \u2013 in sort of the nearer-term outlook first? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","As Patrice said, Olivia, we are in the process of stabilizing the business and this is why it's not going to be a straight line, because we still have headwinds and we are working through all the challenges that we just mentioned a few minutes ago. The divisions are in different states. So, Luxury, I expect the improvement in Luxury to continue, but to be an improvement versus H1, first half. Professional, I believe Professional will consistently have positive performance, but Consumer Beauty will take time. And we're not going to talk here about how long it's going to take to turn around this business for all the reasons that I mentioned before. One of them is clearly the distribution losses that we just described, but also because the strategic actions that we have put in place will bear fruit at a later stage. And I'm referring, of course, to the repositioning of some of the brands, to the changes on the innovation process and therefore strengthening our pipeline, and of course the digital transformation and the revamping of the in-store execution. These are really significant undertaking that will not be able to bring fruit in the short term, and that is why Consumer Beauty will take time.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. In terms of Consumer Beauty, I know, you've been talking to your existing retailers about your goals in mass beauty. But are you in a position yet where you can talk to new distribution? Because at the end of the day, even if you improve your existing \u2013 your business at existing mass retail, that channel has come under a fair bit of pressure and faster, in many cases, smaller competitors are gaining traction in a couple of other channels?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Well, of course, we are talking to retailers about stabilizing the business, but at the same time we are seeing all the shift that consumers are making towards e-commerce. And so, e-commerce is such an important point of our strategy, of my strategy and such an important channel. As a matter of fact, we just announced a new head of e-commerce with the new organization behind him, with a much higher level of accountability. So, we're focusing quite a lot on working on \u2013 with our customers on e-retailing. But at the same time, we're making sure that e-commerce becomes a much bigger focus for us. And let's not forget that really Younique for us is a new business that is solely focused on e-commerce, it's a D2C, direct-to-consumers channel, which also clearly covers the social selling, because we have 250,000 presenters, which everyday sell color cosmetics under the Younique brand to their contacts and social contacts. So...","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. In the discussion of the Luxury business, it sounded from the way the release was written that Calvin Klein grew in the quarter, which I feel like maybe the first time Calvin Klein brand has grown in frankly several years. So, could you just talk about whether or not you think that brand has hit an inflection point, whether it was the timing of new launch activity versus the degree of kind of proactive clean-up of inventory in the channel you're working on? I'm just quite curious on the trajectory for that business in particular? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Lauren. Actually a few brands, not just Calvin Klein, grew in the quarter. Focusing on \u2013 and I mentioned some of them few minutes ago. Focusing on Calvin Klein, we had a good quarter. And we had a couple of launches CK All and CK Eternity Intense that had some early good results. But I could not say that the journey of recovery on Calvin Klein is progressing in the way that I want. On the contrary, Calvin Klein, we still have a lot of work to do. And we are in the process of changing it. And I think also it's quite important to say that the fashion house is also having a new momentum with arrival of Raf Simons and, of course, we're working very well together to prepare new programs. But these new programs have not been reached the shelf for the consumers yet.","Talking about the wholesale distribution reductions, this is a long-term program that we are undertaking, we're very serious about it. This is a focus of the new Coty. But by no means is finished this quarter, will continue for the next few quarters. So, we don't really comment on the size, but I can tell you that we are very keen to continue this journey and make substantial progresses.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And, Camillo, do you feel like that, that cleanup process of the wholesale inventory, one is, is that sort of a one-year, two-year, I mean, how should we think about that? Will it be kind of heavier typically in the first half of your fiscal year, just given the relative weight of the fragrance business at that time of the year? And then also, is there a risk that not having that distributive trade completely cleaned up dilutes some of the brand equity work that you are doing? So the new exciting positive work you are doing gets sort of diminished in the consumers' or retailers' mind, but they're still being discounting on some of the legacy products within those brand franchises?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","I'll start with answering the second and then I'll go to the first, because I think the first is consequential to the other one. So, first of all, yes, I believe that the heavy presence in wholesale distribution or gray market by some of our brands is detrimental to the equity of the brands. And this is why we have decided to step up in the effort of cleaning up or reducing the wholesale distribution. So the answer is yes on the negative effect on our brands. And but this is an industry problem, it's not just a Coty to Coty issue and what I can tell you is that we are very serious and we have started this process with a different level of intensity and \u2013 but it's not going to be just a few quarters. This is probably a few years type of process, because again it needs to be done in the right way with the right pace.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Shannon Coyne of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering about, you talked about the changes going on in the fragrance category overall, overall market growth, the change in trend to artisanal and what you're doing to address that? And, I guess, in that vein, you mentioned the Gucci Bloom launch. Can you give us an early read on that and anything you are doing \u2013 anything else you're doing to capitalize on the surge in the Gucci brand? It's been really strong. Just wondering if maybe there is something you're doing, you can capitalize that in the cosmetic space? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So, without any doubt, well, there are different trends, so I'll focus on factors in Gucci, I mean, clearly we're very confident and hopeful about the Gucci Bloom launch because the fashion house is growing incredibly well. You guys have all seen the fantastic result they have. And perhaps this is the first scent that actually has been conceptualized by the Creative Director, Alessandro Michele. And it's \u2013 we just launched last week, so I don't have an early read. I'll be very happy to provide it when we have it. What we \u2013 what I can say is that this is going to be a very strong launch for us and we are very \u2013 we're preparing a very, very strong launch plan for the season, I guess, and it's going to be launched in the next couple of months. And one of the focus on being inclusive and customer-centric communications strategy on millennials, which will include some element of personalization and customization.","So this is a launch that's going to have a very strong digital drive, I would say, component and cannot really disclose much more, but I'm looking forward to see this in the market and to see the reaction and the consumers really loving it.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then, you talked a lot about digital, can you talk about the shift, the amount of money \u2013 the amount of dollars you've been able to shift toward digital media away from traditional? And maybe, perhaps, what you're doing to increase organic content versus paid content with the major beauty influencers in the cosmetic space?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So, overall, as total company, we're now in the range of 30% in terms of digital spending as a percentage of total media, but on some of the brands, in the color cosmetic brands, we're actually above 50%, because clearly we are spending where consumers are now spending their time, which I think is very important. In terms of the way we're approaching the digital transformation, so the end-to-end approach, let's say, we're doing a couple of things, which are different versus how we did in the past.","First of all, we have now a trend lab, where we're trying to understand better consumer insights, consumer trend, we do these 24x7, so we're able to really provide much stronger level of insights and trends to the marketeers, and that really leads to several things, so one of them, it leads to creating better content, and better content, the results of the right content for the right consumers, so that we can target better, but also the right content for the right platform, because clearly consumers spend and they have different behavior on the different platform. And this is really allowing us to optimize and to get early \u2013 strong early results, I would say. And I think that probably answer your questions unless you have a different angle that I'm not covering.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to quickly go back to Q4 organic sales growth. And obviously, we understand during this transition period, you're going to have some choppy results, I mean. But from that standpoint, I guess, that could imply both sequential improvements or a sequential decline. So, obviously, you have some sort of visibility into Q4 indicating that there is some sort of decline going on. And I'm just wondering maybe is it driven by category weakness or something else. And if you won't talk specifically to Q4, maybe if you could talk to Q3 about maybe what came in a little bit higher than expected, I guess, obviously, the comp was real easy in Brazil and they \u2013 maybe that's getting harder in Q4. Is there any sort of granularity you could give us into the reason you're expecting this slow down into Q4? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","In terms of Q4, Joe, I will say basically what Patrice said because we are in the process of stabilizing the business. And I just mentioned before, we expect Q4 to be worse than Q3 and it's driven by the different dynamic that we have in the division. So Luxury will show an improvement compared to H1, Professional will continue to have a consistent positive performance, but Consumer Beauty will take time. And the different challenges that we're facing, it means that it will take time for us to turn around this business.","Focusing on the second part of your questions, areas where we are having success that I would like to highlight is, for example, in Luxury, which is the business that has grown 2% on the last quarter, travel retail is having a very, very strong performance. This is for us really good. We recently changed the way that we manage travel retail in the sense that we have created higher accountability, we now treat travel retail as an independent channel, and this is bringing stronger results in market through the work of the team, but also better execution, I would say.","At the same time, in Luxury, we're having a good performance in China. One of the things that I mentioned in one of the previous call is that, we recently moved from distributor to affiliates, so we have built our own in-house team in China to take care of the go-to-market, and we're certainly having some good results. So there are \u2013 the focus of success in Luxury, beside innovation, that is driving the good performance in Q3.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, just one follow-up on the strategy in Consumer Beauty. I guess, maybe if you can talk a little bit about why you're making the management change this early into the transition? And what the new President brings to the business that you didn't have before? And I guess, you're making this transition to a new President of the division, while there is a lot of changes going on in the business and obviously struggles, and you have a lot of strategic initiatives in place. I mean, do you expect additional strategic initiatives on top of the ones that are already in motion, maybe adding to some complexity of this turnaround process in Consumer Beauty? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","No, I'm very pleased that Laurent Kleitman is coming on board. Esi has done a very good job in helping us through this transition and the set up of the Consumer Beauty, but I'm really looking forward for Laurent to come on board. I mean, he has truly extensive experience in beauty, especially in hair that's the business that \u2013 very large business that he used to manage in Unilever, plus he has worked both in developed and developing markets, so experience of having lead truly in the countries, in the different regions, therefore understanding consumers from different angles, and he has managed very, very large P&Ls. So to me he has absolutely the right leadership to lead the turnaround of our largest division, I'm very confident of the benefit that he will bring us to coming on board.","In terms of changes in the strategy that his arrival could bring, I don't expect a massive change in the strategy, because it's very clear that we have a four-pillar strategy. And we are progressing on all the four pillars, as I mentioned before. And I'm pleased with the progress, but at the same time, of course, a new leader I hope that he brings us a new fresh set of ideas that could complement all the things that we're doing and help us to be successful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask just a housekeeping question first. Is there any update on total synergies, phasing or planned reinvestment?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No, there is no update on that.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And anything on the divestitures as well in terms of timing or size of those?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No, as we said \u2013 as I've said before, this is a long process. We are currently handling that. So I think all that I've said before remains true, is that the scope has been defined. And now we are in the process of assessing the different options and started to prepare for it, so I think, more to come.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then just a broader question. So, when you talk about the re-launch of COVERGIRL, what gives confidence that that re-launch can change the sales trajectory of the brand? Is there anything that you can specifically point to that gives confidence that what you're doing or will do will work? And can you cite examples of big brands within the space that have had success with re-launches, meaning that there is some confidence that this is just even possible relative to trends sort of moving away from the big brands to smaller niche brands?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. I think we're confident, because clearly we have seen the plans. This is new positioning, new creative, new packaging, new in-store look. This is quite a significant transformation and changes toward the brand. At the same time, we will, of course, respect some of the element of the history of COVERGIRL but we're going to become way more modern and more in touch with the consumers based on what's happening right now.","The confidence comes also from having presented this plan to all the top retailers in the U.S., including I was personally at the NCDS (48:32) recently just a few weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago in Arizona, and I can tell you that the reaction from all the retailers has been very positive to COVERGIRL, and in general, I would say, positive on the progress that we're making, Coty, in just in the space of six months. And I think the feedback has been positive unanimously by all the retailers. So, this just helps our, of course, internal confidence, because we believe the trends are very strong.","At the same time, we're also not only changing the content and the way the COVERGIRL will talk to consumers, but also the way that we invest our money, the shift that we will do to digital. And we already started somewhat with COVERGIRL, in our opinion, will bear specific fruits. And let's not forget that all our data tells us, all our research data tells us that COVERGIRL is still the most loved brand in color cosmetic mass in the United States, and that is a big equity piece that will help us definitely to turnaround this brand in the future.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I guess, the first question I was going to ask is on the professional hair care, the success you had in this quarter, when some of your competitors, including L'Or\u00e9al, talked about softer trends out there. So I was just wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit about what's happening in the marketplace. Are you expecting any type of reaction from the competition to kind of maybe regain some share that they may have lost? So, I was wondering if you can give a little perspective on that.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","In the Professional, as I mentioned, there is kind of two sides, so clearly we're doing well. We have low-single-digit growth in the hair portfolio. And this is driven by a very stable and confident, very highly-skilled organization that we have, that continues to work with our customers to gain doors and also to roll out some of the strong initiative we have in the pipeline. And NIOXIN did very well, Wella color continues to do very well and we are rolling out System Professional, which is a customized line of hair care, so shampoos and other type of solutions, hair solutions. And this continues to go very well.","So for us, it's a positive momentum. We know that the market is actually not growing much in the Professional area. But we continue with our strategy, which, for us, is on a positive track. On the other side, clearly, I'm not happy with the performance of OPI. OPI is a new brand for this division and we are going \u2013 we have some headwinds, we are going through some challenges, which is partly driven by having to absorb and integrate the brand and also changing, in some cases, the go-to-market, because in some cases we're also working to change from distributors to a different type of go-to-market that is more led by us. So I expect OPI clearly \u2013 we're preparing very strong plans and expect OPI to have some improvement in the performance in the next few quarters.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, I guess, the next question is really on just the slower traffic that we're seeing at brick-and-mortar retail, whether it's the mass business, and obviously you've seen, probably, some of it with Consumer Beauty, but even the specialty, where you're selling some of the hair care products. Can you talk maybe a little bit about some of the dialogs that you're having with those retailers as you're seeing sales getting shifted a little bit more to online in terms of merchandising support? If they're coming to you and asking for more cooperation or more partnership in terms of trying to drive traffic back in the store? And I guess, a little bit of update and color on that would be appreciated. Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So, I'll start with the shift to online, yeah, so to e-commerce. It's no doubt that we are intensifying our conversation with the customers in terms of working with the \u2013 on the e-retailing part of it. So, I would say, maybe in the past there could have not been a strong focus within all the conversation. Now, you can see conversation for all the programs we put in place in the brick-and-mortar paired, but similar level of type of focused conversation on the programs that we bring to the e-commerce. So without any doubt, this means more time, more resources, more allocation, more investment. So, this is probably a good piece, the answer of your questions.","The other question is how to drive traffic to the brick-and-mortar. No doubt that's part of our job, so it's our role as well. So, this is not only our partners, retailers, customers talking to us about it, but also it's about our teams going there with ideas on how to drive more traffic into the retailers. And in-store executions, connecting more with millennials, doing exclusive programs, and tailor-made more targeted programs to specific target consumers. Clearly, all this type of conversation are going to help to \u2013 yeah, to revert some of these performances.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rosie Edwards of Berenberg. Your line is now open.","Rosie Edwards - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Yes. Good morning. Just two quick ones from me. And just firstly on online, could you just give us an idea how much of the combined business it currently represents as a percentage of sales and what its current growth rate is? I think you said in China, it was over 20%, but anything you can give on the group that would be very helpful?","And then secondly, just going back to Professional, it seems now the profit in Salon Hair was also under pressure despite, obviously, the fairly good top-line growth that we've just discussed. So just to understand what was weighing on pressure there \u2013 on profit there, sorry?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","I'll cover the first question. Patrice will cover the second. In terms of e-commerce sales as a percentage of our sales, we actually don't disclose the percentage or our go-forward targets. But I want to confirm that this is a major focus for me and for the organization. And as I said before in one of the other question is, we have recently announced our new head of e-commerce, a new organizational structure and therefore I expect a much stronger focus and improvement in the trajectory of this channel. And you want to talk about the rest?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. So, good question on the Professional profitability. So actually a significant chunk of the decline in profitability is really related to the seasonality of the business. So, this is something that we are learning on the Professional side of the business, that we're in everything, and this seasonality is true not only for the hair part of the salon, but as well as for ghd and this is much higher than what we thought initially, and so we are currently working to mitigate these quarterly fluctuations in the near future. The other reason why is due to a couple of one-off non-recurring cost items that we should not see in the coming quarters.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I was just trying to go back to some of the headlines crossing about inventory levels at the trade, saying do you have a lot more inventory to digest. So, I was hoping to get some color on the levels and if you would expect greater than the 1% impact of the advance sales, especially in the U.S.?","And boding into that just on the \u2013 back to the comment in Brazil, I just want to clarify that you mentioned 300 basis points benefit that would imply close to double-digit in the Consumer Beauty business overall, declining close to double digits, is that correct? And if \u2013 well I know Brazil is on a big recession and you launched some nail polish there, but I was hoping to see some if you can comment as you normalize the first quarter will likely normalize, which is the second quarter calendar in Brazil because of these launches and because of these stockings, so if you can go back to that comment just to clarify if that is actually boding to your comment about the fourth quarter being weaker than the third? Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So I will just start by giving you the answer on the base comparison effect of Brazil. This is indeed a positive of 300 basis points for the quarter for Consumer Beauty only, okay. So that's the answer to your question. Then I will now leave the floor to Camillo to answer the other part of your question.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Your first question, Andrea, was about inventory level and the fact that in Q2 we suffered from a very high inventory level from Q1. So clearly we have now had another quarter, so Q3 in which we flushed out. I would say good part of the inventory build-up that we had to deal in Q2 is not finished. We still have a bit to do, which we hopefully will be able to flush through in Q4, so Q4 will be slightly impacted there as well. But I'm pleased with the performance in Q3, because we were able at least to take care of a good part of the problem that we had narrated in the previous quarter.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Quarterly Earnings Conference Call.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Monaco. Mr. Monaco, you may begin your conference.","Kevin Monaco - Coty, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Camillo Pane, Chief Executive Officer; and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where we list factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. All commentary on organic net revenues reflect the comparison of Legacy-Coty and the P&G Beauty Business on a combined net revenue basis at constant currency in both the current and prior-year periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions, other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business.","In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Camillo.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2018 first quarter's earnings call. Q1 was a much better quarter. We saw strong growth in Luxury, continued positive momentum in Professional and a reduced net revenue decline in the Consumer Beauty division.","We delivered significant improvement in profits, driven by better gross margin performance and strong financial discipline on the cost structure. We also continued making meaningful progress in our merger integration, and I'm glad to announce that, as of September 1, we have exited our third and final TSA for the ALMEA region.","Starting with Luxury, this was the third consecutive quarter of positive top line growth. Luxury revenues increased 4% on an organic basis, driven by a successful innovation pipeline, excellent performance from several brands, and best-in-class in-store execution behind our launches, leading to double-digit growth in several countries.","We also introduced two successful major new products this quarter: Gucci Bloom and Tiffany's debut fragrance. Gucci Bloom was the best fragrance launch ever in Macy's, the biggest Coty launch ever in Harrods, and the top two new product launch in every retailer we launched globally. The Tiffany's launch was the biggest opening day and first week in five years at Bloomingdale's, and has been a top seller at several other key retailers globally, including travel retail.","Our growth in Luxury is not limited to new launches. In fact, philosophy had a very strong quarter, growing net revenues double digits driven by strong sell-through in the U.S., both in the retail channel and direct-to-consumer. Additionally, we also launched new campaigns for HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy, which are driving very healthy growth in these pillars. These are clear results of what the new Coty is able to achieve.","In our Professional division, the first quarter marked the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth with net revenues increasing 1% organically. Our hair business grew across all regions and we are seeing continued strong momentum on Wella Professionals, particularly in color. In addition, System Professional continues making good progress on its global rollout, growing double digits in the quarter. Additionally, OPI has continued to grow in North America, with international markets being our next area of focus.","Consumer Beauty net revenue declined 8% on an organic basis and this remains a key focus for us. The decline was driven by declines in some of our brands, particularly retail hair, combined with continued weakness in the global mass beauty market. Although I'm not happy with the Consumer Beauty divisional performance to date, I'm starting to see signs of a stabilizing business. We're achieving this by actively engaging with retailer customers to amplify the in-store shopping experience to drive capital growth, working on accelerating our time to market with on-trend collections and new products, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation, and driving our e-commerce efforts.","For instance, in line with our goal to be faster to market, we were able to bring Clairol recent Color Crave hair makeup innovation to market in just six months. Where available, this exciting new product has outperformed its main competitor. And, as such, we expect to see increased shelf space allocation, which coupled with a game-changing innovation coming to Clairol in the second half, should further boost the brand.","While we continue to address challenges in North America and Europe, ALMEA continues to have several bright spots with highlights in Mexico, Australia, and Brazil. Speaking of Brazil, this business continues to be a standout success story for Coty. Our year-to-date sellout is growing at double the rate of the underlying market. With a strong pipeline of innovations in our local and global brands, we remain confident in this story and, as an example, we just became the second largest player by volume in the deodorant market, doubling our share in 18 months after increasing our focus on this segment three years ago. I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished in Brazil and believe it's a clear example of what the company is capable of achieving via strategic M&A and focus on execution.","As you know, we are also preparing the relaunch of several brands. In the recently announced COVERGIRL relaunch is another example of the strength of the new Coty. The brand's new statement of purpose, I Am What I Make Up, is COVERGIRL's biggest reinvention in its 60 years history. Our powerful relaunch film featuring six boundary breaking in cultural change agents COVERGIRLs result in astounding 4.1 billion impressions and 11 million views in a matter of few days. I'm looking forward to sharing more good news in the second half of fiscal 2018 as the product and fixtures are rolled out in stores.","We expect the combination of this brand initiatives, improving in market execution and consumer-focused communication strategy to support the gradual improvement in Consumer Beauty revenue trends. As I said before, it will still take time for the full recovery of the Consumer Beauty division.","These positive results are directly linked to the growth strategy we've been articulating to you in the past several quarters, focus on repositioning select brands in order to reconnect them with consumers, building on their already strong brand equity, making significant changes to our innovation product development process in parts of the organization driven by faster and state-of-the-art execution, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation including e-commerce, collaborating even more closely with retailers to significantly ramp up our in-store execution.","I want to be clear that there is still much work to be done to achieve our goals. We have only just started this journey and fiscal 2018 will be an important milestone in this regard. After having put the foundation of the new Coty in place, we expect this year to be one-off stabilization. And while results are likely to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter, the improving net revenue trends give me confidence that the growth strategy outlined above is moving Coty gradually into a path of full recovery.","With regards to our cost control, following a disappointing fourth quarter, I told you that we would make the issue a top priority, and we have. This quarter, our management team put in place a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our signature program, which is expected to lead to help improvement in our adjusted operating income over time.","I want to also highlight the positive results we are seeing from our M&A strategy. I'm pleased to say that Hypermarcas is driving very positive results in Brazil, where we're previously lacking scale, and ghd is bringing complementary technology and products to our Professional division.","Younique is another example of a great addition to the new Coty. From day one, Younique has been a purpose-led business focused on empowering women. Moreover, Younique's successful positioning and the intersection of social media and e-commerce is a best-in-class example of how brands can best connect with customers, a central objective for Coty as we work to reposition several of our key brands.","The continued growth in Younique active presenter base, which has increased nearly 20% since we began our partnership coupled with the continued strong double-digit top line growth, is a testament to the ongoing success and viability of this business model.","These strategic and complementary additions to our business fit our M&A criteria, and overall, our acquisition have performed very well. Further, the recent Burberry acquisition complements our expertise and leadership in luxury fragrances, accelerates our presence in the premium category and provides a strong platform to enter into the fast growing prestige color cosmetic category.","All of these plans, launches, and accomplishment would not be possible without the new culture and mindset that we've worked so hard to nurture at Coty. Our new value of own it and drive it, which focuses on accountability and execution, will be one of the keys to delivering sustainable growth and industry-leading margins over time.","We also have a great company purpose of celebrating and liberating the diversity of your beauty, which has been received extremely well by our employees and which distinguishes us in the industry. At Coty, we have decided to take a stand to fight prejudice with a specific focus on ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation and gender inequality. And I'm excited that we're partnering with Global Citizen to fight the prejudice and discrimination that creates barrier to self-expression, individuality, and inclusion.","Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect to continue to deliver on our announced synergies, finalize the streamlining of our brand portfolio and re-launch several of our key brands. With this program, we aim to deliver improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to prior year, as well as a healthy margin improvement over the balance of the year.","In closing, while there is much work to be done, I firmly believe our strategy is working. And I'm confident that all our efforts will lead to Coty becoming a new global leader and challenger in beauty.","I will now turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Camillo, and good morning everyone. Q1 was a much better quarter with all key metrics, revenues, gross and operating margin and operating cash flow making progress.","Before further elaborating on our results, let us start with our integration plan. After an enormous amount of work by our very dedicated team, I am thrilled to announce the successful exit of the third and final stage of our Transition Service Agreement with P&G in the ALMEA regions, following our exits from North America in May and Europe in July. This is an important moment for the new Coty, as we now have control over our data, processes and systems. With TSAs behind us, we will now work on the completion of the integration to fully leverage the simplified and optimized infrastructure, continue to stabilize the combined business and build on some of the momentum we are seeing across the portfolio.","As Camillo already mentioned, we significantly increased our efforts on the cost structure as part of our existing synergy program with many ongoing initiatives, from significantly strengthening cost control measures on expenses, consolidated commercial office facilities to gain scale and efficiency, and deploying a number of global centers of excellence teams to help optimize our local operations, including the streamlining of our field sales force. Some of these initiatives, in addition to the continued execution of our growth strategies across our business lines, have already led to tangible signs of progress during the first quarter, when our overall profitability made good progress even though the bulk of our synergies from the P&G Beauty merger have yet to be achieved.","Our focus now is on driving consistent profitable growth across our business, while maintaining a very strong cost discipline in order to achieve our ambition of best-in-class operating margin. Indeed, it is fair to say reaching best-in-class operating margin is what is driving our business decisions.","Now, on to our results. First quarter net revenues were $2.2 billion, a 107% increase versus last year, largely attributable to the acquisition of the P&G Beauty business, while our organic net revenues declined 2%. Adjusted gross margin was 61.6%, represented a 280 basis point improvement year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of increase, driven by supply chain and procurement synergies as well as our acquisition strategy.","A tight financial discipline allowed us to generate an adjusted operating income of $195 million, well above Coty stand-alone with a 17% growth, resulting in a 9% adjusted operating margin. The increase is even more pronounced if we take into account that the inherited business from P&G was loss-making in Q1 prior year. This improved operating profit performance is good evidence that we are taking our operating margin ambition very seriously.","Interest expense of $66 million reflects higher debt balance incurred as part of the financing of the P&G Beauty, ghd, and Younique transactions. Our effective tax rate of 27% in line with expectations result in an adjusted net income for the quarter of $76 million or an equivalent adjusted earnings per share of $0.10, ahead of expectations.","We continued to achieve strong working capital improvement to free up cash to deleverage the business. Our average working capital was negative for Q1, and we believe there are still some more working capital improvement to come. During the quarter, we also continued to return cash to shareholders, paying $94 million in dividends.","I'd like to add a few additional details to our performance in our three divisions. First, in Luxury, our gross margin in the first quarter has improved, thanks to our creative innovation and good productivity improvement in the supply chain. This, combined with a strong emphasis on our cost structure, delivered an adjusted operating income of $90 million, roughly in line with the prior year, while absorbing the losses of the inherited P&G business. We are positive about the momentum as our investment behind innovation and new marketing campaigns began to bear fruit this year.","Our Professional division revenues grew moderately with the gross margin slightly improving and an adjusted operating income of $17 million. The level of profitability has been Impacted by the ghd seasonality, Q1 being the lowest quarter of the year from a revenue standpoint.","Despite the revenue challenges in Consumer Beauty, adjusted operating income increased 54% to $88 million, resulting in a 9% adjusted operating income margin due to structural improvement in our gross margin, as well as the continued success of Younique, which maintained double-digit top line growth, while continuing to be accretive to overall margins.","Finally, as said before, we continue to focus on pursuing a rationalization whether via divestiture or discontinuation of 6% to 8% of the combined portfolio, which we expect to announce by the close of fiscal 2018. This initiative should help to improve our revenue growth trajectory over time.","To conclude, this quarter has put an important milestone behind us with the successful TSA's exit. We are now focusing on building our new foundation to match our ambition of being a serious challenger and delivering best-in-class operating margin.","As Camillo said, we aim to deliver improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, as well as a healthy operating margin improvement over the balance of the year with a more pronounced positive impact in Q4, thanks to synergies delivery and favorable base comparison.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Joe Lachky. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. I'm with Wells Fargo Securities. Could you talk about your long-term EPS target and whether you still expect to hit $1.53 in EPS in fiscal 2020? I mean, obviously, you've seen some unexpected weakness in the business since you laid out those goals. I was wondering how much underlying improvement you'll need to hit the target, and I was also wondering how aggressive you plan to be with M&A in order to achieve your EPS goal and what other balance sheet activities you might consider using to get there?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks for the question, Joe. Let me start by reiterating what Patrice said, which is that our long-term focus is on achieving best-in-class sustainable operating margins. And then this is in line with our investment thesis that we referred in our road show at the time of the merger. And this is how we are making business decisions. Now, it's fair to say, as you know, that we have inherited a business which was smaller in revenues, but not in SG&A and, therefore, smaller in operating margin than our expectation at the time of the road show. And because of this, when you combine also with the business challenges that we have faced last year and our better visibility into the aspect of the business that we have now since we exited the TSA, we believe that it will take us longer to get to the $1.53, even with our objectives of best-in-class operating margin of higher teens.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yes. And let me reinforce that reaching high teens as the best-in-class operating margin is our primary objective and our announced synergies are one-off if not the most important milestone to get there. Let me also add to what Camillo has just said and as we have said in the previous calls that in order to achieve our EPS target, we may also use different levers over time, including our balance sheet for strategic accretive M&A. And as you know, it's very difficult to put a precise timetable on the M&A agenda.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's fair. Thanks. And you touched on the progress you're making in addressing the high-fixed cost issue that emerged last quarter. But I wonder if you still expect that to be a headwind going forward. And maybe if you could expand on some of the specific actions you've taken in Q1 or plan on taking in fiscal 2018 outside of synergies in order to reduce fixed costs? And then finally along those lines, do you think you need top line growth or at least top line stabilization in order to fully rationalize your cost structure? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Joe. So, that's a lot of questions. So, let me try to take one after the other. So, first on the cost structure. So, we told you that we would make this issue a top priority and we have. This quarter, the management team has put in place a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our synergy program, which is expected to lead to a healthy improvement in our adjusted operating income over time. So, what we have done is to significantly strengthen our cost control measures on expenses.","We have also taken some measures to consolidate some commercial office facilities to gain scale and efficiency as I said in the script, and also deploying a number of global standard of excellence teams to help optimize our local operations, including the streamlining of our sales force. So, some of these initiatives have already led to tangible signs of progress during the first quarter and we are going to make some further progress in the year to come and our overall profitability will make good progress even though, as we said before, the bulk of our synergies from the P&G Beauty merger have yet to be achieved and are more second-half-of-the-year skewed.","It's also fair to say that I'm not sure that the Q4 was a good benchmark and Q4 results reflected a certain non-recurring cost that were not included as onetime. For example, there were a number of Coty employees who were not fully dedicated to the integration, but who worked somehow on the integration, part time, and we did incur some costs related to supporting the TSA exit. So, now all this is over because we have successfully exited all the TSA, and now we can really focus on driving the business going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Hi. It's Deutsche Bank. Thanks. So, Camillo, I just wanted to talk to you a little bit more about your organic growth expectations for the back half and your level of confidence in that. So, perhaps if you could talk a little bit more about COVERGIRL, how much of this is dependent on the COVERGIRL relaunch, what your expectations are for gaining shelf space versus is it just better velocity at existing retailers or are you expecting sort of increased shelf space or additional sort of distribution points, and then how much of this is, perhaps, e-commerce-dependent?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Okay. I'll answer all your question in more or less the order you asked me, okay? So, regarding the outlook, we expect to continue to deliver on the previously-announced synergies. We're going to finalize on the streamlining of our brand portfolio and relaunch several of the key brands and I'll get to the relaunch in a second. Now, if we take all these programs together, we aim to deliver; improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year, as I said, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to prior year, which means roughly flat.","And when I look at the different promos that we're doing, clearly we have an improvement in the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty, that is a part of the objective that I just discussed and within Consumer Beauty we have a couple of relaunches which are quite important; the first one is, the COVERGIRL, which we just announced in October and I mentioned early a very positive sign of a reaction from the market on COVERGIRL.","And but we also have the relaunch of Clairol. On Clairol, we just launched a product called Color Crave which is an hair makeup product, which we launched off the classical less shelf reset windows with the U.S. retailers. And clearly we expect to gain some shelf space with this product once it's able to go in the normal shelf. Plus we are going to relaunch, also launch a second big innovation on Clairol in the second half of fiscal 2018 and therefore we expect these two relaunches to help us improving the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty.","Looking at the shelf space, I think it's important to remind that the shelf space decisions that impacted us were made prior to our acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business and the impact of those decisions continue to impact our results today and will continue for a while, because we need to annualize those decisions in the second half of 2018. And you know that not all the retailers redo their shelf at the same time. But based on encouraging conversations that we had with retailers regarding the restaging of the COVERGIRL and Clairol and other various brands and also, sharing our innovation pipeline, we believe that we should retain most of the space for our key brands.","And the last question, I think, was e-commerce. E-commerce is important for us. It's an area of focus for me and for the business. I already mentioned this in previous calls. And we don't disclose e-commerce sales, but I can confirm they were growing at a healthy above the market rate in both our Consumer Beauty and Luxury division, although from a low base. I hope that I have answered all your questions.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Christopher M. Carey - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. It's Chris Carey on for Olivia, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. So, I just wanted to follow up on that question around Consumer Beauty, specifically on that retail hair color side. So, like, what do you think is needed to get this business turned around? Obviously, you just mentioned some launches planned for the back half, but it seems like the category as a whole remain somewhat challenged. And connected to that, can you maybe frame the ability of Consumer Beauty to return to organic sales growth if you don't get the requisite lift from the retail color?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Talking about retail color, I think there is a couple of things. And one of the things that I did mention in the past that this category has been always treated very, very functionally by everybody. And, I think this needs to be treated more as a beauty category. Now, this transformation is not immediate.","And regarding our brands, Clairol, this has been a brand that didn't receive a lot of investment attention for many years. And I did refer to this brand in the past as a neglected brand. So, from our point of view, we have a much stronger pipeline. I did mention one of the launches that happened in the last few months and I did kind of give a preview that's going to be a big launch coming in the second half of 2018. But I believe that we have a very strong pipeline, which covers both the functional and the beauty area or the beauty part of this brand and this category.","And I think that our plans are strong, and that's why we believe that over time, we will be able to recover lost ground on this brand, and we've clearly come back to much more positive performance. So, I believe that the experience in the store and innovation are both part. And clearly, you have the communications or the positioning. This brand also requires a bit of a different way of communicating to consumers, and we are working also on the relaunch from that point of view coming in the second half of 2018.","Looking at Consumer Beauty, which is what you mentioned, as I said, because we're doing all this, we believe that we have a solid strategy in place and we are excited about the relaunches of several of our Consumer Beauty brands. And that's why we aim for the net revenue trends to improve over the year. But as I said, it will still take time for a full recovery of Consumer Beauty.","Christopher M. Carey - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Got it. Thanks. And then, if I could, just one follow-up, just in the context of your comments around the mass beauty market being sluggish. Can you talk about your abilities, M&A, to trade up the portfolio and maybe capitalize on growth opportunities in prestige? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, on the M&A front, what I would say, that for the time, clearly there are some opportunities. But for the time being, our main objective is to make sure that the new Coty is delivering its ambition of best-in-class operating margin on an organic basis, and we are really focusing on deleveraging the business. So, that's the current priority that we are currently working on. What you should also think about is that Younique, at one point in time, is going to come on the like-for-like basis. We are going to anniversarize the partnership with Younique and that is clearly a tangible sign that first, we are shifting the portfolio, the growth profile of the portfolio. And this is clearly going to impact positively in the second half of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. It's Morgan Stanley. Good morning, guys.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Good morning, Dara.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Good morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, in the release and here on the call, you mentioned a path to full recovery. Can you give us a bit more detail on what full recovery means exactly from a top line standpoint? Do you expect to maintain share in your product categories when you look out longer term? Do you expect to gain share? And also, can you give us an update on what category growth is now on a weighted basis when you look across your geographies and product categories based on trends the last couple quarters? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Look, full recovery, as I said, we are defining 2018 as a year of stabilization. And that's why we believe that our sales in the second half will be roughly comparable with previous year, roughly flat. And in terms of category growth, we believe that we are exposed more or less to around 2% of growth. So over time, we expect of course to generate a similar level to the category growth, and then over time to grow share as well and become over-performing versus the market that we are exposed. But we're not going to put a timeline behind this path. What is important is, for us, that 2018 is giving us signs, is making us confident about stabilizing the business so that we can therefore take it from there and go to the next step.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. And to complement on that, Dara, and when we speak about full recovery, we are already seeing some pockets of growth and we have already two legs out of three that are growing. The Professional Beauty business is already growing since a couple of quarters. You have Luxury that is having a very good momentum and we have commented on that and we see these momentums continuing. Now, as Camillo said, what we need is to focus on Consumer Beauty and here also, we see some good signs. So, the full recovery means that the three division will be in a much better shape and able to fight back. So, that's what we mean by full recovery.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. with Citigroup. I have, I think, three very simple and straightforward questions. First, with the rollout of COVERGIRL, the new products coming as we turn into 2018, do you expect inventory destocking to negatively impact returns in that business or is there just going to be a one-in\/one-out type of program, let's say, over the next couple of quarters?","Second on Burberry, when should we start to include some sales from Burberry in our model and how much inventory destocking do you think there might to be of that from its prior distribution?","And then just lastly, the M&A, the 6% to 8% of your revenues that you expect to sort of announce plans to get rid of, is that going to also lead to a 6% to 8% reduction in your EPS or did those brands or businesses have lower margins than the rest? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So, taking your first question Wendy, in terms of rollout of COVERGIRL, yes, there will be some inventory destocking in the coming quarter, preparing for the arrival of old and new products, the new packaging, the new visuals on the shelf. And in terms of how we are implementing this launch, there will always be some parts of the brand which is all the new innovation pipeline, which will be in and out, which means it's going to be a cut, right. And then the rest will be probably more of a phase-in and you can understand why depending on cost and inventory or on implementation as well.","And in terms of \u2013 your second question was about Burberry, and regards to the inventory and when we expect some sales, as you can imagine, we only became the owner of Burberry. So, we are in the process of understanding the level of stock there is in the market. So we're not able to make any comments about it. And so, we expect it to prepare our plans that we are already preparing, which will be strong plans. And at some point, really, we will start recording sales. But I don't have a visibility to give you about the exact month when we will be able to do that because, exactly, all the questions you asked on the stock.","Regarding the third question, Patrice, do you want to take the one about the 6% to 8%?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yes. So, the 6% to 8%. So, as we said, we are going to finalize this by the end of this fiscal year 2018. And so, we did not comment about the profitability so far of these brands and the potential EPS impact. The only thing that we said so far is that we intend to target to offset any earnings dilution from this portfolio rationalization with the acquisition that we have made, Younique, ghd and the Burberry Beauty license, but we did not yet comment on any timing on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gere. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Hi, it's KeyBanc Capital Markets. Just two questions. One, if we can go back to Consumer Beauty. Just while you're going through the restage of COVERGIRL, some of your peers are doing restages as well. So, I was just wondering if you could talk maybe about the merchandising dynamic, the promotional expense, the cost affiliated with that while store traffic is a little bit softer? Others are trying to do the same thing you're doing. What gives you the confidence that you will see that improvement that comes through while your peers are doing the same?","And then secondly, just on the Professional business, I think that was, I think you talked about e-commerce really kind of in Consumer Beauty and also in Luxury. But, on the Professional side, are you seeing anything that the trends may shift a little bit more away from specialty retail to online? Is that something that you're engaging in in terms of driving some of the growth in the Professional side? I know there's a lot of new technology and apps where people can actually see what they look like with hair coloring styles et cetera, without actually having to go into the store. So, just wondering if that's something that you're seeing or something that you're actually contemplating? Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Jason, for the questions. So, regarding the restage of COVERGIRL, as you can imagine, it's a competitive restage. We have over 60,000 doors in the U.S., just in the U.S. where COVERGIRL is distributed. So, it's a complex one, but so far everything that we are preparing is absolutely being prepared very well and it's going in the right direction. And, yes, we're going to have an inventory reduction as I said before in my previous answer because that's what we're going to do to ensure that the arrival of all the new products and new packaging will fit faster and will paste faster into the billboards, the walls.","And what I can tell you why we're confident is, look, since we have announced the restage with the new positioning and the reaction has been truly, truly positive. I mean, we did something in terms of the positioning that is absolutely relevant and when we talk about the freedom of self-expression, when we talk about creating any version of yourself with makeup, but this is truly having the right reactions.","But the one that makes me more confident is the reaction of our retailers, the customers, our partners. They are also the ones that are telling us that the way we are preparing this is absolutely superior to anything that has been done before by Coty and I guess also they have visibility over what they see in the market from other brands. And this reaction makes me confident of course that we're going to have an increased productivity once we're able to bring the new news and the new visuals in the stores as well.","Your second question I think it was about e-commerce in Professional Beauty and look, yes, I did mention a healthy growth above market rate in Consumer Beauty and Luxury because that's clearly very good. In Professional Beauty, we also have a growing e-commerce business is smaller because, as you could imagine, Professional Beauty is mostly focused on salon professionals, so hairdressers, manicurists and so on.","But there has been some shift as well because some of the channels are blurring, so we're working actively in this area as well. And you mentioned an app to look at on how you look and therefore being able at look at yourself to choose the right shade and so on, we have something absolutely like that on our brand, Clairol, which is going very well because it's absolutely one of the new way that consumers want to engage with brands and we have absolutely some of this technology as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. It's Barclays. I was curious. The debt went up like over $600 million sequentially. And so, I'm not sure why. So, I'd love to get some color on that. I think Burberry is around $200 million and it would have happened in October. So, curious about the debt level.","And then, just any other kind of general comment you can give us on being able to delever. Working capital is already negative so, which is super impressive, but just not sure how much more of that can be a source of delivering? So, I'd love some color there. Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yes. So, actually, to answer your first question, so that was really mainly related to the Burberry acquisition and to the related costs of this transaction. So, that's really mainly Burberry-related.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. I think your second question, Lauren, was about the net working capital already negative, which is very good. This is a strong achievement, and we're very proud. But we're also confident that we have a bit more to go on net working capital, and we keep working on it. I think, as we said, we're still at the beginning of our journey, and we're putting in place a series of ideas and actions to improve this. So, I think, there is a bit more to come.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. And to give a little more color about that, Lauren. So, as you know, we have $500 million synergies on the working capital. We have achieved roughly a third of that so far. So, still two-third to come and this was mainly by using the levers of payables, which is on a more long-term basis. We also have to work on our inventory level. So, I think, this is fair to say that we still have some margin for improvement in working capital. And in Q1, what we achieved is, on average, a negative working capital, but we plan to continue on that topic. Clearly, there is still \u2013 I'm quite positive about our cash flow generation.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, with Jefferies. A two-part question. One is just clarification on the organic growth comments in the second half. I think, Patrice, you mentioned that Younique becomes organic in the beginning of February. Just give us some clarity on is that organic comments of stable including Younique?","And then secondly, in the release you mentioned just some quarter-to-quarter variability in how the performance might play out this year? I'm wondering if you're willing to give us a bit more clarity on Q2 and then, the comments that you made, the Q3, Q4 balance sounds like a bit more Q4-focused. Maybe just some color on what you expect to see variability-wise quarter-to-quarter. Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. So, thanks for the questions, Steph. So, I can start to answer the first one and then, I will leave Camillo for the second part of the question. So, you are absolutely correct. So, the like-for-like is going to include our M&A at one point in time, at the time of the anniversary. So, for Younique, it's clearly going to impact Q3 going forward. So, on this, that is absolutely correct. It's going to impact two months of Q3 and then the full Q4.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. I think your second question regards it's more of a quarterly outlook, which we really don't do. What I can tell you is, as we said, we aim to see an improved net revenue growth trends for the remainder of the year. And in the second half, our top line, we aim to be roughly flattish or comparable to the previous year. Now, when you look on a healthy margin improvement, which we aim to have over the balance of the year, this is where we aim, we expect to have a more pronounced impact in Q4 given the lower base of last year.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","And the impact of the synergy also in Q4.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, that's the combination of the two. That's the reason why we mentioned with a more pronounced impact in Q4.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","On the margin. Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Yeah. It's JPMorgan. So, just to circle back on your commentary about \u2013 I understand that you don't want to give us the cadence, but just like what you just mentioned to clarify on the destocking of COVERGIRL. So, thinking about the second quarter, it seems like you're implying that it could be worse than the first quarter. Is that fair to say that part of it is this destocking or if the $60,000 being restaged? And if you can also comment on the general deceleration of the industry, especially specific to color cosmetics, and some of your retailers trying to push more into private label.","And then my related question would be the money behind brands and related to top line. So, we saw this SG&A growth in the first quarter was even higher than the fourth end. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers here? Was this primarily related to the TSA? And how should we be thinking about SG&A going to the second quarter and third quarter in particular? So, I understand here you're lapping the initial integration of P&G that is still about 30 percentage points delta between the growth then and now. So, we're just trying to kind of make the bridge there. Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So, Andrea on your first question, which is the destock in Q2, this refers mostly to clearly some of the activities in the re-launches we're doing in the Consumer Beauty division and it's true we will have some destocking, but we still expect the net revenue trends of Consumer Beauty to improve as a trend over the year and in the next quarters, starting from Q2.","Regarding your second question, which is more of a question about the U.S. mass channel, you mentioned color cosmetics. Mass channel is a really important channel for all the beauty players and there has been some shift clearly in the way the consumer shop brands, e-commerce, specialty store and so on. But, there will always be a place for products with strong value propositions, so for beauty brands with this characteristic.","And so, our focus is truly to build a closer partnership with the retail customers and ensure that we create an amazing consumer experience, in store and online. So, this means right assortment. It means faster innovation. It means yes, yes, speed to market and so on. So, that's where our focus is and we're working with our retailer partners to really bring back up the traffic in store through doing this.","One of the things that we did recently is this new concept store in New York called The STORY, which is a sort of experiential playground in which we test a lot of digital innovation around color cosmetics in this let's say experiential store. And what we're trying to do is to see some of these ideas because now we have the learnings of consumer interacting there, can go back to the classical standard retailing environment. So, we are really working well to try to change this.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","And so, on your last question, we usually don't give a split within SG&A between our fixed cost structure and our brand investments. And actually, we are seeing a decrease in Q1 fiscal 2018 versus the level of Q4 fiscal 2017 even if I don't think the last quarter was a good benchmark. What I can share with you is that what you should anticipate in Q2 is to have an increases in the overall level of SG&A, not so much because of the cost structure, that should keep on declining, but much more behind the NCP and the level of support, because of course we are entering into a very heavy season and it's very important that we fuel the top line momentum. So, you should expect in the second quarter some increase in this overall line.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Thanks. And it's Stifel. I wanted to ask or maybe take a step back. So, I guess I'm surprised by the number of mentions regarding achieving best-in-class EBIT margin for the business given the modest improvement, so far, from a revenue standpoint, just generally slower category growth globally especially in the U.S. and maybe even in Europe directionally, if you exclude travel retail. And that your competitors also don't seem to be as focused on margin, and in fact, seem to be more willing to push the A&P spend than I think I've heard in the past. So, I guess, why is that still the right strategy here, to focus so intently on EBIT margin, when I think top line will ultimately be the driver of that business? I mean, maybe I'm missing something. You know your business better than I do, but I'm just sort of curious how that thinking has evolved I recall over the last 12 months since at least that road show.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Mark, so a great question. So actually, it's a good opportunity for me to reiterate that our investment thesis is still very valid. So, our investment thesis is that there is usually a direct correlation between gross margin and EBIT across the FMCG industry but in beauty industry. And what we want to demonstrate is that we should be in a position to achieve a best-in-class operating margin. Why? Because the level of investment that we currently have on our business is according to us roughly the right level of investment. There might be some difference between quarters here and there, between geographies, between segments. The overall, at Coty, Inc. boundaries, the level of investment that we have is about to be the right one, which means that the overall level of synergies of $750 million should fall bottom line. This represents roughly between 700 and 800 basis points of operating margin. That's where we see the best-in-class operating margin.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Over time.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rosie Edwards. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Rosie Edwards - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Yes. Good morning. It's Berenberg. Just regarding, just so again at the top line. It's noticeable that this quarter, you're talking much more optimistically about growth certainly versus Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2017. But if we look at the sort of group performance, the underlying declines are fairly similar in the sort of low single-digit range. So, what data are you seeing that perhaps we're not that gives you the confidence to outline this recovery? Is it sort of future orders, sell-in, market share? I'm just trying to get an idea of the level of confidence there.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","As I mentioned, Rosie, we have already two divisions, Luxury and Professional Beauty, that have been growing for quite a while. So, the key focus of their attention is Consumer Beauty. The confidence in Luxury and in Professional Beauty comes from having seen the performance of our brands in the market. I mentioned in my script that the launch of Gucci Bloom and the launch of Tiffany have been successful so far, but it's not just these two new product launches. We see market share growth in HUGO BOSS and Marc Jacobs Daisy and several other brands. So overall, our portfolio both in terms of the classic pillars in Luxury and, but also in the innovation it brings to market, that includes philosophy, is performing quite well and, of course, that gives us confidence.","When I look at Professional Beauty, the growth that we're having in hair, which is one of the two category that we work in Professional Beauty, is actually positive. And it has been positive now for several quarters. And this is the bulk of our business. This is where we believe we are growing market share, especially in color, which is the core part of Wella Professional. And we expect to have this positive momentum and performance to continue because of the strength of our brands, but also the strength of the capabilities that we have in the professional business, in the professional service business.","And regarding Consumer Beauty, it's really, first of all, there are some spring and some excellent results that we're seeing in, especially in ALMEA. And so, I mentioned Mexico, Australia, Brazil, but we have also some other, Bourjois continues to grow market share both in Europe, but also in Russia, Middle East. We have Rimmel having market share growth in several countries. So, there are several examples that clearly gives us this confidence of improving trends. But as I said, Consumer Beauty will take time before a full recovery. This is, clearly, the largest division we have. We have faced some challenges. We continue to face some challenges and that's why we're going to continue to implement all our actions to implement the recovery.","Rosie Edwards - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. Thank you. And just one follow-up on just, again, the sort of improved Q1 performance. Clearly, a noticeable improvement on the profitability. And just following on from the SG&A question earlier because, I think, in Q4 certainly you talked about fixed cost headwinds of, I think, nearly $700 million, and also above average marketing spend sort of around the 27% of sales. Are you able to give us any idea of those two elements of, certainly, the fixed cost headwind and marketing spend in Q1 2018?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","No. So, as we said, we don't give any split between the brand investment and the fixed cost structure. What I can tell you is that we made some significant progress on our cost structure and, I think, the results are very telling about this. What is also true to say and what I've mentioned in one of the previous question is that Q2, going forward, is usually a quarter where you put more money behind our brands in order to further fuel the top line because it's clear a quarter of a lot of activities and a very high season. But, clearly, when you compare Q4 and the Q1, our overall SG&A has gone down very significantly on the back of cost structure decline and tight financial discipline. What is also fair to say is that some of the investment that we deliberately made in Q4 are using results, some of them were in the Luxury division and this has clearly paid off when I see the top line momentum that we start to see in Q1 that we are targeting to see also in Q2.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thank you. Consumer Edge Research. My question is on Younique. It was $400 million you said at the time of the partnership growing. I think you said in the comments, strong double digits. Can you frame for us any better how much that's set to contribute in 2018 and maybe beyond that? Any detail within that around number of active presenters and any leading indicators and sorry if I missed that anywhere.","And does the success you're having here, I know as a management team, you've looked closely at direct selling of all kinds, big and small, your competitors and other companies. Does the success here tell us anything about maybe a future for a greater role for direct selling within Coty in the future? Thanks very much.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So, Jonathan, Younique is clearly an acquisition, a very strategic acquisition that we are very pleased with, and it continues to grow double digits. So, the performance that we mentioned at the time of the acquisition continues to be true now that it's clearly under the partnership with us.","In terms of additional KPIs that you ask, there is one that is very telling, which is the sign-ups, so the basic recruitment of presenters. And right now, we are approaching 100,000 presenters totally, overall, with over 100,000 presenters that joined us in Q1 2018 alone. So, I guess, I think combining the net revenue, double-digit growth and the growth of the presenters, that clearly makes us satisfied with the performance.","In terms of the role that direct selling can play within Coty, I think that we have made what I would call a very strategic and successful acquisition with Younique. We are very satisfied with it, and I believe direct selling has clearly a role to play within Coty given the growing size of Younique.","But the other reason why I believe that this is so relevant is because of the direct link between the presenters and the consumers, and this is very, very relevant in the current market where individualized and customized approach to consumers is a big trend. And having a 100,000 presenters who are our brand ambassadors, who talk to millions of consumers out there on a daily basis, almost on an individual basis, because sometimes they do virtual parties with few people, but most of the time is individual basis, to me is also key to the performance that we're seeing in Younique.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Maria, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Results Conference Call.","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, August 28, 2019. On today's call are Pierre Laubies, Chief Executive Officer; and Pierre-Andre Terisse, Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of the comments today may contain forward-looking statements.

And welcome everybody to Coty's fiscal 2019 full year and fourth quarter conference call.","Before letting Pierre-Andre, our CFO, dive into the divisional performance and financials, let me provide you with an update of where we are at and what we have been focusing on since the first time we spoke six months ago.","Our first priority at the time had been to stabilize the business operationally. This included resolving the various supply chain disruptions that meaningfully impacted our operations in the first half. Our service levels are now back in their high 90s across all divisions. Regaining control of profit and cash flow, and setting a relevant financial policy with a sustained dividend. Today, we can consider that these objectives have been achieved.","Our second priority has been to build a medium-term plan aimed at solving what we consider are our most pressing issues. By this we mean, the trajectory of our consumer beauty business, our gross margin gap and overly complex organizational design and a culture far too dependent upon personal genius versus quality of mastery.","We analyzed in detail our consumer beauty business and now have concrete plans in each of our key countries to stabilize our market shares and improve our profitability for 50% of our business. These plans have been rigorously structured and timed, and some parts are already in action.","For instance, in Q1, we are already accelerating our working media fiscal at the expense of promotion and discounts. Our plans have been shared with our key customers and I can say confidently that they have been well received. We will now deploy at a rapid pace these supports to the rest of our consumer beauty countries and we expect the same findings, the same resulting actions and the same margin upside per country.","As shared in our call in early July, we have identified substantial value uptake in our direct and indirect costs as well as G&A. And we shared with you the details of our strategy on the matter. Now, we are mobilizing internal and external resources to unlock it. This is mission critical to us as it will give us the margin that we need to invest in brand building, while at the same time improving our profitability.","Finally, we have built a leadership team, which will be leading a leaner and more aligned organization. It's key feature will be a set of values reinforcing team alignment and collective effort, closer proximity between markets and the Company's leadership, widespread competencies based on clear playbooks, and a more cohesive culture illustrated by a move to a global headquarter in Amsterdam.","We are finalizing the top two layers of our organization currently. Our organization transformation will be completed by the end of Q2 and we intend to start to move to our new HQ in the course of the third quarter of this fiscal year.","These two tasks being either completed or in execution mode, we will now be turning our attention to the next theme of our transformation - our innovation portfolio. We want to strengthen our pipeline through the lens of growing the penetration of our brands. Our brands have the capability to target across more geographies and more consumer segments and we want to leverage this opportunity.","Gucci, through its entry in color cosmetics; Clairol, with good touch-up and the recent launch of vegan and natural weDo\/ Professional hair care line are great example of this strategy and of our ability to marry vision, creativity and operational discipline.","As you can see, we are moving at pace, but we're not taking shortcuts. I am very confident that we will turn on Coty and increase its growth potential. We will set up Coty on strong fundamentals with solid portfolio of brands, categories and markets, a competitive cost structure, deep beauty expertise and a diverse and engaging culture, so that our business partner, shareholders and associates can enjoy many years of lasting success. This is our agenda. And we are all committed to it.","I would now let Pierre-Andre walk you through the divisional performance and financial of fiscal '19 and our fiscal '20 outlook and then together, we will take your questions.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Thank you, Pierre and good morning, everyone.","To start with, I am on Slide number 5. The fourth quarter, and as a result full year, came very much in line with our expectations. Revenues at minus 4% for the quarter were consistent with the full-year trend and mainly from higher comps.","Specifically, for the quarter, we had some deloading in Professional, but which were offset by another strong performance in Luxury, while at the same time Consumer on its side remained weak.","The gross margin was up in Q4 and I think that's very important because it shows that the business is overall resilient and healthy when you take away the supply chain issues. So gross margin up was extremely important.","Adding to these gross margin here for the fourth quarter, active cost cutting and being selective - continuing to be selective on the A&CP, essentially on the non-working media, helped operating margin, being up by a strong 220 basis points for the quarter.","I'll come back later on the Group earnings, and I will now turn to the divisions. I'll start with Luxury, which trends remain strong and here you have some example of the activities during the quarter. We renewed two licenses, Marc Jacobs and Lacoste, reflecting the confidence of these two houses in Coty as a partner. The average license residual life of our total portfolio is eight years and we are proud to be considered as a top quality operator by many of our partners.","Gucci was strong once again after Alchemist Garden, which is now in the top 10 of ultra-luxury in key markets, the launch of lipstick had a very strong start, as mentioned by Pierre, particularly in Asia. Burberry had a very good first full year within Coty, with strong sales uplift.","The launch of Boss Bottled Infinite, which you see at the top of the screen was successful, reinforcing its status as top 5 icon franchise in the male luxury fragrance. And last, as we turn to fiscal '20, we are making two exciting launches now with Gucci Memoire and Bottega Veneta Illusione coming.","Slide 7, all this contributed to another strong quarter for Luxury, with mid single-digit growth. By geographies, we saw through Travel Retail and ALMEA to emerging markets, grew particularly strong and the category on the other hand continued growing in U.S. I think that's important to have in mind when you read - everything you read about the U.S., the fragrance category is going up.","Margins were strongly up helped by operating leverage on the one hand, but also by cost reduction and altogether Luxury being 40% of Coty's, keeps being a strong and consistent growth and profit engine for the Group and it's very important for us, of course.","Turning to Consumer Beauty, it remains weak, we see that. However, we had several initiatives which were taken during the quarter. In the U.K., the Rimmel Wonder'luxe mascara helped the brand gain share. You see that on the left of the screen. Still in the U.K., Clairol Natural Instincts was a successful launch and in the U.S., Sally Hansen continued bringing innovation to the market. You have example here showing significantly for the brand better resilience in the portfolio than some other brands.","Nonetheless, the persistent loss of shelf space in the U.S. and in Europe continued dragging on sales, which were down 11%, in line with the year. Brazil was satisfaction again, with a good performance and price increases taken ahead of fiscal '20. And in the case of Consumer Beauty, of course, meaningful cost saving and A&CP reduction, mostly in non-working media helped delivering on profit, with a 10.4% margin in Q4, which is not bad.","We are not turning to fiscal '20, with steady plans across the divisions, including, as Pierre mentioned, meaningful working media investments. We expect to see some positive signals in this first half of fiscal '20 in terms of shares first, where we do not expect material incremental losses anymore, and in some cases, we see some upward potential.","And in terms of consumer as well with the effect of improved execution and increased visibility and we expect these positives to gradually improve Consumer Beauty top line trends.","I'm turning to Professional, the division was impacted by destocking, but the underlying trends remain positive. ghd continues being a strong growth engine with double-digit growth and successful innovations. Here you have the Glide hotbrush, credit [indiscernible] continued to do well. And last, a complete and modern range for men was launched under the brand SEB MAN segment with success and Pierre mentioned just a few minutes ago, the launch of weDo\/ as well.","Despite these positive trends, 2019 was not a good year from the revenue standpoint. The deloading in the U.S. coming after a major supply chain disruptions in H1, margins progressed though, signing again the strength of the division, being up by 70 - the gross margin - sorry being up by 70 bps for the year and the operating income margin, adjusted operating income margin being up 190 bps to now 12%.","And so beyond the temporary difficulties, Professional is definitely an asset for Coty, with the number one brand in salon color with Wella, with better with a strong presence within the salons precisely, and two brands which we believe have high potential, ghd, I mentioned already, and OPI, and we expect this strength to deliver profitable growth for us.","Turning to Slide 12, at the time - and you have seen the separate release, at the time, we are passing with Younique. And if you look at the work, which has been accomplished by Coty in the past few years, the percentage of A&CP being digital is now close to that of our peers, and maybe more significant as evidenced from this slide is the growth of our e-commerce business and the proportion of our revenues it now represents; 10% in Luxury, which is ahead of the fragrance category range, low-teens in Professional where we have been progressing in particular with the relationship with the salons, and Consumer is catching up rapidly, in particular, in the U.S. and in Asia. And as we move forward, we'll reorganize to better leverage our resources in the divisional teams as well as our IT teams to continue progressing fast moving area.","And now coming back to the results and profits, which has been the focus of the year, so starting with the fourth quarter. The gross margin in this quarter was strongly up in Luxury, more than offsetting the decline mainly observed in Consumer. The adjusted operating income was strongly up at 12.2% for an EPS which was up $0.02 at $0.16.","If I turn to the year, 2019 was obviously impacted by supply chain issues, which pushed the gross margin down by 40 basis points. As mentioned several times, a big work of fixed reduction - of fixed cost reduction and selectively reducing the A&CP, primarily non-working media, helped delivering an adjusted operating income at $990 million at constant FX, which is very much in the range of $950 million to $1 billion, which we had indicated in February, so we delivered this commitment.","Op margin was up, as a result, to 11%, the operating margin adjusted. Annual EPS was broadly stable, if you take into account the 4% negative impact from the evolution of the currency.","The free cash flow, Page 15, was obviously a key priority for the year as we aimed at deleveraging our balance sheet. After a negative start of the year on supply chain issues, we delivered for the entire fiscal '19, $200 million of free cash flow against negative $30 million last year. So that's the beginning of a steady improvement.","The dividend amounted to $346 million, out of which $63 for the last quarter, which reflected 68% participation through the DRIP and 34%, therefore, of the dividend paid in shares. On an annualized basis, it will - this will mean a $250 million of cash dividend payment, and therefore, after the stabilization of the debt in 2019 at $7.4 billion, we now expect in 2020 to start deleveraging and move towards the 4 times leverage by 2023.","Before I conclude, a few comments on developments which took place during the quarter. First and foremost, we unveiled our Turnaround Plan on July 1. This was very important internally as it sets a roadmap of actions to restore the competitiveness of our Company and it sets the business and financial frame for our actions and we are now in the process of implementing it as Pierre has told you.","At the same time, we also made public that we had agreed with our banks an amendment to our credit agreements with a view to get the necessary flexibility to the implementation of our Turnaround Plan. This is now in place. This morning, we announced that we're exiting Younique and selling our stake to the other existing shareholders. This is a clear signal of focus.","We have, as said earlier, gained a lot of digital knowledge during our years of cooperation, but both Younique and we are convinced that the best way forward is to focus on our respective businesses, which are very different. In our case, we will therefore focus on creating value with our Luxury, Consumer and Professional Beauty business.","Last, and as anticipated, early July, we took an additional impairment of $2.9 billion in Q4 for a total for the year of $3.9 billion. This reflects our new Turnaround Plan as well as the revised expectations we had for Younique.","I'm now going to turn to fiscal '20, the new year, and basically confirm our expectations of solid dynamic for this year. After a year of decline of our net revenues, we expect trends to improve and net revenues to be stable to slightly down year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. These will be helped for a part by increased A&CP investments.","Taking into account such investments, we expect our adjusted operating income to grow 5% to 10% year-on-year at constant scope and currency. Such growth will come across the second, third and fourth quarters, while Q1 will be moderately down as we ignite our programs with strong A&CP investments. We expect the growth of our adjusted operating income to fuel a mid single-digit growth of our adjusted EPS. And last, we expect to capitalize on our 2019 progresses and keep improving our free cash flow in this fiscal '20 year.","I will conclude in saying that the many activities I think everyone at Coty make us both energized and optimistic at the outset of this new year, and among these, I wanted to show on this slide the new campaign for Calvin Klein, which is kicking off exactly today and is shown therefore on this page.","Thank you for your attention and we both Pierre and I am going to take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","So, I guess my first question was around, you talked about positive retailer response to your plans in the U.S. So I wanted to get more color on that. Are you seeing an improvement in sell-through trends at this point? How should we externally assess your performance in the U.S. in the near term?","Pierre Laubies","The conversation has been, roughly, I mean in general very positive, because as I said earlier, what we presented made common sense and was focused on making our key SKUs more available and improving their operational performance, as well as what was a big driver of the conversation was our desire to return to high advertising investments behind our core brands. And I would say that basically speaking, the main - the number one take-out is that we anticipate a moderation of shelf space reduction going forward.","And of course, we have not completed all this conversation, but we do believe that this outcome of this conversation suggests a moderation in shelf space reduction in the second part of 2020, whilst of course, the first part of 2020 will reflect the previous decision, which has been made in the spring of 2019.","Faiza Alwy","And then just a quick follow-up, just in light of your divestment of the Younique stake and your comments around focus. I was just curious how you're thinking about the rest of the portfolio? Are there other brands or businesses that you think may not - may not fit with your go-forward strategy?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Nothing to comment at this stage, I mean we are really - we are really - Younique was a bit of a specific case as being a multi-level marketing business is extremely different from the rest of the business we have, so the rest of our brands are essentially either very, very much in line with our Luxury strategy, Consumer strategy, Professional strategy and therefore we have nothing to add on that, so we're just focusing on turning around the entire portfolio.","Pierre Laubies","I'd like to come back to your earlier question, Faiza, basically speaking, our fiscal year guidance reflects clearly improving trend in Consumer Beauty. So I'm not going to say that you're going to see growth from Consumer Beauty, but you are going to see a reduction of the decline, all right? And I think it is really important that we term these and I think we will, I really have no doubt about that.","And when we talk about focus, as I said earlier in previous call, our focus is investing mostly at scale behind our key brand. We have identified these 12 brands, which represent a significant proportion of our portfolio, and we will concentrate our working media effort and behind these lines.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC.","Nik Modi","So just - I just wanted to clarify, when the guidance was given in the press release, you said at the current scope of the portfolio. I just want to - does that include Younique or not? I just wanted to make sure I understood exactly because that announcement came out after - I saw it after the press release was released. That's the first question and then the real --","Pierre Laubies","That's an easy one.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Well, definitely. I'm going to clean that very rapidly and then you move to the second one.","Pierre Laubies","Yes.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","The Younique operating income for last year was 16 - one six - $16 million, and therefore, when we say constant scope, it is ex-these $16 million operating income.","Nik Modi","Great, thank you for that clarification. And then I guess the bigger question is one of the main things you discussed when you met with the investment community was the SKU rationalization program that you were planning to implement and as we get to the September shelf resets and you're having these discussions, just maybe you can give us some color and texture on how those discussions are going around that particular initiatives, and do you still feel good about not losing space and sales as a result?","Pierre Laubies","Yes, we do feel good about that. And our customers do feel good about that. I think they see it - they see it as really something which will help the shelf productivity, and actually, I think the conversation - it will help the conversion on shelf stage because it will improve our velocity. So, and we do, we have factual data - we still must say that actually when we do it - when we take out lower trading SKUs, more volume gets concentrated to the highest rotating one.","So actually improves the shelf productivity and also again this is a process, which will be gradual, right? This is not a process that we are going to execute widely and in a very aggressive manner. This takes time, we need to do our - time again we need to optimize them, we need to implement them, and it is continue - it will be a gradual process over the next, I would say two years easily and no, I'm not worried therefore the shelf space losses out of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Christina Brathwaite","This is Christina Brathwaite on for Andrea. Thanks for taking my question. I guess - to put a finer point on the Consumer Beauty shelf space question, previous management kind of alluded to the acquired brands were the reason the shelf space declines were occurring with the acquired brands had more shelf space and maybe their market share imply they should have. So I was just wondering if you think at this point, the market, the shelf space is in line with the market share that you're seeing?","Pierre Laubies","Yes, I think we are, - where we ought to be. I think we need to earn our right to increase shelf space going forward and that will be related to velocity and I do honestly believe that with the decision that we are making to focus advertising behind these 12 brands to maximize the distribution of all high rotating SKU or we just did.","We will again earn our right to increase shelf space. I think actually - and again, as I said earlier, I think the feedback from our customers, at least for the 50% of the business that we have still too is positive. We will just do that in the likes of all our markets, but I feel, again, as I said, confident on the matter.","Christina Brathwaite","And then I guess in regards to the free cash flow expectations for this year, particularly related to the working capital side of the business, it looks like receivables were down more than 20% again in 4Q. So I just wanted to get an understanding of what the drivers are there, if that should continue through the first half of this year and how you're thinking about working capital?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","So it's kind of the - the evolution of receivable was driven by two different initiatives. One is the use of factoring program we started as soon as Q3. And the other one is reduction of the overdues, we have been investing significant amount of time to reduce the overdues, which had been high at the beginning of '19. Obviously, the factoring is a program we use and we'll keep using, but there would be no big extension of that.","The main factor is going to be the reduction of the overdue, which we are going to continue, and the focus going forward is going to be very much on the reduction of the inventory. We believe we have significant potential of reduction of inventories through better managing the inefficiencies of our supply chain, which is therefore not only the potential of course for different growth, also potential of freeing up of cash and that's going to be the next - our next target.","For 2020 specifically, I would expect some progress, but not major ones given the fact that's part of what we are doing in 2019 is just going to be reproduced, but not extended and inventories will take a bit of time and I expect we are going to renew significant progress with the inventories starting from the following year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I wanted to know first if we could talk a little bit about price mix in Consumer Beauty. I guess first what it sort of looked like this quarter and then we think about the full year, why we should be expecting it to turn positive in fiscal '20? Thanks.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","On price - sorry, can you repeat the last part of your question?","Lauren Lieberman","Yes, it was done on price mix in Consumer Beauty both performance in the quarter and fiscal '19 and then why we should be expecting it to turn positive in '20 because I would assume the planned reduction in promotions is a great aspiration but timeline to be able to really put that through is what I want to be able to understand a little bit better.","Pierre Laubies","Yes, I think that the reduction in promotion is happening now as we speak in many markets. Of course, some markets are longer than to execute, right? I think in the price mix, so you want to be - there are some drivers of the third category, which I think probably influenced by the mix of geographies. So I think that had still been underway, I think in - in the quarter 4, we had some, some effect due to the Brazil wave into the portfolio of the quarter four third party, the driver this mix effect. We do have a substantial reduction of promotion already happening in some of our key markets.","And as a consequence, we do see that our base business velocity is up too, we do - we have data which verifies and proves that the Consumer Beauty business is relatively price inelastic. And as a consequence, we see that as a clear opportunity to take pricing with our jeopardizing volume and we have been shy over the years to do that whilst our competition have not and have by doing so, being able to generate margin to invest, which we were not able to do at the same time.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","If I can add to that, Lauren, so it's clear that's part of the focus of the turnaround plan is on the trade conditions, resuming level of dialog with the trade, which is more positive and therefore improving dues and being less under pressure as we have been and part of that is about the loss of shelf space, which we expect now is largely behind us.","And part of that, you've got the conditions simply the promotions, the fact that we are increasing meaningfully delivered A&CP is going to be one factor to support the brands and therefore to avoid that into use so much to promotions and the mix is simply something we are starting, as well as part of the start of year OpEx program, better selecting the SKUs, we want to push on the shelf because they have higher attrition, but also because they have better margins.","So all that is going to our churn. The question is the pace and with respect to the pace, we've given an overall indication for full year 2020, which is essentially our guidance, which says that we expect the growth of Coty overall to be stable to exceeds down in throughout the year. So that's the pace we expect of course, consumer beauty is going to be a major contributor to that. But we need to keep flexibility in the way it delivers and to be able to adjust our actions to make it happen. We\u2019re very confident in this happening. We just need to be extremely good and flexible at managing the timing. Now what we are seeing so far is positive.","Lauren Lieberman","I guess my follow-up would be, what you\u2019re seeing, where you are already starting to adjust promotional levels. And where you are - what you are seeing the competition do, is that commensurate kind of reduction and promotional activity. How is that piece coming together and what are your expectations there?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","I think honestly speaking while deploying our strategies and of course, if we have been historically over promoting. So I think in my view, we are going to join the pack of the market, the average of the market and again as I said, we have made a decision to be less dependent on promotion and more dependent upon advertising, more dependent upon brand building and I would say that we will be reducing our percentage of business on deals and in a reasonable manner and I expect we'll be in line with the rest of the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante of Evercore ISI.","Javier Escalante","My question has to do with your target for 2020. You mentioned that there is going to be a moderate improvement, in fiscal 2019 you have a one-time benefit from the receivables factory. And then my understanding was that you will be taking cash restructuring charges. So I would like to know whether this target includes are above and beyond the impact of these cash restructuring charges broadly in line in July about $600 million in cash charges. Could you give us a sense of how much are going to be in 2020? What type of activities are involved? And why you see that the organization that just has been put together seems to be so or will be that needs to be changed again? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Well, that's, that's perfect question. So I got the numbers. Yes, it does, the improvements we are talking about is inclusive of seeing, including the restructuring charges to remind you, we had fairly big amount of restructuring charges anyway in 2019 and will be improving from that level, we expect next year to be in the region of $300 million between the completion of the previous plan and the beginning of the new one mainly the activation of the change of organization.","On the change of organization, I think down to there is one - there is one manufacturer as we have commented during the turnaround plan, we want to be adjusting our structure to our size, our size, our structure was designed for a size we\u2019re true that have been growing significantly, it has. Today we have two heavy structure in the market, this is the factor of cost and this is a factor of complexity, this is slowing down the pace of decision and this is not helpful.","This is again creating complexity as well in supply chain. So we feel extremely important, it's we implemented turnaround plan to have a simpler structure in the markets. And at the same time, we want to make sure that the connection between the markets and the management teams altogether is fluid and we need as well to simplify the level of above the market - above the market through organization.","So that's driving the change of organization, which is by the way going to make stronger the marketing functions because we know our marketing units Luxury and Consumer Beauty which are dedicated and we'll be working on the brands and we will have on the other hand, geographical execution teams one for America, Asia-Pacific and the other one in the Europe and Middle East and Africa.","And we think that's going to help implementing the turnaround much faster and much more efficiently. So to us that was extremely important.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","The Luxury business, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that like 80% on fragrances or so, I know it's got some skincare and philosophy. But I think it's mostly fragrances. And in that context, I'm surprised at the margin being so strong there, it's higher than most of the other peers that we know of in Luxury fragrance. And so I guess the question is, do you think it's sustainable or do you think there is actually improvement from the sort of 15% type operating margin level for that division specifically?","Pierre Laubies","So yes, we think there is potential for improvement. And in fact, we think the OpEx program, while it mainly applies to Consumer Beauty also is going to generate some improvement in Luxury and therefore, we expect the margin of Luxury to be growing up to margin level for that which we think in fact higher than where we are today. Just one word about OpEx because I usually refer assuming everybody knows OpEx is the program aiming at reviewing in details the level of execution of pricing, positioning of the product range in each of our brands and countries.","So it will apply to Luxury as well now. One point, while we expect improvement of the margins over time, we have to be clear as well that the step-up we have had this year is not going to be referred. We've had a specific major focus on profitability this year throughout Coty including Luxury, it's been producing good sustainable performance. But we won't have the same step-up here.","Wendy Nicholson","Fair enough. Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question is just on Younique. Can you give us a sense - I know it's been a challenge for a while now. But if I look at the overall company like-for-like sales last year of down 3.5. Can you tell us what that would have been on excluding Younique for the whole year just so on a kind of pro forma basis, we can get a sense for how much of that drag down your numbers?","Pierre Laubies","Improvements being slightly better kind of - well, I mean getting to give you a number but probably around 60 bps.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steph Wissink of Jefferies.","Stephanie Wissink","I have a follow-up question on some prior questions, just regarding the Consumer Beauty division. I think it was two years ago, actually on this call very similar sentiments from management regarding some of your initiatives around marketing and marketing activation. So I'm curious about how much flexibility you have to react, if the consumer pull through doesn't translate, is there any flexibility in those investments around shelf use merchandising, marketing, and that would give you some latitude if the consumer pull through doesn't occur?","Pierre Laubies","So the answer from the finance guy is yes, there is flexibility. We have seen flexibility just to remind that going of our obsession to have the ability to deliver and therefore we didn't give context, we are building flexibility and we are at the same time watching week after week, what is happening on Consumer Beauty in key markets. And I was yesterday with the American market, where yesterday with the American markets and we're looking at that, we have plans.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","That\u2019s absolutely, I mean we have a clear intent. We know what works, but we don't always manage the timing of things. But I think strategically we know where we want to head and we report always to target and we want to rebalance our non-working media with our working media.","So the way to create flexibility is also to go through the line of the least positive agenda, least positive element of our P&L from a media standpoint, we clearly want to make sure that we generate the money that we want to continue to build our brand and but even on that one, we have good flexibility too, but yes I really want to make sure that we have the right balance of working media and non-working media in this company, we have not been there. We are progressing and we still have margin to progress on this subject.","Stephanie Wissink","Second follow-up on Wendy\u2019s prior question on the Luxury Beauty division. I'm wondering if you can walk through the same analysis for us on the Pro and the consumer business. And what I'm trying to do a bridge that 14% to 16% target relative to this 12% blended margin today. What does the consumer beauty business need to deliver and the Pro business need to deliver on a segment operating margin basis for you to achieve those targets?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","I mean the - we don't expect the same level of margin from Consumer Beauty as we expect from the others down the road. We assume it's going to be more in the 10ish percentage, when we are targeting mid to high teens from the other businesses. But the fundamental element of the evolution are going to be the same, i.e. gross margin uplift through the many elements we've been commenting including the investment in S&P including the simplification of the range, including the reduction of cost, including the lower promos and increased investments.","Including I think very surplus on what exact product we want to push well as in the fixed cost, which is going to be the same throughout the Group and probably higher in the case of Consumer Beauty because we had higher years of complexity than in the rest of the businesses. And we just have lower starting point and therefore the expectations cannot be as high, unless we find a way to accelerate which is - as well as something we're looking, at.","Pierre Laubies","Yes, and I think the way to contribute to strategically rebalance continue to strengthen the profitability of the Consumer Beauty business such as you need to focus on the product lines - they have scale, they have high margin. And they have clear distinctive assets, ability to grow, ability to respond to investment and I think that's the way we are going to change the trajectory of the financials of the Consumer Beauty business by changing its mix.","To our product brands, namely in that case, Max Factor, Rimmel [indiscernible] in Germany, CoverGirl in the U.S. Clairol. These are very, very nice brands, which have a lot of potential, huge assets and huge equity and by doing that and investing behind them will be shift the mix of our portfolio and it also our highest margin items.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper into the A&CP specifically for fiscal 2020 and talk about the relative change that you see across either the three divisions and geographies. And then just in terms of the margins they have obviously been pretty volatile in fiscal 2019 gross margin you had two quarters with big declines, two quarters with slight improvement also a lot of volatility in SG&A as well. So could you just talk about relative volatility in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yes on A&CP, we definitely aim at stepping up our level and start closing the gap we have with competition and including [indiscernible] we can do that, we are definitely on that path. We started as soon as Q1 having in mind that Q1 and that's true, we\u2019re pretty low level and therefore the step up is going to be important. And then we expect the A&CP over net revenues to be gradually growing throughout the year between Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. So the step up is going to be bigger in Q1 with the level so we step up to a level, which then is going to be the base for a gradual increase throughout - for the year.","And as evidenced or include in one of the previous questions, we obviously keep flexibility in the way we - allocate that and in the way we use that it's very important as you can imagine. With respect to gross margin that's a bit of the same. We have four reasons which belong to the specific of the first quarter lower comps feature will be up against this lower comps and then will gradually accelerate throughout the year as we are deploying the OpEx program. So the topline improvement as well as we are generating some improvement on the, supply chain cost reduction.","So from Q1, Q2 will be higher and we expect altogether improvement throughout the year but Q1 is going to be an important part and it shows gross margin improvement actually first but it shows as well a very, very meaningful step-up in terms of A&CP. Hence what I said about the fact that the increase of the operating income with this Q2 of the other three quarters of the year. And then we'll see things progressing as we move into the rest of the quarters.","Pierre Laubies","And again Olivia, the A&CP increase is completely focused on the working media. So the increase is absolutely disproportionate on working media - on the total A&CP budget.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky","I wanted to get back to Consumer Beauty. So there was a pretty material slowdown in like-for-like sales growth in Q4 when compared to the underlying growth in Q3. So I was hoping you could walk through - the drivers of the sequential slowdown that you saw in Q4. And I think it would be helpful if you could talk through how much of that slowdown was driven by unique and how much was from the core business?","Pierre Laubies","Yes, we won't give you the breakdown sorry for that, but Younique indeed was an element of difference. The second element of difference and we knew that we had so we had flagged it as soon as Q3 comes from the fact that we had high comps. The sale that you're has been very aggressive ahead of the changes in supply chain, which took place afterward. And therefore, we had a high cost in Q4 unlike what we had in Q3. So on our side, to be frank, we are not surprised nor afraid, but we have seen on Consumer Beauty has been pretty much what we expected.","And overall, I am pretty pleased by the fact that the only non-fully [indiscernible] element which was the reduction of inventories in Professional Beauty has been offset by once again by Luxury. We don't talk much about Luxury the performance once again has been very strong, it\u2019s because every processor and it certainly very strong really even stronger than we expected even a quarter before the end of the year. So on outside no negative surprise and on the contrary some positive, again a good performance of business.","Joe Lachky","Yes and I guess my follow-up would be on Luxury because it was very strong in Q4, I was hoping you could discuss what's driving the momentum there and if you think you can sustain that growth in the fiscal 2020. And then along those lines you actually relaunched Gucci lipstick in the quarter. So I was hoping you could provide an update on the rollout of Gucci make-up and how you see that proceeding? Thanks.","Pierre Laubies","Well, good Gucci make-up is a great example - I use it in my introductory remark. For me Gucci make-up is a great example of the type of innovation strategy that we need to build at Coty whatever is the channel to realize with you or whatever in the category. At the end of the day Gucci was well identified by the team as a brand which has capacity to expand beyond just fragrances.","And hence the launch of Gucci lipstick and hence decided we believe we can see it, we see it as a very, very successful, as a very successful launch. We will continue to expand in 2020 this franchise or this innovation. And again as I said earlier, we will do more of it, we do more of it in Luxury, but we will do more in professional and we will do more in Consumer Beauty. We want innovation, which has the ability to drive the penetration of our brand and expanding the footprint.","Our brand has the right to travel to new market to other consumer segments, then just the one they have been born in. And in that respect that will be the focus behind which we will be to our innovation pipeline.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yes and maybe to continue to answer the first part - of your second part of your question. Luxury is - it's a portfolio, which has been built year after year. We have been building confidence and trust with the fashion houses. We have pretty sizable business with them, we are working well with them in a very coordinated manner leveraging both their confidence and our confidence, which are complementary and that is giving very strong performance as in the case of Gucci.","As in the case of Burberry we got rid of [indiscernible] year has been very strong being the case of Hugo Boss, which is the number four, I believe icon fragrance in the male business but I thought. So, and this is reflected as well again, I'm sorry to repeat that but it\u2019s important the fact that these licensees are long-term, that is free of partnerships and that they are very solid and delivering.","So it's basically a successful win-win with the houses resulting from consistent investment. And we don't believe by the way that we should not be able to do the same in the other divisions, and in particular in Consumer Beauty.","But we have to target for Consumer Beauty is optimizing finding the solution and then being consistent, consistence delivering innovation, adjusting to the trend of the market, of course, but being consistent in the way we will deal brands. And this is very, very much the spirit of this management team. This is what Pierre is bringing us the level of detail, the very good execution level, but at the same time, consistency in our marketing strategies.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","You mentioned in your prepared remarks a little bit about emphasizing more digital spending maybe at the expense of traditional spending or those weren't exactly your words. Certainly there's been talk of rationalizing spending overall particularly in U.S. Consumer Beauty. I'm wondering could you tell us a little bit more about your process of figuring out where you're getting return and where you're not.","Because it strikes me that, as you reduce spending, we don't know what return, it's hard to tell exactly what return is that increase level of spending had in the U.S. and it's possible that results could have been even worse without it. So just trying to understand that return analysis process, particularly around activation spending and your consumer spending more broadly in the U.S?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Actually, Jonathan our strategy is really to make sure that our mental availability is very consistent all year around and saying that the channels that we have introduced at Coty with this new management team, is a change from a best strategy to three strategy. And we are, we want to be on air all the time, why because of our consumers need to be reminded permanently listen for awhile. Our number one, so we have a series of battery of tests which make sure that our advertising works.","I mean that the consumer will respond to it and pre-advertising post advertising to, but the fundamental thing I would say that we are looking for is the ability of our advertising to drive one metrics, which is quite fundamental for us salience, salience in English I think is item, i.e. the degree of distinctiveness of the brand how the brand becomes top of mind brand, how the brand becomes the brand that consumers never forget and that's the fundamental measure of course of our performance over time.","And this is why we believe that actually yes advertising in the short-term gives you an effect, but what matters most is consistency and presence on all year around. For that our mix of media shift by markets, because what we seek for is reach and depending the market you do operate typically in Anglo section market in the U.S. or U.K. or even Australia you would have a high proportion of digital versus mainstream media, whilst in other market like traditional European market, namely South European market or Germany or even some emerging market more place in emerging market, should be there with different balance because then in that case you reach would be better and more assessable through traditional media.","So I think I answered your question, but fundamentally we drive two things we drive presence we drive salience on one side and we drive the level of coverage of our consumers over time and our presence on them consistently. And the consistency of our advertising I mean our brands have distinctive assets and we want to make sure activity time we'll have a movie or every time we have an ad, it just basically speaking - reminds the consumer of the distinctive asset of the brand. We will take the last question.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Two questions, one just a clarification so the guidance for fiscal 2020 for both net revenue like-for-like stable to slightly lower and 5% to 10% adjusted operating income, is that excluding Younique as if you don't own it. And then just more of a longer-term question so China you called it out a couple of times in the press release obviously, we've seen pretty significant growth out of that market from other beauty peers.","Maybe give a bit of color on where you are today in terms of what Coty\u2019s is in the market, percent of sales expectations on a longer-term basis and kind of what you need to do to see it become more material over time? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","So on the first question, I think I'm very clear for the operating income and for the net revenues that's on the same, I mean that's on a like-for-like basis as well stable to likely down year-on-year. Pierre you want to answer on China?","Pierre Laubies","On China, we clearly have a good business in Luxury and we have a good business in Professional Beauty. So that's great example of the strength of our strategic position in - both the segment. I think we are definitely lagging behind in Consumer Beauty. And what we need to do well Mark, I'll be clearer because I'm going there on the 23th of September. And we are going to spend some time with the team in China to understand what is exactly or what is exactly our opportunity and position. But yet we have a double-digit growth in this market so we are doing well.","And but we can do better and I'm convinced, I have a bit of an intuition, but I would like to verify that intuition, when I am in the field. And but broadly speaking, it is one of the mission critical market I want to reassure you on that. We are going to put a very, very decisive effort in making sure that we change - we don't change - the trajectory of our business, but we change the scale of our business in China. And I know there are a couple of those are emerging market like this one that we must be present if we want to or as we want to have a strong global beauty business.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","So we\u2019ll have a high level of dedication, somehow I know it's a bit strange to comment, but the fact that it only represents today less than 5% of our net revenues is both a liability versus competition or a disadvantage versus competition. But it\u2019s also an advantage because we clearly have amounted stake or risk which are lower and more importantly, we have a lot of potential. So now the question is how do we address this potential, we believe the current organization the portfolio we have of course many, many opportunities and that would be for us to push it.","But I think we can grow China in a very, very meaningful manner, given where we stand as a starting point. And given the strength of the small I mean, of the strength of the business and positions we have which are not enough in terms of numbers and size, but which are real.","Pierre Laubies","And thinking about delivering the organization, China is one of the market which will report directly to the Executive Committee.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Okay, gentlemen and ladies. Thank you very much for your attention. I just would like to say that we are both very excited starting this year 2020. There are many things going on and now we\u2019ll go back to business to put into practice this plan and to basically make it real. So thank you and see you on the road.

This morning, we will take you through a summary of today's announcement and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions.","Q2 was a solid quarter and a very good first step in the right direction as we started executing our strategy as outlined last quarter of investing in and fueling growth of our power brands and driving strong profit growth behind efficiency programs.","Our power brands accounted for approximately 70% of our net revenues, continue to grow like-for-like, albeit modestly both in the quarter and the first half.","We recorded particular good growth in the first half on Rimmel, OPI, Sally Hansen, Chloe, and Philosophy. Thanks to new product launches like Rimmel, Wonderful Mascara, Sally Hansen Miracle Gel, and Chloe Love Story.","Importantly, Q2 illustrated that we're now well on our way to build the better business. We have started to invest more in our power brands while cutting, non strategic spending in the advertising and promotion budget on items like copyrights and usage fees, samples and testers, as well as TV and print production costs.","This modestly reduced our overall A&P spend on our constant rate basis in the quarter. Our actual rate to drop clearly was much bigger due to FX.","To drop in A&P combined with lower fixed cost and cost to goods savings enabled us to increase Q2 operating profits by 12% at constant and 10% at actual rates.","As a result, the Q1 operating profit decline versus the prior year has been fully compensated like I said bringing first half operating profits inline with prior year.","Adjusted EPS at actual rates grew 61% in the quarter and 30% in the half, aided mostly by a lower tax rate but also by a lower share account as we resumed our share buyback program.","Moving to the remainder of full year 2015, we are optimistic about what our strategy can do for Coty's and we remain committed to steadily returning Coty's profitable growth.","Finally our announced offer to acquire Blue Rock Cosmetics from CHANEL is - and we expect the deal to close shortly pending the approval from the relevant authorities.","I\u2019ll now hand over the call to Patrice, who will provide a few comments on the financials and the progress of the global efficiency plan.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","Thank you, Bart. And good morning, everyone. I will comment on the overall P&L, and our overall financial position. First, the P&L.","Total net revenues were flat like-for-like in the second quarter. Our focus on cost of goods reduction supported by our supply chain program enabled the Q2 adjusted gross margin to increase 80 basis point to 59.5%.","Our year-to-date adjusted gross margin was up 30 basis point to 59.6%. The company\u2019s contracts also show improvement as we saw solid reduction in our fixed cost. And as Bart discussed, the reduction in A&P spending the quarter, reflected the focus on efficiencies in nonworking media even as investment behind our power brand increased.","We are very confidence in the progress of our global efficiency plan as the action we have taken to-date will bring us more than halfway towards our savings goal of $200 million.","And as we continue to dig deeper in our business, we are confident that they are more opportunities to come. As a result of these factors, we are happy to see our adjusted operating conclude 10% in the quarter, with the margin expanding 200 basis points to 15.9% versus 13.9% in the prior period.","It's worth nothing that we saw margin improvement in each of our segments with fragrance up as strong 270 basis point to 21%, color cosmetic up 170 basis point to 11.8% and Skin & Body Care up 40 basis point to 6.6%.","Moving down the P&L, thanks to a foreign tax settlement in the U.K., our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 5.1%. This settlement coupled with this ongoing benefits should result in adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 60% in fiscal 2015.","Looking beyond fiscal 2015, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 25% with potential for viability depending on the breakdown of profit by region.","All these encouraging results are the right steps towards building a better business and beginning a strong leader in the global beauty industry over time.","We also resumed our share buyback program as we repurchased 7.6 million shares in the open market during Q2 for $149 million.","We have continued our repurchasing activity in the current quarter and fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased approximately 13 million shares for approximately $250 million. At this point, we had 15 million remaining under the current authorization and we intent to continue to be opportunistic in that front.","The combination of our strong adjusted operating income growth, lower effective tax rate, and active share repurchases drove a very significant 61% growth in our Q2 adjusted EPS to $0.45 and a 30% growth in our first half adjusted EPS to $0.73.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Please stand by for your first question, which comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hi, guys. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more how currency is going to impact the top and the bottom line for the fiscal year? And then maybe if you have any commentary about how you think the category growth rates are trending and what the retailer inventory levels look like especially in the mass channel. Both of those would be really helpful. Thanks.","Kevin Monaco","I'll start with the ethics question. I've shown in our earnings release, [ethnic translation] [ph] negatively impacted our Q2 revenues by 5% and by 2% for the first half. The impact on our profitability was more moderate as our business had natural hedging built-in with a large portion of both our revenues and costs delivered in euros.","The negative impact of ethnic translation on our operating income was 3% in Q2 and 1% for the first half of the year.","Now when you come to the rest of the year assuming rates remain at current levels. We will see negative impact of approximate to be 5% to 6% on both revenues and income for the second half.","Bart Becht","So in terms of the categorical, I can give you picture of where we stand at the moment in terms of the markets, which we read and we are exposed to, we have seen overall growth in the beauty industry of 1%, 1.5% which you know, I would say Skin & Body growing less than that, color growing faster than that and fragrance being more or less in line with that.","In terms of within fragrance, prestige is growing faster than mass. Mass is declining in some markets, not in all, but in some markets.","So if you look at the growth rate that we are exposed to, market growth rate, you can see that, on net revenue growth is somewhat less on a total basis, our power brands clearly growing in line if not faster than the market growth rate, but our overall growth rate is somewhat less, which reflects in part A, in fill and in part reflects that we have given up some ground between growth sales and net revenue growth in terms of discounts and allowances. Does that answer your question?","Bill Schmitz","Yes, it does. I was curious about the inventory levels also at the trade? Especially in the Mass channel and even more specifically in the US.","Bart Becht","Yeah there is clearly, there is continuing efforts to optimize that. Having said that, if I have to compare this to last year or the year before, the impact is less than it was in prior years, but there is still an impact from inventory reduction. I wouldn't say that it\u2019s a hugely material impact on our total Coty numbers","Bill Schmitz","Okay, great. Just a follow-up on that growth to net impact. Is the worst over on that front or do you think it's still going to be fairly heavily promotional going forward?","Bart Becht","Well that clearly depends on the competitive situation going forward, which is hard to predict. So clearly we have efforts in place in order to reduce the gap between grow sales growth and net revenue growth, but you know, it will very much depend on the competitive situation.","Bill Schmitz","Great. Thanks very much guys","Operator","The question comes from Chris Ferrara of Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara","I guess on advertising and consumer promotion. Bart, I think last quarter maybe you indicated that you're looking to improve the returns on that spend and you improved the non-working media portion. Maybe shift some of that into working media. This quarter, you had a big SG&A reduction and you guys said at lower advertising and consumer promo. What drove it down and is this a trend? Like would expect advertising and consumer promotion to continue to trend down year-on-year?","Bart Becht","Yeah we have - if anything we have increased the push in terms of efficiency programs since I took over. Even I would say we probably have substantially intensified that.","I would say within Coty there is substantial room to improve what I will call cutting non-strategic spend and investing in strategic spend. And when I talk about non-strategic spend you have to think about everything the consumer never sees, which is how much money we spent on producing commercials, display materials, copyright fees etc., so which is clearly necessary item, but it is a spend the consumer doesn't see and there is huge room for improvement in this area.","Similarly the fixed cost, there is a number of buckets where there is room for improvement in rationalization. So going forward, you will see our heart in efficiency programs and then a gradual redeployment of some of those savings back in our power brands.","So if you look at the Q2 results, you have seen growth on power brands, you had seen very modest growth, no growth at all on the total company, but you have seen substantial increase in profit growth.","So in terms of going forward, I would be very happy if we have a similar pattern to what we've seen in the second quarter, which means continued growth is what we are targeting for our power brands and continued growth basically in profits from efficiency programs.","Chris Ferrara","Got it. And efficiency in that you could expect that advertising and consumer promotion margin to be lower year-on-year as you move through the rest of the year and into next?","Bart Becht","I think there is room for improvement in terms of the A&P and the SG&A ratio absolutely.","Chris Ferrara","I know Patrice, you said it on the last call too, that you guys have now booked expenses on the efficiency programs that get you about half of the savings. Does that suggest you've actually realized half of the savings or might you not even be at that level yet on savings?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","Yeah it's a good question. So actually what I said is that the actions that we have already put in place would realize half of the savings. So they did not yet materialize in the P&L, but let me come back on that and be a little bit more precise.","So, what we have said is that we have a savings target of $200 million. If you remember this $200 million is split into three buckets, you have first the China business organization for $20 million.","We have the - and we have the remainder amount for the One Coty reorganization. So where we are now, and what you could expect in the fiscal 2015, you should expect the bulk of the China savings to come through the P&L.","You, what I have quoted in the last earnings call is that, $45 million of the $60 million productivity program should come through in fiscal 2015 knowing that $25 million that has been realized in fiscal 2014.","So there is another $20 to come this year P&L. And in terms of One Coty, I think we are progressing very nicely and there is, the bulk of improvement is going to materialize in the second half of the year and you have a very minimal impact in the first half of the year. So you could expect roughly $20 million impact on the cost structure in fiscal 2015","Chris Ferrara","Great. Thanks a lot.","Bart Becht","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for you question. The next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong, Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","First, I was wondering could you just break out the growth from the power brands versus the non-power brands and how do you think about that going forward? Would you expect that the non-power brands continue to be a drag on sales?","Bart Becht","Yeah what we have seen in the first half of the year, we have seen modest to mid-single digit growth on our power brands and clearly the remainder of the business has not grown resulting in the overall picture of a flat business.","Clearly as going forward, we\u2019re looking to further boost the growth of our power brands while overtime we\u2019d expect that the tail brands will decline in terms of importance and in terms of impact on the total growth rates.","So that's what we\u2019re targeting for is to redeploy some of our savings out the efficiency programs into our power brands and we will be targeting to gradually working to increase pull behind our power brands and then we would see a gradual decline of the impact of our tail.","Olivia Tong","Just looking at U.S. mass data, it looks like the women's fragrances area saw a little bit of an uptick in the last four weeks. I know four weeks doesn't make a trend. Is there something specific that's been driving that and can we read into potential actions that you've taken or potential actions that you're planning to take in order to keep that growth rate going?","Bart Becht","I never really look at four week data certainly not in the beauty categories because they can fluctuate dramatically from one four week period to another. So I'm more interested in what is happening on a year-to-date basis.","In the U.S. the fragrance category is showing low but okay-ish growth, like I said somewhere in the range of 1% to 1.5% with prestige fragrances growing at the moment we see fragrances declining.","So clearly, we are doing very well with some of our brands in the fragrance category in particular with Marc Jacobs, and Daisy Dream or with Chloe behind Love Story.","So we have some good initiatives, Calvin Klein Reveal was okay but was more mixed compared to the other two, the other two were definitely successes.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John Faucher","I wanted to ask two questions here. First off, given what you just said about Marc Jacobs and Chloe, just following up on the celebrity weakness. It sounds as though that's not going into the designer segment yet or should we read into some of the weakness on the Calvin Klein launch that maybe at a mass level you're seeing that celebrity piece drag into designer?","And then the second question was about M&A in terms of as you look at this volatility and the continued weakness in some of these categories, do you think that shakes more assets out? Are people we're seeing proctor and look to divest some assets? Are you seeing people get nervous about some of this weakness and with a greater willingness to sell? Thank you.","Bart Becht","Well, as you can imagine, we're not going to comment on the later, since we cannot comment on any M&As. In terms of your first question, you\u2019re definitely right that the mass fragrance part in particular on the celebrity side, in the U.S. is in decline at the moment.","On the other hand, prestige fragrances are showing good growth and we do not see any similar phenomenon like we\u2019ve seen on celebrity fragrances hitting any of the prestige designer fragrances.","John Faucher","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Two questions. First, I just want to be clear, the power brands having grown faster in the first quarter than they did in the second quarter. I assume that's just timing of initiatives and all that I know, but you said that you don't care about really short term results. But nothing in terms of a structural deterioration with any of those brands I just want to be clear on that.","And then the second question is, you called out in the release the travel retail business as being particularly strong. But Estee also reported this morning and they called out that channel as being weaker. So can you comment on travel retail? Whether you think you're gaining share there? Maybe why you're business is more robust than theirs in travel retail specifically? Thanks.","Bart Becht","Yeah I will let Patrice comment on the travel refill numbers in specifically.","Kevin Monaco","Can you repeat the first part of your question one more time, sorry I didn't.","Wendy Nicholson","Just that the power brands seems to have been stronger in the first quarter than they were in the second quarter and I'm trying to understand why that was.","Kevin Monaco","As you all know, this is - particular in the fragrance industry, launches have a huge impact on quarterly results. Clearly in the first quarter, we had the massive launch of Calvin Klein Reveal and we had more of an impact there than we've had in the second quarter. So clearly there is phasing impact between the two.","Would I say basically that I will be concerned about this, at this stage, no, but clearly we watch the quarterly results as well. But I wouldn\u2019t say there was anything in terms of trends because it has much more to do with chasing of initiatives.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","I'm not sure we\u2019re not going to comment on the - on one of our competitive performance. What we can say about the Coty performance is that in the last quarter we grow in Q2 versus the prior period. And I can also emphasize the fact that we had pretty strong result in the Americas and in Asia-Pac offset by some weaknesses I would say in the European region.","Wendy Nicholson","Do you have a sense for your market share and travel retail?","Bart Becht","No. Not yet. It's too early to say.","Wendy Nicholson","Got it. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jason Gere, KeyBanc Capital Market.","Jason Gere","Just two quick questions. One, as we think about the FX that's going to hit you through the year, can you talk about where there are opportunities for pricing over the course of the next six months? And then secondly, going back to tail brands and I understand the spending that you're putting on the power brands, but at what level do you balance between stabilizing the growth and the profitability without the risk of any destocking of some of those tail brands at some of your key customers? Thanks.","Bart Becht","Yeah, let me take the first part. So, in terms of pricing, I don't think, that isn't certainly the first protocol. We have like I said before, a huge amount of improvement potential within Coty in terms of efficiencies. Not just on the cost of goods line but most importantly in the SG&A line. And I think that's where I would look for compensating potential impacts from an FX point of view.","Pricing will be very much dependent on the competitive situation and I do not think that in most categories and countries at the moment there are substantial room to take price increases simply because the exchange rate changed. So, efficiency programs will be our first protocol.","In terms of the tail, we should not forget that well over 70% of our total portfolio is in power brands and to the extend by reallocating our resources into those power branding, we can make a run better and faster, that should be more than compensate the decline in the balance of the portfolio. And quite frankly, a lot of those older brands, the return on investment is simply not very good.","So, I would not put my money there.","Operator","The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I just wanted to talk a little bit actually again about power brands trends because clearly second quarter with weaker than first. It decelerated from mid-single digits to up modestly. And yet with incremental investment behind those businesses and a lot of really solid launch activity and philosophy having had good momentum into the quarter, I had thought Adidas with some launch activity, obviously, Marc Jacobs, Chloe, et cetera. I'm not sure why there wouldn't be any concern around deceleration in power brands with all of this launch activity.","I understand cost savings are tremendous. They're going to help the way along but it does feel like there's something missing on the power brands at this point. I'd love to hear more about plans to address that. Thank you.","Bart Becht","There is clearly internal discussion in the base in terms of the best initiatives and the best investments to be made in power brands. In terms of the deceleration, I think you really very much have to think about phasing of initiatives plus one or two other factors.","One factor clearly is Adidas, China where we shifted from our own business model to handing the business over to Lee Ying Foo which the cost is substantial chunk in terms of revenues simply because we\u2019re working with a different business model.","What I have also mentioned basically the Calvin Klein, the phasing of the initiatives of Reveal. So there is a number of factors.","If you're looking at brands which are doing really outstanding in the portfolio, clearly you need to think about brands I've mentioned before which are Rimmel, Sally Hansen, OPI, Chloe, Marc Jacobs, Philosophy. Those brands are all doing extremely well.","Adidas is largely down because of the change in the China business model. Playboy is down mostly because of the assortment and competitive pressures and Calvin Klein which is our largest brand is mostly - or is less from a growth point of view, in the second quarter, in the first quarter because of phasing of initiatives.","Operator","The next question comes from Connie Maneaty, BMO Capital Market.","Connie Maneaty","Good morning. As you look at the future cost savings opportunities, how do they compare to the size of what it is you're doing now? And should we expect there to be more charges to execute any future plan?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","Thank you for the question. Good question. As I said we still have a lot to do to realize the full extent of the $200 million savings because all the actions till date are using $200 million savings.","However, I think we are progressing very nicely. And we\u2019ll clearly provide an update with the Q3 results if there is any adjustments in program so far.","So as far as your precise question on China, clearly everything has been booked already in terms of the productivity program, the bulk of it has been booked. And in terms of One Coty, the bulk of it has been booked in the sense that the remaining part of the program is mainly to do within direct procurement savings. So what we have done for the time being is the reorganization side of the business.","Now, as Bart eluded to several times, what we need to do is to bring more flexibility to P&L and the more we dig, the more we seize some opportunities in direct procurement, mainly in direct procurement actually.","Connie Maneaty","Thank you. And then a question on the tax rate. How much this year's reduction would you term as permanent and how much is one time in nature?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","Good question. As I said, in the Q2 results, the effective tax rate was 5.1% and this is mainly due to a one-off, due to UK tax settlement.","However what I've mentioned, that beyond 2015, you\u2019re going to get some substantial savings from an effective tax rate because the previous guidance 28%, and the new guidance that we're now giving is 25% plus or minus depending on where we are making profit.","So we have 300 basis point improvement, thanks to all the settlements that we have done. So I think that gives you the answer to your question.","Connie Maneaty","Thank You.","Operator","The next question comes from Steph Wissink of Piper Jaffrey.","Steph Wissink","Just curious about some of the initiatives. Particularly the discounts and promotions you ran during the holiday period in 2014. How are you thinking about anniversaring some of those events or maybe changing some of those in 2015?","And then, just a question more broadly on the lifecycle of new product introductions. I'm curious to your thoughts around the selling window of kind of the peak to trough demand. Are you seeing that narrowing over time as a competitive environment gets a little bit more intense? Or do you find that your demand curves tend to be well established and are following a historic trend? Thank you.","Bart Becht","Yeah. I think, the rate of innovation clearly has dramatically increased over the last couple of years, certainly over the last ten years, pretty much across all the categories that we're in, to increase much beyond but is literally hard to imagine.","Also in terms of peaks and troughs, they have changed and they have tightened over the last couple of years. But there is no like further change in the recent history.","So does it mean we are now stabilized going forward. Time will tell. And I think a question in terms of promotions, there is a slight increase in promotional intensity in our business compared to last year which I already alluded to before as we spend more between growth sales and net revenues.","As a percentage of net revenues in the year-to-date numbers compared to last year and this is exactly another opportunity which I believe we can tackle going forward.","Steph Wissink","Just one follow-up with respect to some of your marketing initiatives. We've been observing some really unique and creative digital marketing strategies. If you could you just give us some insights into what you're learning on the digital front or social front, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Bart Becht","Yeah. I don't want to dig in too much into digital learning because that clearly needs to stay in-house since that's commercially sensitive stock.","But as you can imagine in certain categories which we're in, digital is a fair amount importance. I only have to tell you about like the color category clearly is a usual important category from a digital point of view because consumers start very, very young using this products and clearly the younger the consumer audience is, the higher the consumption is of digital media.","So I would say much beyond that, I really don't want to discuss.","Steph Wissink","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel","Mark Astrachan","Bart, I wanted to sort of get your thoughts about your engagement in the business. Obviously, you've been interim CEO for a while now but you're also I suspect feeling a little bit more with the protracted EU review into the coffee businesses. Sort of wondering how you're sort of dividing and conquering your time today?","And then just more broadly the thoughts on a CEO search and what sort of traits you're looking for whether it's beauty experience and operator to come in and roll up the sleeves and do more on the cost-cutting that you've already done. Somebody that could do both assuming that there's somebody out there like, would be helpful.","Bart Becht","Yeah I think my Coty colleagues probably came and tested this that, I'm spending definitely full time working weeks on their business.","So if you want my time split, it's probably like 80-20 between Coty and the rest of the other business which I'm involved with which is on coffee. Where I'm just the Chairman and I'm not really involved in any executive capacity.","In terms of the CEO, so what are we looking for? So what we\u2019re clearly looking for is somebody who has the leadership skills, who has the strategic vision and who has the operational capabilities, and who has clearly extensive experience in the consumer goods whereas an ideally exposure to some of the categories that we're in.","I would say those are all very obvious, our requirements. In terms of the timing, we are still looking pretty much at the same time is we're looking for somebody to start some time over the summer and that hasn't really changed where more gains, search process than we were the last time we talked.","Mark Astrachan","Great. Thank you and just another question. Given the improving EBITDA do you think there is an opportunity need for to restructure some of the debt covenants to allow more leverage or any sort of thoughts that you could give around potential opportunities would be helpful?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt","Yes. Good question. But I'm not sure that I am going to comment on that one on our debt covenants and on the structural of our financial, so I keep it quite for attendees. But that\u2019s a good question. Thank you for that.","Bart Becht","We'll look forward to update on that. Thank you.","Mark Astrachan","I'm sure you will.","Operator","The next question comes from Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","I have a couple of clarifications if you will. As you basically reduce the support to the non-core brands, 30% of the portfolio shall we expect topline growth to be flat absent an acquisition? That would be my first question.","And my second question is a clarification on Europe. It's not surprised to be weak but as my colleague Wendy mentioned with regards to Estee, they have a very strong growth in Europe. And I wonder if you can comment on how you see category growth in Europe between mass and prestige?","And also if you can give off a sense of how the joint venture with Avon is going in Brazil? Whether the second quarter results for Playboy and Adidas that came out to be down has to do with its slower start in Brazil? Thank you.","Bart Becht","Let's start with your first point. So, our number one objectives at the moment and foremost to dramatically improve the efficiency of the business and to restore profitable on the business.","The second part is a huge part of the savings out of the efficiency programs, is to start growing our business at a higher level. And clearly this is a gradual process, because it's a process of generating savings, then identifying the opportunities where we can invest with a decent ROI and where we cannot is where we put the money on the bottom line.","So, you can have to think about efficiency to generate savings part of it goes to the bottom line, part get reinvested back in the power brands for growth.","So clearly this means that we are targeting further profit growth and that we are targeting a gradual improvement in topline growth momentum.","In terms of your question on Brazil with Avon, that\u2019s been a nice effort. It largely impacted the first quarter probably than the second quarter which is simply a part of the way they run the business because you know this is door-to-door business and it comes and waves.","But I would say overall results are satisfactory. They are pretty much in line with our expectations. Did I answer your question or did I miss something?","Javier Escalante","Thank you, yes. Most of it, the only one has to do with Europe. It's not surprising that it's weak but the question that I have is that both LDMH and Estee Lauder reported better growth. Then the question is whether it's an issue of category growth and if you could comment on master prestige in Europe? If you have any sense of what would be a reasonable growth rate in your view these two separate segments are growing mass versus prestige in Western Europe? Thank you.","Bart Becht","Yeah I am looking less and less of that because the lines between mass and prestige in more and more countries has starting to blur to be honest with you. So I would say, in terms of - before I told you that the overall market growth rate that we\u2019re exposed to was somewhere around 1% to 1.5%.","I would say Europe is some what less than that. Where we are still seeing growth is in Northern Europe and parts of Eastern Europe, some Europe is not a very good story.","In terms of by category, we\u2019re still seeing in similar phenomena as we see in the U.S. where the prestige fragrance is growing but mass is somewhat declining. On the other side, probably the most dynamic part of the business also there is the color category.","So, if you want a exact data we can probably give you those data after the call.","Javier Escalante","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you for you question. You have no further questions at this time. [Operator Instructions]","Bart Becht","If there are no further questions, again I just thank everybody for being on the call. I'm looking forward to talking to you in a couple of months. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may disconnect. Have a good day."],"6333":["Coty, Inc.

My name is Crystal and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Quarterly Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Monaco. Mr. Monaco, you may begin your conference.","Kevin Monaco - Coty, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Camillo Pane, Chief Executive Officer; and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Global Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where we list factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. All commentary on organic net revenues reflect the comparison of combined net revenues at constant currency in both the current and prior-year periods, excluding the impact of acquisitions other than the acquisition of the P&G Beauty Business.","In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Camillo.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everyone, to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings call. Q2 was a very strong quarter marked by Coty's return to organic top line growth. We delivered excellent growth in Luxury, an acceleration in positive momentum in Professional Beauty and a significant improvement in Consumer Beauty. This healthy net revenue performance, coupled with continuous improvement on the cost structure, resulted in significant improvement in profits.","I'm very pleased with these achievements and the progress made so far. However, there is still much work to be done before we achieve the consistent results that we seek, as we still need to relaunch many brands, deliver our synergies, and continue with our integration of the P&G Beauty Business.","Moving on to our divisional performance, the Luxury division delivered outstanding 8.1% organic net revenue growth, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of very strong growth. This excellent performance was fueled by the continued success of our innovation pipeline, including several new launches, leading to growth in all geographies, particularly in travel retail and ALMEA.","We continue building on two successful major new products introduced in the first quarter: Gucci Bloom and Tiffany's debut fragrance. I'm extremely proud that Gucci Bloom was one of the top-ranked fragrance launches in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. In China specifically, Bloom was the number one fragrance launch in the country. In the U.S., Bloom also continued its excellent performance, achieving a nation of top 10 women's fragrance ranking in terms of sellout during the week of Christmas.","Our debut, Tiffany's fragrance, continue to perform exceptionally across all regions, achieving a top 3 new products ranking in most of the doors we launched, an incredible accomplishment for a new brand just introduced into the market last quarter. Tiffany's strong results, particularly in the U.S., Asia and travel retail, are extremely encouraging.","Separately, I'm thrilled to announce the philosophy purity-pore-extractor-mask was the number one prestige skincare launched in the U.S. in 2017. This is another tremendous accomplishment by the Luxury team. Other highlights in Luxury include successful campaigns for Chlo\u00e9 Signature and CK ETERNITY with strong sell-through in several major markets. Our strong performance demonstrates Coty's expertise in developing and bringing Luxury beauty brands to market and speaks to our ability to successfully execute our strategy.","The acquisition of the iconic Burberry brand closed this quarter complements Coty's already strong Luxury portfolio. Our go-to-market strategy for Burberry is evolving as we move the brand from a third-party distributor network to a direct go-to-market strategy in most markets. As expected, we have a high level of inventory that we have to work down, so the second half is anticipated to be a period of transition as we continue to integrate the brand into our Luxury portfolio.","In our Professional Beauty division, net revenue increased 2% organically, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of positive growth. OPI returned to growth globally, growing double-digit in every geographic region. Both gel and lacquers (5:15) grew as a result of a very encouraging initial restage of our gel products line and the launch of a new color collection. Wella Professional sustained its positive performance benefiting from the recent Wellaflex launch. ghd also posted solid organic results boosted by strong e-commerce performance in its main holiday selling season.","In Consumer Beauty, net revenues declined 1.3% on an organic basis, a significant improvement from the prior quarter and year and further evidence of a stabilizing trend for the business. It's worth reminding you though that Consumer Beauty benefited from a favorable comparison this quarter as the prior-year period performance was negatively impacted by transitional issues in parts of the P&G business.","This improved performance against the still weak global mass beauty market provides reassurance that the combination of brand initiatives, improving market execution and consumer-focused communications strategy is supporting the gradual improvement in Consumer Beauty revenue trends. And it's important to keep the focus of the organization on recovering the market share that has been lost over the last several quarters.","Consumer Beauty in North America remained under pressure, driven by the planned winding down of inventory in advance of our pending relaunches, as well as distribution losses from last year, which will anniversary in the second half of fiscal 2018. Our European business improved, primarily as a result of stabilization in the base business. ALMEA grew strongly and continues to be a standout, with double-digit growth across the majority of key geographies.","In Australia, we saw growth in color cosmetics and a return to growth in hair, driven by excellent in-store execution. In Mexico, we continue to gain share in retail hair, achieving the highest share in three years as well as category captaincy in about 80% of the retailers where we are present. In Brazil, we also continue to gain share despite aggressive pricing strategy from competitors. China above-the-market growth is attributable to our new route-to-market strategy, to our own affiliate structure, the pipeline of country-specific innovation and a strong focus on e-commerce.","We have strong plans for several Consumer Beauty brands in the second half of fiscal 2018, including COVERGIRL, Clairol, Max Factor amongst others. For COVERGIRL, the products and fixtures are just now beginning to be rolled out in the different retailers across the U.S. As a reminder, most of the U.S. retailers begin their annual spring (8:05) in mid-January and continue to our fiscal fourth quarter. It's important to note that all of our plans will be set in tune with the trade windows that are prepared by the retailers. Over the next few months, consumers will see new positioning, new creative, new packaging, new innovations, and new store appearance for COVERGIRL.","In the second half of our fiscal year, we're also undertaking a profound relaunch of the Clairol brand and its key pillar, Nice 'n Easy. The relaunch includes revisiting and refocusing a compelling and consumer insight-driven purpose in line with the roots of the brand, launching a new damage blocking technology, revising the architecture of the brand portfolio, and addressing growth segments such as maintenance and artistry. The early feedback is very positive so far, and I look forward to sharing additional updates with you in the second half of fiscal 2018 as new products and fixtures are fully rolled out into shelves. So, though Q2 has shown improvements for Consumer Beauty, it will still take time for the full recovery of the Consumer Beauty business, and results are likely to be uneven from quarter-to-quarter.","Now, I would like to provide a brief update on the key growth pillar from new Coty, which is the acceleration of our end-to-end digital transformation, including e-commerce. With Beamly's help, Coty continues to push the envelope on innovation in digital. In the second quarter, we launched artificial intelligence power tools on boots.com in the UK, which help consumers select fragrances. And as of yesterday, on covergirl.com in the U.S., users are now able to try on products virtually before purchasing them.","Secondly, we have teamed with Amazon to launch Let's Get Ready, a new visual skill designed for Amazon Echo Show. Let's Get Ready is a personalized beauty offering tool that can deliver up to over 2,000 unique combinations of hair, eye, and skin color curated looks and visual tutorials along with recommended products from Coty Consumer Beauty portfolio the users may add directly to their Alexa shopping list. Lastly and most importantly, all three divisions have seen strong and accelerating double-digit growth in e-commerce revenues year-to-date ahead of the market growth.","Younique continued very strong performance with double-digit sales growth in the quarter with several countries increasing at triple-digit rates, including France, Germany and Spain. As of December, Younique had over 230,000 active presenters, an over 20% increase versus the prior year. Now in its fifth year, Younique continue to distinguish itself as a destructive peer-to-peer pure-play e-commerce beauty platform with a highly scalable technology platform.","Across each of our businesses, we continue to see the positive results directly linked to our growth strategy, as discussed in previous quarters. This strategy includes relaunching key brands, actively engaging with retailers to amplify the in-store shopping experience to drive category growth, working on accelerating our time to market with on-trend collection of new products, accelerating our end-to-end digital transformation and driving our e-commerce efforts.","I told you that fiscal 2018 will be a year of stabilization and this is what our results have shown so far. There is still much to do as we need to relaunch many brands, deliver our synergies and continue with our integration of the P&G Beauty Business. We still have work to do here. I remain confident that the real progress we have seen year-to-date, coupled with our commitment to our growth strategy, will continue to move Coty gradually into the path of full recovery.","Based on the much improved results to-date, we have refined our revenue growth objectives for the remainder of the fiscal year. While revenue recovery will not be a straight line, we now aim to deliver positive, but modest, organic net revenue growth for the second half of the year. For margin, we continue to aim for a healthy improvement in the second half of the year versus the prior year, with most of the impact coming in Q4 as we continue to deliver on our merger synergies.","I will now turn the call over to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thank you, Camillo, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another quarter with solid results that gives us tangible signs that our strategy is starting to bear fruit. Our second quarter net revenues were $2.6 billion, a 14.8% increase versus last year, including our acquisition, with our organic net revenue growing a good 2.8% versus prior.","Adjusted gross margin was 61.6%, a 200 basis point decrease year-over-year attributable to the positive momentum in our emerging market Consumer Beauty Business, which has lower gross margin, as well as the comparison to favorable impact in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 following the P&G Beauty Business acquisition.","Fixed cost control continues to be a priority of the company. As a result, our efforts continue to show progress and, combined with the good revenue momentum, is fueling an adjusted operating income of $347.5 million, or a 12.8% increase year-on-year, which represents a profitability of 13.2% of net revenues. We have recorded this quarter an adjusted effective tax rate of 10.3%, which has been positively impacted by $41.8 million of tax benefits upon settlement of certain tax positions.","And now a few words on the Tax Cuts and Job Act which was enacted in December. Our current mix of profitability across the regions means that we expect a neutral impact from the tax rate change. As a result, we expect the adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 to remain at approximately 27% excluding any onetime items. It is fair to say that in the future, the average tax rate could be positively impacted if the profits in the U.S. improve. We estimate that the onetime deemed repatriation tax to be neutral for Coty for both cash and P&L purposes through the use and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.","The adjusted minority interest of $17.3 million reflects the positive momentum of our partnerships, especially Younique that we expect to continue in the second half. All of the above resulted in adjusted net income of $237.2 million or an equivalent adjusted earnings per share of $0.32. Despite the high season that is usually working capital-intensive for us, our continuous focus on cash is driving a healthy free cash flow generation of $196 million this quarter, which bodes well for our intention to deleverage the business over time. During the quarter, we used existing cash on hand to acquire the Burberry Beauty license as well we repaid more than $320 million in debt.","Let me add a few details on our performance per division. First, in Luxury, our gross margin has improved year-on-year, thanks to our creative innovation and good productivity improvement in the supply chain. This, combined with the tight management of our cost structure, resulted in an operating income increase of 28.6% versus prior year despite the initial cost incurred for our Burberry license acquisition. Our Consumer Beauty division has lifted its profitability by 19.4% versus last year to $131.9 million or 11.6% of net revenues, thanks to the good contribution of Younique as well as strong cost discipline.","As far as our Professional division is concerned, the operating margin has been very healthy in Q2 at 16.5%, on the back of a strong holiday season for ghd as well as tight cost structure management for the overall division. It is also worth mentioning that the operating income decline in Professional of 9.8% versus prior year is due mainly to go-to-market changes in OPI to strengthen our position in some key European markets.","We are still very much focusing on progressing on the integration of the P&G Beauty Business and realizing our synergies. I am pleased with the overall progress of the integration efforts as this is helping us to become much more efficient and will simplify our operating model. I am also pleased to report that our synergy delivery is on track to reach our $750 million target over time.","Regarding our rationalization program, whether via divestiture or via discontinuation, it is fair to say that we are making progress, and we are on track with our expectation to announce before the close of fiscal 2018. As already mentioned, this initiative should help to improve our revenue growth trajectory over time while being dilutive to our profitability on a short-term basis. We will elaborate further in due time.","To conclude, although there is still much work to be done, this quarter has been another milestone in the right direction with good financial performance that give us confidence in our objective to deliver modest organic net revenue growth for the second half, as well as healthy operating margin improvement in the second half of the year versus the prior year, with most of the positive impact in Q4.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Please note you will be limited to one question and a related follow-up question until all callers in the queue have posed their question. Once you have asked your related follow-up question, your line will be muted once again. And our first question will come from Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning. I want to start with sales. I understand the revenue progression won't be a straight line, but it's nice to see the fragrance acceleration and the changing Consumer Beauty nonetheless. So, first, on Luxury, were there any particular areas that stood out? Obviously, we know that Gucci and Tiffany were very strong, but was there a surge in travel retail or China or another area relative to your expectations or was there a fairly strong performance across the board?","And then on Consumer, obviously lots going on in terms of the COVERGIRL launch. Is there any need to clear inventory? As you've had discussions with retailers regarding COVERGIRL, what are they thinking? Are they swapping out the old for the new? Have you been able to get incremental shelf space in your existing doors or back into your doors that you've lost in the first place? And also, do you expect to grow the market while you do this? Thanks so much.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Olivia, for the question. Regarding the first one on Luxury, we feel very pleased with the performance of the quarter. The growth has been, I would say, positive and very good across all regions, all the three regions. The one that standout, actually, ALMEA, so our emerging markets and travel retail. China has been clearly a country where we had a very strong performance both with some of the brands that we have in the portfolio, like Marc Jacobs and Chlo\u00e9, but especially with the launches.","So Bloom, I mentioned in the call that it's one of the top launch, actually, in China. And what I can tell you that actually Tiffany in China was launched just 11 days ago because of the Chinese New Year, and the team just informed me that actually Tiffany, in the last 11 days, clearly, with investments because we're in the launch period, but it's the number two fragrance brand in China in the last 11 days. So, this clearly speaks very high about the strength of the brand, but also the quality of the launch that the team is having on Luxury.","And travel retail is also another area where we continue to have a very strong performance in Luxury, ahead of how the market is performing in travel retail. So, that's definitely another highlight. Your second question was about COVERGIRL. So, look, we are in the middle of basically resetting the shelves. So, we have new positioning, new creative, new packaging and new set of innovations. And we now have reset the shelf in three of our four top retailers in the U.S., and the last one is going to start in late February, early March. But the shelf reset initially just happened from mid-January onwards. So it's just a couple of weeks.","And what I just want to mention is that the overall shelf space for COVERGIRL will remain flat, which for us is a positive news after many years of shelf space and distribution declining, all decision which were taken prior to the merger. And we are excited about the plans that we have on COVERGIRL, not only for the innovation but also for the repositioning so, how COVERGIRL will look on the shelf, the new media, the new creative.","Early signs are encouraging. We only have a week of data and a couple of customers but, clearly, we have seen some improvement in the performance. And, therefore, we are, of course, encouraged by that. And the other elements that I can say is that when we went on air with the new creative in the month of November and December, although the shelves reset had not happened, we saw a significant spike in the sales of the product franchises which were put on air. So, again, it's another positive sign that encourages for the coming months. It's clear that we expect an improvement more towards the end of the second half of 2018 for COVERGIRL.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Lachky from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. So, first, I just wanted to clarify your outlook on the top line. Previously, you had said flat organic sales growth and, in the release, you're calling for modest net revenue growth. So, you're kind of going from organic to net. And I don't know, Camillo, maybe you mentioned organic, Patrice, you mentioned net revenue. I'm just, ultimately, is there any change to your organic sales outlook here in the second half? Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Joe, for the question. Yes basically, based on the improved results that we have seen in Q2, we have slightly refined our organic net revenue growth objectives for the remainder of the fiscal year. And although net revenue coverage will not be a straight line, we now aim to deliver organic positive, but modest net revenue growth for the second half of the year. So, from a top line point of view, we have slightly refined our objective for the second half and, yes, on an organic basis, just to clarify your question.","On the other side, on margin, we just continue to aim for a healthy improvement in second half versus the prior year, with most of the impact coming in Q4, because it's in Q4 that we will continue to deliver on our merger synergies. And this objective has not really changed versus what we mentioned in the prior call.","Joe B. Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, my main question on Consumer Beauty, obviously, much improved this quarter. Can you quantify maybe how much of that was like a comp issue, just the easier year-over-year comparison, because it doesn't seem to be much improvement in the U.S. tracked channel data? So, I was just wondering if you have any confidence that underlying results are improving here and you could see continued improvement in the second half. Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. Look, to answer your question, Consumer Beauty declined 1.3%. We believe this is an improvement versus prior quarter and also versus year ago, and the business is stabilizing and is having improvements in several areas. Absolutely, what you mentioned is correct, which is that we do have a favorable comparison versus the previous quarter, which was negatively impacted by the P&G transitional issues. But at the same time, this quarter, we have intentionally held back sales on a couple of big brands, like COVERGIRL and Clairol in the U.S., because we wanted to make way for retailer shelves to replenish a bit of stock before our relaunches. So, if you consider these two factors, we believe that we had sequential improvements this quarter versus the previous quarter in Consumer Beauty.","Operator","Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Now, there is another point, I think, you made, which is the Nielsen data in the U.S. What I would like to point out is that the U.S. data from Nielsen represents around 10% of total Coty consolidated net revenues. So, this is because, clearly, of the size of our U.S. consumer business, of the coverage and also the fact that Nielsen doesn't fully cover online and some specialty channels which continue to grow. So, if you look at this fact, we do have 90% of the company net revenues which are not covered by Nielsen U.S. data. And also, I think, we should also point out that we are growing double-digits in ALMEA, in our emerging markets, across all the three divisions. And ALMEA is not really covered properly by Nielsen, or NPD as a matter of fact.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Faiza Alwy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. So, just a couple of questions from me. First of all, Camillo, could you talk about the increase in the organic growth estimate for the back half and if there's one particular thing that's driving it or if it's a combination of several factors? So, is it sort of your improved outlook on COVERGIRL? Is it ALMEA? Is it Luxury? Sort of what's sort of driving that improved outlook in the back half?","And then, just secondly, if you could comment broadly on how you think about direct-to-consumer, because I thought it was curious sort of the new website that you launched yesterday for COVERGIRL, the Try It website, that you decided to go with Walmart for that particular item. I just thought that was curious. If you could maybe comment on that and just how you think about DTC broadly? Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Faiza. Regarding the outlook, as you know, we don't give outlook by division. But, I think it's fair to say that to achieve our overall objectives, to have modest positive growth in the second half, this relies on Consumer Beauty having sequential improvement in the second half of fiscal 2018. So, I think that's probably sufficient to explain, also, if you consider the continued growth in Luxury and Professional Beauty and you look at what I just said on Consumer Beauty, that probably explains why we have slightly refined our outlook for the second half.","Regarding the direct-to-consumer, I think what is important to point out is that we are definitely seeing a much stronger focus on e-commerce since we have announced, now, a few months ago that we were going to change drastically the focus on e-commerce within the organization. So, we're seeing, actually, an acceleration and double-digit growth ahead of the market in all the three divisions in e-commerce. And we are working very hard on digital innovation, which is an area in which we're putting a lot of focus with the help of our agency, Beamly.","And what we announced for COVERGIRL is absolutely a way to increase connection with consumers and clearly, also, conversions. And the partnership with Walmart is a very strong partnership. Walmart is a very important customer for us. And in the case of this innovation on COVERGIRL, we have struck this partnership for the virtual makeup look try-on on the new COVERGIRL website. But as I mentioned in my script, we have another partnership on fragrance with boots.com. And clearly, we have many others with our customers, which we'll not mention at this time, but they are in the works. So, I would say it's a wider type of acceleration on digital innovation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. Your line is open.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I know you talked a little bit about the moving pieces of gross margin versus operating margin, but can you just remind us, number one, do you have a long-term target for gross margin? And sort of directionally, obviously, we know the margin split on the operating margin side across the segments, but how different are the gross margins by segment as well? Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, thanks for the question. So, on the gross margin, first, we don't give any indication of gross margin by division, and we don't, also, give any indication on our long-term target. This being said, it's fair to say that if you want to achieve the high teens of operating margin that we have declared already a few quarters ago, we're going to have to work on our gross margin, and it will be positively impacted by the synergies, also.","Now, on this specific quarter, what I would like to point out is a couple of things. First, this quarter is not indicative of our future gross margin expectation, particularly as our synergies are realized. Second, there is a decrease of the gross margin by 200 basis points, which is attributable to the positive momentum as we said of our emerging market in Consumer Beauty business but also as a comparison to favorably impact in fiscal 2017. What I mean by this is that we inherited from our balance sheet a positive manufacturing variance due to the very high volume that was triggered in Q1 last year, and that we released in the Q2 fiscal 2017 books of Coty. And so that has created a positive impact in the gross margin in fiscal 2017. So, that's really the two bulk of the explanation.","There is also a small explanation that has to do with the fact that we are doing all these new launches in Consumer Beauty, especially COVERGIRL that has a slight effect on the gross margin with the reset. But once again, it's very important to point out that this quarter is not indicative of future gross margin expectation.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And just following up on that, so as the COVERGIRL relaunch and we get Clairol and Max Factor and other things as we go through the course of the year, is the promotional activity expected to tick up? I'm just wondering how much of a pressure on gross margin that might be in the second half.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Look, we have strong promotional plans for, I would say, the three major brands we're relaunching, which is the one you mentioned, so the COVERGIRL, the Clairol and the Max Factor. But we don't expect overall the total company to have an effect on gross margin that is significant by the, I would say, additional strong effort. Without any doubt, what we expect is really a strong investment behind these brands for the second half of 2018, as you would expect, we'll all relaunch them across different markets and in different parts of the brand itself with the retailers and therefore there will be strong investment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Coyne from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the progress you're making with the influencer community? Specifically in COVERGIRL, I know you're replacing 25% of the product line with new products. Do you think that's enough? Have you gotten any feedback from the influencer community on that? And then secondly, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on any entry into the prestige cosmetics market with Gucci and Burberry in China or in the U.S. Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","In terms of the innovation that we have on COVERGIRL, we have strong feedback in general from consumers. As you can imagine, we do extensive testing as well before deciding where to allocate our investments and, of course, what to lunch. And so, when I think about the Vitalist Foundation or the Katy Kat Lip Gloss or the Peacock Flare Mascara, they're all being received positively and that includes also influencers. Within our process, we always work with influencers. And actually, we are strengthening our effort to partner with influencers in the preparation of launches as well as of course in our communication strategy. Regarding the prestige cosmetic market, so in Luxury, we have two brands where we're playing in prestige cosmetics, so that's Gucci prestige cosmetics. And now, we also have Burberry within our portfolio. And it's fair to say that we're going to work on strengthening our plans on these two brands over the next quarters.","Shannon Coyne - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark Stiefel Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, thanks and good morning everybody. Wanted to ask about how we should think about current debt levels and the timeline for deleverage including, if you could give some color into expectations as we head into next year? I mean maybe relative to some of the investments that you had outlined about a year ago in terms of how to think about cash conversion. And then I guess more broadly even with some pay down, debt levels are still going to be pretty high relative to perhaps some other companies, I suppose. How do you think about that from a flexibility standpoint to go out and do meaningful M&As you've talked about? And would you consider creative solutions, I suppose, in terms of being able to pay down debt or do deals in the future?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Thanks for your question, Mark. So as you know, we are not going to comment on our M&A journey and on potential structure. What I can comment is on our current level of debt and the leverage. So, first you will have noticed that in Q2 we have already paid down $320 million of debt. So this is a clear signal that we are sending, that we are very much focusing on deleveraging the business. This being said, the current leverage that we have is at 4 times. That give us still some flexibility, but it's very important to point out, as I've already mentioned in the previous quarters, that one of our focus for the time being is to deleverage the business. And so we have started to that in Q2, and we keep on doing that in the coming years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is open.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a little bit about emerging markets. So, the performance this quarter was obviously great, and some of it, I think, this hasn't really been discussed much before as an enormous area of focus. So, I was hoping, one, if you could share with us roughly how big China is now. I know Max Factor launched on JD.com in the fall. Was Max Factor a well-established brand already in China, or was that really kind of the brand's launch? And then, also for Bourjois, which I think is going on JD well. Same kind of question, is that already an established brand, or is that really a new launch? And then in Brazil, you had mentioned price competition. And I was just curious if that was from other local players or from more global brands in the market. Thanks.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Lauren. Yes. We're having a very strong growth in emerging markets. We're very pleased with it. We have decided to focus much more with our merger on specific countries, and we're seeing very interesting fruits from our investments and the changes we made. I think if I focus on China for a second, first of all, I would like to remind that we have changed go-to-market strategy, moving from distributor network to affiliates, so our own organization, in both Luxury and Consumer Beauty, at the time of the merger in both divisions which was a very bold move, but definitely is paying the results. And so, we're seeing accelerated growth in both divisions actually, as a matter of fact, in all the three division in China.","Going to your question regarding Consumer Beauty, Max Factor was an established brand in China, but clearly was not necessarily performing well, under previous management or ownership, let's say, because also the distributor network that I was mentioning before. So, under the stewardship and leadership of our team it's now performing incredibly well, including an acceleration in e-commerce, because we have strengthened the capabilities in the area.","On the other side, Bourjois is a new brand which has just got launched in China just few weeks ago. So, this is all new and we have encouraging results from the first couple of weeks. We have seen, we have new in-store execution in different department stores and different malls and so far, we're seeing encouraging results. And I also want to mention in the Luxury division, philosophy which is also a new brand in China. We have launched it on Tmall three months ago, I think it is now, and we also opened a store in Shanghai and results are ahead of expectations. So, it's a mix of revitalizing established brands and launching new ones.","Regarding Brazil, the comment that I made in terms of competitive pressure on pricing, it was referred to the deodorant segments where we have been enjoying very high level of growth and market share gain which clearly has made our competitors both multi-nationals and local react to our strategy. And this is two particularly brand, but the main one is called Monange which I have highlighted in the press release.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And then assuming that the standout performance in emerging markets this quarter is something that is more the beginning of a trend, and you mentioned it as a pressure point on gross margins, why wouldn't that continue, or was it anything particular to the quarter with the mix of emerging markets growth that it was more of an issue?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","So, first, Lauren, good morning. So, on that specific question on the pressure in emerging market, that is true. This being said, what you need to factor into the equation is that you're going to start to see all the synergies for manufacturing footprint, and logistic footprint kicking in. And this is going to provide quite some support in terms of gross margin, point one. Point two, we are gradually premiumizing our business with innovation, and you see that for instance, in the Luxury segments where the innovations are quite accretive from a gross margin standpoint. Some of our acquisitions, also, are quite accretive from a gross margin, if I think about Burberry, for instance. So, these are things that we are currently building to make sure that we have a premiumization on our gross margin going forward.","The other point that I'd like to mention is on this emerging market infrastructure. We have deliberately made the decision to take some hits in some of the previous quarters in terms of cost structure because we were convinced that, from a long-term standpoint, we have to capture the (42:47), and especially in emerging markets. And we didn't have the right infrastructure. As a result of that, we have built the right infrastructure, either by acquisition with (42:56) or organically by going to affiliates, and this is now starts to pay off. So, it's very, very important that everybody factor that into the equation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to focus on the advertisement on the back end of this year. And so, are you going to see more reinvestment of the synergies in marketing to support the brands relaunch? And can you give us an update on the pace of the synergies? I understand it's going to be more back-loaded into the fourth quarter, but it will be helpful to see how you're going to be seeing that either reinvested or flowing to the bottom line.","And also, on a clarification on the previous question, you said you're maintaining shelf space intact for COVERGIRL, which is obviously positive. But can you comment, also, on the other brands, like Sally Hansen, Rimmel, and also including the hair color, and if Coty as a whole has been able to maintain shelf space or if there will be some of the other color cosmetics brand losing space in order to give more shelf to COVERGIRL? Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Andrea. Regarding the advertising for the second half, it's fair to say that, especially on COVERGIRL and Clairol and Max Factor, we will invest more heavily in Q3 and Q4. But overall, when you look at our overall portfolio, we don't expect our advertising investments to drastically go up versus the level that we mentioned in the past of 25%, 26%.","The second point that I will cover is shelf space, and then I'll give \u2013 Patrice, will cover synergies. When I look at the shelf space for total Coty, actually, in the U.S., we expect our shelf space to be overall flat. And you mentioned a couple of other brands, so I'll cover that as well. On Clairol, we now know clearly, because we are in February, all the shelf resets have been decided, let's say, although not fully implemented. But on Clairol, we also expected our shelf space to be flat. The same is on Sally Hansen, and probably it'll be a slightly decline on Rimmel, but it's very minimal. It's driven mainly by one customer, which doesn't represent a big percentage of the brand globally, and also in the U.S. And Rimmel, I want to remind that 85% of the sales in Rimmel are clearly made in Europe and in emerging markets where Rimmel is a very large brand.","So, overall, in total, Coty, as I said, is flat. And for me, this is a good performance. And I'm pleased with the achievement of the team because this comes after, especially on the ex-P&G brands, for many years of shelf space reduction and distribution losses; and, as I said, decisions which were taken prior to the merger, which in the space of 14 months, 15 months, we have been able to revert and stop this decline through the work of the team on the product campaigns and positioning and so on. Patrice, synergies?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Coty, Inc.","Yes. So, on the synergies, so the phasing is still the same. So, we are going to achieve 50% of the synergies by the end of fiscal 2018, 80% by the end of fiscal 2019 and 100% afterwards, by 2020. So, this is not changing. What we said, also, is that the Q4 is going to be positively impacted by the synergies being realized. Now, on the way, our investment thesis is that the synergies would fall bottom line. But it could be that one quarter or a couple of quarters, we're going to dial it up in order to be able to fuel the top line. We've done that in the past, and this is the right thing to do. So, we are going to remain opportunistic. This being said, it's clear that, from an annual trend standpoint (46:54) is still roughly at 25%, 26%. But we are going to keep on being opportunistic quarter-after-quarter depending on how we see the innovation and in order to further fuel the top line if we think this is the right thing to do.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steph Wissink from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Hi, good morning, everyone. Just a quick clarification question on the Luxury segment. I know you talked about several fragrance launches over the last couple of quarters. Can you give us some insight into the pipeline for the second half of the fiscal year? And then, I wanted to also follow-up on the comments regarding your direct-to-consumer. I think that was largely focused in the Consumer segment and, potentially, Luxury, but how about the Professional segment? Is that an area where you could leverage some of that platform investment and build maybe a direct-to-professional business like some of your peers? I'm thinking about brands like Wella. Are there opportunities to go direct and maybe work around the traditional distributor network? Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","Thanks, Steph. So, regarding the Luxury pipeline for the second half, we believe \u2013 I personally believe that this is strong. We just announced the launch of Chlo\u00e9 Nomade. And we just launched actually, Gucci Guilty Absolute for female where we have encouraging results from travel retail, but also from several department stores. We have a new campaign on a CK ONE, which just got launched, and we have the continuation of the ETERNITY campaign which is going well. So, there is a lot of things going on and clearly there will be more announcement to come, which I will not disclose in this call over the end of Q4.","Regarding the direct-to-consumers, as I mentioned, we are seeing accelerated double-digit growth ahead of the market across the three divisions. Now, focusing on the profession which is the one you mentioned, we have two areas where we are investing which are giving us encouraging and significant results. One is MyWellaStore.com, which is our B2B platform where we engage directly with stylers and hair dressers, and we are seeing significant growth in this platform not only in the U.S. but also in other European markets and other markets where we are launching that. And we, of course, continue to with the rollout \u2013 we plan to continue with the rollout. And the second one is ghd. ghd has a significant percentage of sales and their revenue is coming from B2C. And in Q2, this part, or this channel, the e-commerce sales, both on the ghdhair.com but also in the e-retailers and few players it's been very positive. So, the combination of both is helping the e-commerce for Professionals to go well as well.","Stephanie Wissink - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge. Your line is open.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thank you very much. Just in Consumer Beauty, is it fair to say that your North America versus international business, just focusing in on North America, was better than your expectations because of the factors you've cited in a couple \u2013 despite some of the actions you took in advance of the COVERGIRL refresh? And as part of that, as we look to the second half of the year, would you expect that at some point to inflect positive, because it sounds like you have, in effect, pushed out some sales. So, should that North America piece really start to turn positive at some point in the next couple of quarters? Thank you.","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","So thank you, Jonathan. The North American sales for Consumer Beauty in Q2 were definitely affected by an intentional decrease of our inventory. And we decided to do this, which I had mentioned it already in the previous call, so it was in our plans to make space and reduce the inventory ahead of the relaunch of COVERGIRL and Clairol as well. We did that because clearly we wanted to accelerate the arrival of the new packaging and the new innovation on shelf across all the different retailers. That said, it's important to remember that we are not doing a hard cutover across all the SKUs for COVERGIRL. We're doing that just for around 25%, which is the innovation. So, the rest is going to be a gradual phase-in, which will take time. So, we don't expect to have all the new SKUs of COVERGIRL with the new packaging, the new look to be across all retailers before Q1 fiscal 2019, just to clarify that.","So, that was your one question. The second part is, if we do expect North American sales improving, yes, of course, we are relaunching the two major brands that we have in North America. So, COVERGIRL and Clairol, and we do expect a sequential improvement of North America Consumer Beauty in the second half of 2018.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","But would you expect them to be up year-over-year?","Camillo Pane - Coty, Inc.","As you know, we're making several relaunches in the same time. So, we are putting a lot of investment behind many changes in the same time. But this sequential improvement, we expect at some point on specific brands, to bring some of the brands to positive growth. But I'm not going to comment on the overall North American business, which is a much larger business than these specific brands.","Operator","Thank you.

You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Pane.","Camillo Pane","Thank you, Christie, and welcome everybody to Coty fiscal 2019 first quarter conference call. We are very disappointed with the supply chain disruptions we have experienced over the last quarter and the resulting poor Q1 financial performance. While we had anticipated some level of disruption in the first quarter from warehousing and planning consolidation, the increased scope of the disruptions resulted in much weaker results than previously expected.","We have been working hard to remedy the supply chain issues and expect to temper the headwinds in the second quarter, and have them be substantially resolved in the third quarter, although we do not expect to fully recover the Q1 financial impact in the balance of fiscal 2019. As a result of these disruptions, we have decided to modify our distribution center consolidation plan for the remainder of the year to minimize business impact. With a healthy synergy delivery already in Q1, these modifications should have no impact to our commitment of $225 million of synergies in fiscal 2019 and $750 million of synergies by the end of fiscal 2020.","By division, underlying consumer demand in Luxury and Professional Beauty remains strong, but the underlying performance of consumer beauty remains challenged. Our immediate focus in the business right now is three-pronged. First, to resolve the supply chain disruption. Second, to improve underlying performance in consumer beauty, and third, to improve cash flow generation.","So let\u2019s get into the results. First quarter revenues declined 7.7% on a like-for-like basis, as we encountered temporary supply chain headwinds. Alongside, the previously flagged supply chain issues affecting consumer beauty and professional beauty, our Luxury division was also impacted in Q1 by a disruption in European warehouse, by the U.S. Hurricane and by component shortages of certain external suppliers.","All of this factors cumulatively impacted our topline by close to 5% and without the drag of the disruption, we believe that our underlying net revenue would only have declined by about 2.5%.","The adjusted gross margin of 60.4% decreased by 120 basis points in the first quarter, primarily driven by the impact of supply chain disruption on both Consumer Beauty and Luxury. Our A&CP investments remain in the range of 23% of net revenue in the quarter, only modestly below last year and consistent with our targeted trend.","Importantly, we have made significant progress in the past few months in addressing our fixed cost base, with controllable fixed cost down mid single digits during the first quarter versus the prior year on the back of the synergy programs. This support the delivery of an adjusted operating income of $141 million, a decrease of 28% versus the prior year, which was driven by the net revenue gross margin contraction, as well as a 4% headwind on exchange rate.","The synergies delivered in the first quarter were in line with our target, but were more than offset by the supply chain related headwinds, which we estimate impacted operating income by about $60 million despite the underlying deterioration in consumer beauty. Total EPS for the quarter was $0.11, which reflects 10% growth versus last year, driven by favorable tax outcome, which added $0.04 to EPS. Before moving to divisional results, I want to elaborate on the supply chain disruption that meaningfully impacted our performance this quarter.","I would like to remind you that our end stage design for our supply chain is intended to assure a streamlined, agile and efficient organization, not only fit for future growth, but one which will serve as a long-term foundation for best-in-class operational efficiency. To this end, during the last 24 months, we have shutdown three factories, restructured the fourth one, consolidated several supply chain planning locations into three planning hubs, consolidated six distribution centers, and exited TSA agreements in our 30 countries.","From a regional perspective, the changes to our supply chain foot print implemented so far represents about 80% of the planned supply chain transformation formally the merger. Frustratingly, toward the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we started to encounter several supply chain challenges in two of our three locations in the U.S. and Europe, which includes the ramp-up of the consumer beauty planning hub and manufacturing plant in the UK and the consolidation of a professional beauty distribution center in the U.S.","Additionally, in mid September, we discovered a partner issue related to the consolidation of the Luxury distribution center in Europe. Today, I want to focus my comments on the actual plans we have put into place to address each of these issues and contain the duration of the impact. We are working strictly to confine the majority of the impact of these temporary disruptions to the first half of fiscal 2019, although we expect some residual impact in the third quarter. Specifically in the UK, we took action to move volume to other consumer beauty brands. We expect the service level to be restored in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.","In North America, we had implemented an actual plan with our third-party warehouse partner to improve service level, while we drive key clients. And we also expected this to be largely resolved during the second quarter. The Luxury warehouse issue is related to tight capacity and initial integration challenges particularly impacted the travel retail channel. By using another warehouse nearby, and prioritizing the customers, we expect to have largely restored service level by the end of the second quarter.","These internal headwinds which account for about two-thirds of the supply chain related profit impact in the first quarter were compounded by two external factors that mainly affected the Luxury division. We are addressing the shortage of component parts, in two key Luxury suppliers that provided pumps and glass bottles and expect to resolve this issue during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.","The impact of Hurricane Florence which hit the U.S. in September and constrained our ability to move products to and from our distribution center in North Carolina is expected to fully reverse in the second quarter. We estimate that the total impact of the supply chain related headwinds was about $100 million on top line and approximately $6 million on operating profit. Although we clearly took a calculated risk by making many fundamental changes to our footprint over a short period, these related disruptions have made us realize that we must carefully balance our remaining integration plans with the needs of our business and customers.","As a result, we have decided to modify our distribution center consolidation plan for the remainder of fiscal 2019, to minimize these disruption. With a healthy synergy delivery already in Q1, this consolidation modification should have no impact on our commitment of $225 million of synergies in fiscal 2019 and $750 million by the end of fiscal 2020. That said, we acknowledge the synergies captured during the first quarter did not allowed for profit conversion as the supply chain disruption coupled with weakness in consumer beauty developed markets, more than offset the synergies captured.","We expect the conversion rate of synergies into profit to increase in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2019. While the impact of these factors has been significant to our first quarter results, I want to emphasis that the supply chain headwinds are a temporary setback in achieving our financial targets. Our confidence is underpinned by strong underlying consumer demand in Luxury and Professional Beauty, where market share remained healthy and the fact that both divisions where we reported solid net revenue growth in Q1, consistent with their full year 2018 trend, if it were not for the supply chain disruptions.","However, underlying results for Consumer Beauty are not where they should be and we are accelerating a number of strategic interventions which I will cover in a moment. To that end, let me quickly remind you of the earnings model that underpins all of our strategic choices. Our target is to deliver flat to modest top line growth, combined with our ongoing focus on reducing costs, even after the synergies are fully delivered, and this underpins our medium term target of achieving a high-teens adjusted operating margin over the next five years.","We believe that each of our division played a unique role in helping us to achieve this margin structure and profit growth. Specifically, we look for Luxury to sustain its above market topline expansion fueled by our strong innovation capabilities, geographic expansion and ongoing developments of our Prestige skincare color cosmetics offerings.","In Professional Beauty, we look to accelerate our growth by maximizing the untapped potential of OPI and ghd, while capitalizing on the market leading position of Wella, our largest portfolio brand with over $1 billion in revenues. In Consumer Beauty, we aim to initially stabilize the division topline and improve the margins, and I will get into further details shortly. Our strategy to drive growth continues to be focused on four distinct pillars, which are equally relevant for all three divisions.","It includes focusing on brands which matter and have potential, on driving innovation and in-store execution much harder, on rapid expansion in the emerging ALMEA markets and on digital transformation. On this last point, we saw continued momentum in e-Commerce across all three divisions in the first quarter.","Now, let me dig deeper into our performance by division. Luxury net revenue declined by 2.1% like-for-like. This was fully driven by the internal and external temporary supply headwinds we experienced. Excluding these factors, we estimate Luxury like-for-like net revenue in the quarter would have grown close to 5%, consistent with fiscal 2018 performance. Despite the supply chain headwinds, Luxury was still able to deliver 15% profit growth and 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement.","It\u2019s important to again emphasize that e-market performance of our brands, confirms our view that momentum for our Luxury brand portfolio remains robust. Sell-through of our brand during the quarter was strong and we are particularly pleased by the share gains we saw in Europe and across several brands including Gucci, Tiffany, Marc Jacobs and Chloe. Despite the fact, that Gucci, Tiffany lapped strong launches from the first quarter of last year.","As we enter second quarter, we had two important innovations in the market, including Hugo Boss scent and Burberry Her, both of which are off to a promising start. It\u2019s worth noting that Q2 will be the first quarter when Burberry is included in our like-for-like numbers. Finally, I\u2019m pleased with the very strong momentum we saw in Luxury commerce with significant growth across nearly all of our leading brand.","In professional beauty, we experienced a similar dynamic as in Luxury with the supply chain issues masking the strong market fundamentals of our brand portfolio. Professional Beauty net revenues declined 2.6% like-for-like in the quarter with the disruption of service level at our North America distribution center having a significant negative impact on our North American hair and nail businesses. Without these headwinds we estimate like-for-like net revenue will increase about 1.5% in the quarter, relatively consistent with the trend in the last seven quarters.","We see no underlying change for customer demand for our brands in North America, which remains strong. We continue to see solid momentum in other parts of the division with low single digit growth in Europe and high single digit growth in ALMEA and ghd. I\u2019m very pleased with how the professional beauty team capitalized on a number of strong innovation in the quarter, including the restage of Wella Koleston Perfect with the breakthrough ME+ color technology, which was just launched in Europe and will roll out in other parts of the world over the course of fiscal 2019.","We\u2019re also excited about the debut of ghd Platinum+ styler, our first to incorporate predictive technology to consumer\u2019s hair coloring and styling approaches. Despite the supply chain headwinds, which impacted OPI\u2019s momentum, we are pleased with the strong performance of the brand\u2019s recent collections. We continue to see strong momentum in our e-commerce business, including the roll out of our new D2C platform mywellastore.com in the U.S. and coming soon in several countries in Europe.","From a profitability standpoint, despite the supply chain disruptions, Professional Beauty grew adjusted operating income by 41% and delivered 190 basis points of margin improvement. The combination of several internal and external factors drove a very weak results in Consumer Beauty as the 14% like-for-like net revenue decline included growth of the 5% of headwinds from the supply chain disruption.","Excluding this, top line would have declined by about 9%, a result that is still much weaker than our ambition for the division. The sequential deterioration in Consumer Beauty business trends reflect the knock-on effect of the supply chain disruption, as we invested more with our customers, including increased promotional activity which reduced net revenues. Our results were partly impacted by the continued weakness in U.S. and Europe, mass beauty categories with previously flat distribution losses leading to a deterioration in share.","The net result of these top line headwinds was that the first quarter adjusted operating income was $14.8 million, a significant decline versus the prior year period, with a disappointing adjusted operating margin, 1.8%. Against these overall results, there are a number of commercial highlights that I want to call out in the quarter. Despite the supply chain disruption, which hampered Rimmel and Max Factor sales in all geographies, the EMEA region was modestly positive and importantly, our brands continue to gain share in these regions, including our Brazilian business continuing to grow share and delivering strong top line growth while driving a significant improvement in gross margin.","By category in retail hair, our largest brand Wella experienced solid net revenue growth and share gains in a number of emerging markets, fueled by hair color and hair styling products. Our color cosmetics category experienced the biggest contraction in Q1 reflecting the significant impact of the supply chain disruption and ongoing pressure on home sales group.","As we continue to strengthen CoverGirl, after our launch, the brand improved its leadership position in face with TruBlend Matte Made becoming the number one face launch of the season and showed progress in earned media value or EMV in recent months, a key brand health indicator. As we announced on Monday, CoverGirl became the largest cosmetic brand to earn the gold standard Cruelty Free certification, by Cruelty Free International.","This is a compelling proposition for our consumers and we have received very positive feedback from our customers. And last but not least, we\u2019re looking forward to the opening of our CoverGirl flagship store in Times Square at the end of this month. For Younique, while sales trends improved sequentially, first quarter profit performance was below the business\u2019s long term trajectory as strong presenter sponsorship and growth in overall revenues were more than offset by increased promotional activity and compensation plan adjustments.","While these adjustments have not translated into improved presenter retention at the pace initially expected, we believe that traction in the new subscription and loyalty programs, factored compensation plan refinements and the continued broadening of the Younique portfolio will support strong momentum in Younique in the coming years. In total, performance in the Consumer Beauty division remains well below our goals of stabilization and predictability.","We are taking decisive action with a significant sense of urgency to shore up the division in the short term. The critical first half year is strengthening operational discipline, we particularly focus on restoring service level in the coming quarters, fortifying our innovation and focus on execution, and driving disciple in trade and promotional spend, particularly once supply chain headwinds abate.","Beyond that, we are first refocusing investment from the mainly low priority brand-country combinations toward more a subset of higher potential combination. Not surprisingly, this includes Covergirl in the U.S. and our strong Wella business in ALMEA among others. We believe these reallocation will allow us to earn a high return in our investments. Second, we are continuing to drive these cost savings inline with the division top line trajectory.","Third, we are accelerating investments toward numerous channels, including improvements to our e-commerce capabilities by adopting our supply chain product assortment and creative assets. We expect a positive impact from these actions over the course of fiscal 2019, though turnarounds are rarely linear, and much work needs to be done to stabilize and ultimately expand shares in Consumer Beauty.","I\u2019ve already covered the most significant drivers of the operational results. So, let me briefly touch on the other financial metrics in particular, the drivers of EPS and the increase in our leverage. Our first quarter adjusted net income of $80.5 million grew 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to a one-time $32 million tax benefit in the quarter, coupled with lower interest expense, which was tied to higher Euro borrowings during the first quarter.","In Q1, net cash provided by operating activities was negative $82 million and free cash flow was negative $250 million, primarily driven by continued pressure on working capital and over $15 million increase in one time cash costs. It\u2019s important to emphasize, the impact of our supply chain headwinds on our net working capital and the need to shift production and build up safety stock pressured on our inventories, while customer relationship was strained making trade terms optimization more difficult.","As we work to quickly remediate the effect of the supply chain disruptions and drive profit improvement, we will expect our free cash flow and net working capital bonds to improve over the course of the year. Net debt of $7.6 billion on September 30, 2018 increased by $370 million from the balance of $7.292 billion on June 30, 2018, resulting in a last 12 months net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.8 times, compared with our June 30, 2018 ratio of 5.3 times.","This net debt increase which we had flat last quarter reflects a negative free cash flow, the dividend payment of $94 million and the payment for the Escada license of $41 million. Let\u2019s now turn to the outlook and how we see our business evolving in the second quarter and remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we expect underlying the revenue trends to improve versus first quarter across whole three divisions inclusive of expected supply chain headwinds specifically, we look for Luxury and Professional Beauty to return to like-for-like net revenue growth in the second quarter, while Consumer Beauty like-for-like trends should improve to a high-single digit decline.","For adjusted operating income, we expect Q2 adjusted operating income to be moderately lower versus year ago, driven by the remaining supply chain impacts and FX headwinds. The second quarter adjusted EPS comparison versus the prior year will be pressured by the $42 million positive tax settlement recorded in 2Q of last year.","Looking to fiscal 2019, despite the supply chain headwinds, we continue to expect operating profit and margin growth in fiscal 2019, driven by significant progress in fixed cost reductions and synergy delivery. However, we need more time to assess the financial impacts of the continuing supply disruptions and, at this stage, we are not providing any further guidance, but expect to provide an update on our outlook on the next earnings call.","Deleveraging remains a top priority in fiscal 2019 and beyond, we remain committed to our target of achieving a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of below four times, by the end of calendar 2020 and we expect positive free cash flow in the remaining quarters and overall in fiscal 2019.","Our liquidity position is substantial, with significant flexibility from over $2 billion of revolver availability. Our mid-term goals remains one of delivering consistent, modest net revenue growth with continuous margin expansion. This, coupled with our dividend payout should drive a superior total shareholder return.","To conclude, Q1 was a setback in achieving our financial targets and build strategic goals, driven by our temporary supply chain headwinds. However, we remain absolutely convinced that our fast-paced and ambitious transformational agenda including comprehensive changes to processes, systems, culture and people, is ultimately building a much stronger Coty for the long term.","As we overcome the internal supply headwinds and complete all other major integration-related milestones, we will increasingly shifting our focus from being largely internal to fully external, and we will be able to see improved performance across all the areas.","I am proud of how the team is addressing the challenges with a very strong ownership mindset. And I see tremendous potential for Coty to create significant value for our shareholders and consumers in the coming years.","Now, I will turn the line back to Kristy to open up the lines for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning Camillo and thank you for all that detail, both in the release and going through in your prepared remarks, it was really helpful. And I wanted to ask first just about the profit impact of the supply chain issues, because if I recall coming into the fiscal year, we had talked about there being almost a $100 million headwind from just the integration-related issues on supply chain, in this quarter, you called that it being around $60 million, so is part of this and any this ties to the discussion of it being casted \u2013 forecasted financial impacts, but was there some almost delay in things have slowed down, but the cost is taking longer to work through it, I just, there does seem to be a bit of a gap in how we\u2019re thinking about the impact on operating profits.","You said it wasn\u2019t what we expected it to be, was the first question. The second was on the Luxury componentry issue. Is there any reason to tie this to some of your cost saving efforts? So whether it\u2019s a choice of suppliers, things that you\u2019ve done and how you\u2019re working with those suppliers that ultimately had a knock on certain ability to access the necessary component trade. Thanks.","Camillo Pane","Thanks, Lauren. Looking at the \u2013 your first question, which is the supply chain, what we said in the previous quarters so at the end of 2018 in August is that we were expecting an overall full year impact from supply chain headwinds of $50 million on OI [ph]. What happened in reality is that we had $60 million just in Q1, and the reality is that at the time of the 2018 earnings if we knew of some of the supply chain disruptions and \u2013 which were, of course drove our outlook that we gave, what happened is sequentially we learned of new supply chain issues in the Luxury warehouse in Germany, and we were also impacted by U.S. hurricane in mid-September, both of these were not known to us and together represents almost 60% of the impact that we suffered in Q1. So out of $60 million almost 60% comes out of these two headwinds, which we were not aware.","We also need to remember that September is a peak demand month for Luxury, and clearly, this further exacerbated the impact of the supply chain disruption. And we have to place a lot of actions of course to address and contain the duration of the impact, we are rebalancing the supply chain, we are rebalancing the production and the logistics within our network.","We\u2019re working with our supply base better to ensure sufficient component supply and I\u2019ll mention it in your question there, and one of the things we have done because of the disruptions in the magnitude of the disruption in Q1 is that we have made modifications to our consolidation plans for the remainder of the year.","And we have delayed or modified pre-planned consolidation that we are going to have and we are going to have in the second part and we of course we did this to balance better the need of finalizing the integration with the need of our customers and consumers until we minimize the business impact.","And this is why we said that although it\u2019s possible that there might be some residual disruption in the second half, we\u2019re working swiftly to basically confine the impact of these disruptions to the first half.","Looking at the \u2013 at your second question which is the component issues. I think it\u2019s driven by a couple of things. Yes, it is true that we have of course streamline that were supply base because that\u2019s part of our journey to become more efficient, agile and to decrease our cost base.","But in this case, I would say the majority of problems came from two problems, one is our increased demand. We\u2019re going well in Luxury and therefore, we are increasing demand of our components.","And then second there are couple of key suppliers specifically for pumps and bottles enter into problems, into shortages, not only with us, but also in general with the industry. And the combination of our higher demand and these shortages from the suppliers meant that they are having an impact, which we didn\u2019t really realize that it would have been this significant.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you very much. Two questions. Can you talk a little bit about how you\u2019re thinking about promotions on the consumer retail side, on the one hand if it doesn\u2019t seem like you have the products, then why are you doing the promotions, or is it just to accelerate the cleanup of the old inventory in the U.S. mass retailers?","And then just kind of stepping back in terms of the whole consumer business, can you give us a little bit more of a sense of what the performance was on the top line for U.S. retail or European retail Younique in Brazil?. Thank you very much.","Camillo Pane","Thanks Robert for the questions. And when I look at the promotional intensity, this is driven by a couple of issues. One is, yes, we do have supply chain headwinds and problems and that basically means that we have \u2013 more of a distributor issue with the retailers, which leads to penalties, because we\u2019re not able to maintain the service level that we are supposed to. So that\u2019s one of the driver of the increased spend.","The second one is that, we wanted to increase the support to our brands in store, while we were seeing the issue in the supply chain, but it\u2019s not like that the supply chain issues where across the entire portfolio. And this is why you have these effects. In terms of the consumer beauty performance in the different regions that you mentioned, let me start with the U.S.","U.S. is a mix situation because we do have an improvement in CoverGirl, CoverGirl continues to have performance in the mid-single-digit decline, while the rest of the brands is more of a high single-digit decline in the U.S., and when I look at CoverGirl, there is a lot of also positive things which are happening on the brand, which are moving the performance, progressively and sequentially toward a better and slower decline versus the past.","And I can potentially talk later about this. And in Europe, now \u2013 in Europe, clearly, we suffered, the majority of the supply chain headwinds is happening in consumer beauty in Europe because this is the stronghold region for both Max Factor and Rimmel and the issue we have in our planning hubs in the UK were mostly related to Rimmel and Max Factor.","So again, high single-digit decline in Europe because of most of the supply chain, and Brazil is a different story. In Brazil, we are doing well, and we are growing twice as fast our second competitor, and we are the fastest growing multinational company in Beauty in Brazil.","Our strategy of \u2013 that we \u2013 that really impacted our results in 2018 is absolutely working, because our market share continued to be very healthy. We\u2019re growing share across most categories, but at the same time now, we have a much improved gross margin, which was absolutely our strategic intention, when we had the pricing intervention in 2018.","And lastly, regarding Younique. And Younique trends have improved in this last quarter, but from a profit point of view, we were disappointed by the results because what happened is, we did implement new compensation plan adjustments, and it takes time to for the presenters to adapt to their behavior and clearly have an impact presenter recruitment through the new compensation plan.","At the same time, while doing this, the new compensation plan is in place and clearing costing our money. Now to offset this, we have two programs, which are doing very well in Younique. One is the loyalty program, which is helping to increase retention of presenters, and the second one is a subscription program, which we launched just mid-August.","And in just a couple of months, we have more than 70,000 consumers that had subscribed to our new subscription program for mascara. And of course, these two programs give us also a lot of confidence for returning Younique to a very strong performance in the coming quarters, because of course, they do improve the loyalty and predictability of the business overtime.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good morning everybody. I guess couple of sort of housekeeping questions. So if you\u2019re going to get back much of the supply chain related disruptions to the top line, why not keep the sales targets that you had outlined in conjunction with fourth quarter results, and then sort of related to that, how do you think about given some of the challenges in Consumer Beauty that these supply chain disruptions don\u2019t have a more permanent impact on the business?","And then the same sort of comment on the Luxury business, so you say you\u2019re getting that back, but obviously this part of the year is a pretty key part of the year, and so why does that have more of an impact on the business?","And then just lastly, also somewhat related, given seasonality in the business and the profitability, cash flows in the first half of the year, is part of the withdrawal of guidance in sort of talking about updates next quarter because basically this year is now a wash, as you consider that you can never get back to that level of profitability. So we\u2019re basically looking at fiscal 2020 now as kind of the first year out where results meet whatever your expectations would be?","Camillo Pane","Thanks, Mark. I\u2019ll try to answer all your questions in the order that you gave it to me. The first one is for the outlook of 2019. Of course, we are working very hard to contain the impact of the supply chain disruption for the first half. But there is potential for future impacts in the second half, and therefore we have limited visibility to the overall impact on 2019 revenues and profits, and we want to take more time to have this assessment. And this is why we told you that we would like to come back next quarter.","Despite the headwinds, we continue to expect operating profit and margin improvement and growth in 2019, because we do see significant progress in fixed cost reductions, and we are delivering the synergies, and that\u2019s why we are just saying that we will come to the next quarter.","Now, when I look at the specific in the divisions, the first one, I think you ask is Luxury. It is true, true that we are entering into the highest season, and \u2013 but we do have a safety stock and it\u2019s not like that the supply chain headwinds that we\u2019re having will stop us from having a strong season, and this is why we have reaffirmed that we will grow revenues and the profits in Q2 in Luxury, and of course we believe in the underlying strong demand for the Luxury business.","And of course, we got impacted by the headwinds and the hurricanes of both internal and external and the component shortages, but the underlying demand is strong, and we believe we\u2019ll be able to deliver on our outlook. In Consumer Beauty, as I said, the supply chain really impacted the Rimmel and Max Factor. So it is different and this is a mix of supply chain issues and underlying performance of our business, and I\u2019ve mentioned a lot what are the actual plan that we are doing to turn around the Consumer Beauty.","We need to be focused absolutely on strengthening operational discipline in Consumer Beauty, that\u2019s our first focus, plus doing those other strategic changes that I mentioned, including reallocating the capital. Now, in terms of profitability, your last question was, I think I answered your last question in terms of why we are not giving guidance, and we\u2019re going to wait one more quarter, because we understand the profit. And it\u2019s the same for cash flow at the end of the day.","So the two things are related, they are very much interlinked. So we do expect positive free cash flow in the next three quarters and report positive free cash flow in 2019, but because of the impacts, we want to wait to give you a specific level of details, and we will do it in the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","Yes, hi, good morning. So just two questions from me. One is on the ALMEA performance within Consumer Beauty. So Camillo, I\u2019d love your take on was that in line with expectations, because it seems to me that, that business may have decelerated a little bit, and if you could just focus your comment sort of outside of Brazil?","And then my second question is just around, like I understand the specific supply chain issues, but it seems to me that since the P&G acquisitions, there have been a number of like integration-related distraction, so I wonder if you put any new like internal processes, changes anything like, is there a specific team that\u2019s now going to be responsible for some of these execution, integration actions, because it seems to me that there\u2019s been a lot of focus on just synergy realization, and perhaps less so on just the execution.","And I understand that you\u2019ve delayed some of these, you\u2019ve modified your plans and delayed some of this transition, but how do we know that when you do go forward with these consolidation plans, you\u2019re not going to encounter sort of similar issues? So just would love your perspective on both of the things. Thanks.","Camillo Pane","Thanks, Faiza. Looking at ALMEA, I think I mentioned Brazil, quite extensively. So we\u2019re very pleased with that. Look the \u2013 actually the driver of the ALMEA was moderately positive, so we grew in ALMEA in Consumer Beauty in the quarter, and with a couple of different dynamics, Brazil was very good as I mentioned, Mexico was also very good, we continue to grow our share, especially in hair color which in Wella, which remains our stronger brand there.","And we believe, also we had very good growth there, we had Bourjois which is the number one color cosmetic brand in Middle East, and we\u2019re doing a lot of very strong things there. And also we grew in China, but the China, we had a deceleration of growth, but we are not \u2013 we continue to remain confident on our business in China. I think the overall health of our Chinese business across all divisions actually is very strong, and we have the size there that allow us for a lot of opportunities in the future.","One of the countries which slow in down in ALMEA, which is actually very sizable country for us is Australia. This is where \u2013 Australia performed very, very well in 2018, but Q1 of 2019, I think some executional issues didn\u2019t allow Australia to grow and in the contrary, we had a decline there, and Australia is actually quite sizable for us, so it\u2019s driving down the performance of ALMEA and Consumer Beauty.","We believe this is temporary because we have high level of confidence on the health and the potential for continued growth, healthy growth in ALMEA in Consumer Beauty, as we mentioned in our earnings model, and also in our previous call in August.","Looking at the supply chain integration disruption, I think what is important is first to really remind that what we\u2019re trying to build is really a streamlined, agile, very strong supply organization, which will be really give us the foundation for best in class operational efficiency.","So we are always going to keep in mind the complexity and the ambition of the journey and the fact that I\u2019m still having these last three internal issues that I mentioned in the call, we really did a lot of complex integration things without having any issue.","Now looking at the current issue, the three headwinds that we have in Q1, absolutely, we are reviewing the entire planning process of the company to make it a much stronger and more robust and fit for an organization that has many new people, because we do forget that we have also many new people they came from the outside because we had to send out some of the organization during the merger. Now with this, where we are right now is that we have done 80% of the integration.","So it\u2019s a quite a large platform and for the remaining 20% as you mentioned we have decided to do some modification, and to de-risk some of the consolidation. Based on the new brands, we\u2019re actually confident that we\u2019re going to create the integration of fiscal 2019, with a much lower level of risk.","And regarding your question about the specific teams, we do, yes have specific teams that now are in \u2013 clearly looking at this planning process and the consolidation plan with the level of details and scrutiny that clearly we have never had before.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Olivia Tong of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Q - Olivia Tong","Thanks. First just a clarification in terms of your supply chain issues, and I am a bit confused on how \u2013 you have all the supply chain issues that have cropped up more recently. You\u2019re delaying some of the consolidation in terms of the manufacturing, you are drawing some of the consolidation, yet, it doesn\u2019t impact the delivery of synergies. Why is that the case?","Camillo Pane","Thanks Olivia for the question, because, first of all, as we said, we\u2019ve done 80%, it\u2019s remaining 20%. Out of the remaining 20%, the one that we have the risk they were mostly driving simplification and rather than having a lot of cost savings attached to it.","Not every single project has a large cost saving attached to it, but many of the projects are supply certification for us, but also for our customers, because we are trying to achieve what we call internally 111, which is one order, one invoice, and one distribution points \u2013 one shipment point, and so because of the basically that\u2019s the answer to your question. It\u2019s the simplification, the growth there that is driving some of these plans and the impact on synergies is truly minimal and it completely gets absorbed by the older problems that we are absolutely delivering on target.","Q - Olivia Tong","Got it. And if I could just follow up with two more unrelated, I know you lot of challenge fragrance brands and made a lot of portfolio changes, but does there need to be more pairing back of the portfolio to get to where you want to get to, and then just one housekeeping, if you could help us in terms of your updated expectations on full year net interest expense and tax rate. Thank you.","Camillo Pane","Olivia, can I ask you to repeat the question, because, you\u2019re \u2013 unfortunately your line is not the best, I couldn\u2019t hear you very well. Can you repeat again?","Q - Olivia Tong","Okay. I\u2019ll just pick up my phone. But, the first one was just around your portfolio because I know you\u2019ve obviously gotten rid of quite a few of the challenge fragrance brands but does there need to be more pairing back of the portfolio in order to get to where you want to get to? And then just a housekeeping one was around your updated expectations for the full year on interest expense and tax rate.","Camillo Pane","Okay. So on the portfolio, I think we have done our portfolio rationalization, as you mentioned we have turned back some of the fragrance brand and we don\u2019t expect to have any more rationalization at this point. We\u2019re happy with our portfolio and our focus is absolutely to drive, to continue to drive strong growth from Luxury and Professional Beauty and the thought was clearly is to turnaround the Consumer Beauty with the actual plan that I mentioned before.","And so in terms of interest rates and tax rate, so the first one is, from a tax rate, we expect in the low 2020\u2019s around the 22%. So that\u2019s our estimate we have given at the beginning, in the last earnings call and we continue to be committed to this. And in terms of interest expense, we\u2019re pulling in more than around $310 million.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Steph Wissink of Jefferies.","Q - Steph Wissink","Thanks, good morning everyone. I want to come back to Mark\u2019s earlier question on the guidance and the just the past line or the track line here. In your second quarter, Camilla you\u2019re expecting Lux and Pro to return to positive and I think you mentioned down high single-digits in consumer.","Can you just help us bridge the transition from Q1 to Q2 on what\u2019s remediation of supply chain versus what your expectations are for underlying improvement and then also update us on any shelf space changes or adjustments to your planned promotions or programs and any impact from the supply chain. Thank you.","Camillo Pane","Yeah. So from a guidance point of view, yes, you\u2019re correct. So we expect the Luxury and Professional Beauty to go back to more or less approximately the same trend that we had in 2018 basically to revert to growth because the supply chain headwinds will abate although we will still have some supply chain headwinds in Q2, but we believe that our underlying strong demand will be able to offset that one and we are confident with that.","And Consumer Beauty is, we\u2019re seeing about higher single-digit decline, this is driven by, first of all the \u2013 the resolution or the improvement of the supply chain headwinds, which of course will benefit Consumer Beauty as well from a service level point of view, plus we are putting in place this action that I mentioned before and one important one is clearly a much stronger management for our trade spending and gross-to-net. As you could imagine gross-to-net was \u2013 as I mentioned before, impacted by the penalties for the customers were impacted by all these additional promotional activities.","Once the supply chain headwinds will abate, we will be able to manage better the spending and then of course we\u2019ll have a positive impact on the revenue decline and there of course is staying higher [indiscernible] Consumer Beauty that I mentioned before, so the operational discipline, the reallocation of investments, the stronger growth of e-commerce that I mentioned before and all these will be \u2013 will also benefit from a lesser headwinds on supply chain.","I don\u2019t think we should underestimate the impact on the commercial organization from supply chain headwinds of the nature they we\u2019d be dealing with and this will reverse will improve in Q2 \u2013 will eventually reverse in the second half of 2019.","Regarding your second question, which I think was about shelf space, I want to go back to what I said in the last earnings call, because so first of all, our focus is on driving consumption productivity on shelf and one thing that I want to say, which is positive is the fact that we have seen actually positive progression in productivity and innovation performance especially in CoverGirl, but also in Rimmel in the U.S.","CoverGirl productivity, if we exclude the distribution losses actually have been improving and growing across most of the customers in the U.S. for practically four months in a row. And this is really, really positive. Now this productivity growth is a very good news, and it shows that the brand is reacting to all the problems that we\u2019re putting behind it and for the relaunch, but this productivity growth is still insufficient to offset the distribution headwinds and this is why we have already flagged that distribution headwinds will continue in the remaining of the year and also in the second half of 2019 whether it will be the shelf reset by most of the retailers.","And our objective is truly to continue increasing the productivity in our brands, that\u2019s the way that we are going to at some point of course stop this distribution losses and stabilize our business in North America. I\u2019m course reassured that by what I\u2019m seeing in CoverGirl and Rimmel, but there is a lot of, more work to do. I think one of the problem that I want to mention is the Cruelty Free, so this \u2013 the certification by Cruelty Free International that we received for CoverGirl, tons of work has gone behind it, because we had a full external audit of our supply chain including all our suppliers in order to obtain this certification.","So this is truly the gold standard in Cruelty Free certification, and we are also committed to regular audits every year, which again is another sign of strict control and commitment to this, and we also are committed to have another brand that will become certified by CFI that will be international by the fiscal 2020.","The reaction of the customers to this new certification claim has been really, really positive. So we\u2019re encouraged by this, of course we just announced it just few days ago, but it\u2019s another program that we believe will help CoverGirl to return, of course, to continue to be the top leader in color cosmetics in the U.S., but also to return much better performance.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky","Thanks. I was hoping if you could talk to your free cash flow and how much you think the supply chain issues impacted your working capital in the quarter and then thinking about free cash flow for the full year, I guess, how confident are you in getting growth in free cash flow, positive free cash flow for the full year and then considering the challenges facing you regarding cash flow and your need to focus on deleveraging, how committed are you to the dividend?","Camillo Pane","So, thanks, Joe. I think the first question is about the free cash flow, yeah, the impact on the net working capital from the supply chain is actually quite severe. If you think about it, we\u2019ve managed better with inventories, but at the same time we got to restore stock because our service levels got hit by the supply headwinds, that\u2019s a very difficult task for the teams to manage better the inventory when we\u2019re building new ones, so we were building safety stock.","Second one is on receivable. As you can imagine, improving our terms becomes more challenging for all our commercial teams when we are having a debate and discussions because of the service levels not being where it should be.","So without any doubt, the net working capital were hit severely by the supply chain headwinds, and consequentially the ability to deliver the free cash flow of course gets impacted. Now despite that, we are truly focusing the validation on cash, which is something that was not as pronounced strong in the past, especially during the first year or two of the iteration, and that\u2019s why we believe that we\u2019re going to have positive free cash flow in the remaining quarter and in the total year.","We are confident also because we\u2019re having, a big attention to our CapEx and to our one-off, although all these profit of course has started a while ago and we are focusing the organization much more on that and we even changed the incentive scheme of all our leaders to make sure the networking capital cash one-off and CapEx are now including in their incentive.","The dividend, I think you asked about the dividends. Well, the dividends is \u2013 well, my opinion is that we believe capital dividends sent a signal to the market that we have a terminal cash flow problem, which is absolutely not the case.","Our free cash flow, as I said should improve in the reminder of 2019 and also in 2020, we will have a material positive benefit by the fact that the CapEx and especially one-time cash costs will drop, will decrease significantly, and this is why I think it\u2019s important to underline that it\u2019s just a temporary problem and not a permanent one.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks very much. I just wanted to maybe follow up on the line of questioning earlier about I guess what gives you the confidence that the supply chain issues haven\u2019t really setback the sales process, especially as it relates to Consumer Beauty, you talked about that being contained to Q2 \u2013 and Q2 maybe Q3, but can you talk to me about what retailer feedback has been and how do you go about positioning like this execution issue and convincing people that it\u2019s not something that are going, even though you have the great analytics and the products performing on shelf, how do you get the retailer comfortable it\u2019s going to be there? Thanks.","Camillo Pane","I think it\u2019s a matter of \u2013 building strong partnership with the retailers. First of all, it\u2019s about transparency as well, I think we have been very transparent with the retailers explaining the type of issues we were dealing with, and doing in a very timely manner. The one that we knew that I already mentioned in the August call that were completely disclosed, of course to the retailers with a different timeline of returning it to proper service level and the one in Luxury that we had through the hurricane and through the late warehouse issues and to be honest, we went to the retailers and explained the situation because this was unexpected for us as well.","But at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about partnership, it\u2019s all about transparency, it\u2019s all about having strong programs to drive consumer demand. And, just going back in Luxury Professional Beauty, our consumer demand is very strong.","So of course it is incredibly frustrating for everybody for us and for the retailers, for the customers, but they do know that our customer demand is strong and if we show them plans of restoring service level in the next two, three months, retailers do understand that. We\u2019ve build together plans on how we deal with the shortages, and we readjust the promotional plans or the launch plans in a way that to get \u2013 taking consideration of the headwinds.","In Consumer Beauty it\u2019s clearly more difficult because this is a mix between the supply issues, but also the fact that some of the brands are not performing where they are, and this is why we do better in the prominent reporting that took place in the execution of innovation in the discipline that I mentioned before and there is absolutely a big, big focus and priority for me and for the Consumer Beauty absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser of DA Davidson.","Linda Bolton-Weiser","Hi. So, I was curious if you could just update us on the CFO search and how that \u2013 how\u2019s that going, and also how is the morale in the company because you\u2019ve brought in a lot of new executives anyways, and then you have these issues developing. So how is the morale in the company? Thanks.","Camillo Pane","Yes. So, look CFO search what I can update you is that we had a lot of very strong candidates that we\u2019ve been evaluating and we are between the middle and toward the end of our selection processes. So we\u2019ll be able to update you soon on this one, but we are pleased with the quality of the candidates, that very high level of interest into our journey, and a lot of candidates really with very strong background, very strict with our needs in our journey.","In terms of morale, it\u2019s a different situation to be crystal clear, because in Luxury and Professional Beauty, we do have two very high performing business, beating the market growth rate and beating expectations. In Consumer Beauty we do have clearly a mixed morale, because of course the performance have not been, I would say close to the expectation now for a while, but this is something that we are working with the leaders.","I mean, yes, we do have a new leadership team that is quite recent, or quite new into Consumer Beauty. We continue to drive for the right cultural fit and the right skills to perform the turnaround and when I look at the morale and one of the things that we have done is that we have changed the vesting period of some of the our \u2013 of our LTI program to progress investing within three, four and five years, which I think it will also help with the retention of key talent.","So overall, what is important is that we do focus on the turnaround of Consumer Beauty which remains our priority and there is a huge belief in the company and our partners and our long-term journey. And this is also very, very reassuring for me and for my colleagues in that. We continue to see very, very high level of loyalty and belief in our journey because everybody is aware that these are temporary headwinds that we\u2019re dealing with, within a very complex integration, but the benefits of the new Coty and the value that we\u2019re creating for the future is absolutely not in doubt.","Operator","Thank you.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty\u2019s Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, you may proceed.","Kevin Monaco","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call are Michele Scannavini, Chief Executive Officer, and Sergio Perdreiro, Chief Financial Officer. ","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements.

You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I will now turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Scannavini","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to welcome all of you to our first financial results conference call as a public company following the listing of our shares on the New York Stock Exchange this past June. We enjoyed meeting with many of you throughout the IPO process and we look forward to updating you on our performance as well as how we are progressing with our business strategy. Since there may be some of you who are new to the Coty story, I\u2019ll provide a brief overview of who we are, highlights of our unique attributes, and applying our strategic priorities for driving profitable growth. ","Coty is a new emerging leader in beauty. We have delivered sustained revenue growth and margin expansion over the last 10 years thanks to our ability to build and develop a brand, proposing and changing innovation to the market, coupled with strong discipline in controlling our operating costs. We have a portfolio of well-known and successful brands that hold leading positions in three segments: fragrances, color cosmetic, and skin and body care. Our brands compete in most key distribution channels across the prestige and mass markets and in more than 130 countries and territories.","Our growth is driven predominantly by our power brands, which are our top 10 brands and represent approximately 70% of our net revenues. We have power brands in all the segments where we compete. Five power brands are in fragrances: Calvin Klein, Marc Jacobs, Davidoff, Playboy, and Chloe; three are in color cosmetics: Rimmel, Sally Hansen, and OPI; and two are in skin and body care: Adidas and Philosophy. They are spread our three segments, are globally recognized, and are important contributors to our results.","Our strategy of profitable growth revolves around six key drivers: first, maximizing the growth potential of our power brands with a focus on superior innovation. Our second key driver is further strengthening our position in our core fragrances and core cosmetic segments while expanding our presence in skin and body care. Third, we aim at increasing our global coverage by accelerating our growth in emerging markets. We are targeting to grow the share of our business in emerging markets from the current one quarter on the revenues to more than one third in five years\u2019 time.","Our fourth driver is leveraging our multi-channel distribution strategy to capture growth across all price points and reaching a vast and diverse spectrum of potential consumers. Fifth driver is continuing to expand our margin by further increasing our supply chain productivity and focusing on disciplined fixed cost management; and finally, continuing to generate substantial amounts of cash through improved earnings and working capital reduction. ","Leveraging the six drivers I just discussed, we expect to achieve our long-term financial targets, which are growing net revenues in line or faster than the markets and segments where we compete, growing earnings faster than revenues, keep expanding margins, continuing to generate strong cash flow, increasing working capital efficiency. ","In addition to these six drivers for organic growth, we will continue to actively evaluate external opportunities to further increase our competitiveness. Historically, this has been a key contributor toward Coty\u2019s strong development and an important generator of shareholder value. ","Having laid out the structure of our long-term strategy, let me now provide you with an update on our quarterly and year-end financial results, which Sergio will review in more detail a bit later. Fiscal year \u201913 was another positive year for Coty with solid financial results. Our adjusted operating income grew 7%, thanks to growth in revenues and discipline in our operational costs. Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 12.3% of net revenues. Our adjusted net earnings also increased 7%, bringing our EPS to $0.82 from $0.78 last year. ","We were able to once again generate strong cash converting more than 100% of our operating earnings into cash. Net revenues grew 2% like-for-like. We grew in all the regions and in our largest segments, fragrance and color. We are targeting to progressively recover a higher growth rate in line with our long-term targets as our new program of growth acceleration in emerging markets starts to have an impact and as we get traction in skin and body care.","Let\u2019s now analyze in more detail our performance in the fourth quarter and in the total fiscal year. Net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2013 increased by 4% on a like-for-like basis driven by strong performance in fragrances and skin and body care, as well as accelerated growth in emerging market regions. Full fiscal year 2013 revenues were up 2% on a like-for-like basis due to strength in fragrances and color cosmetics, along with higher net revenues in all the regions. ","Fragrances, which represented 54% of our total net revenues this past year grew 6% in the fourth quarter and 3% in the year outpacing market trends. Strong contributors to the growth in the quarter and the total year were our power brands, Marc Jacobs, Chloe and Playboy. Marc Jacobs grew in the double digits for the fourth year in a row. This remarkable performance is directly linked to the outstanding creativity of the product esthetic and positioning. Marc Jacobs DOT was one of the most successful fragrance launches of the year in several countries, including the U.S. and the U.K. Chloe is steadily gaining market share globally year after year. After only five years from the initial launch, the Chloe brand is among the top 20 female brand worldwide with positional strength in U.S., Europe, and Asia. ","Relevant contribution to the development of our fragrance segment also came from some of our regional brands, like Roberto Cavalli, particularly strong in emerging countries as Middle East, Russia, and Europe. Finally, the Lady Gaga launch recently did particularly well with young consumers and added to our revenues, thanks also to a multi-channel distribution strategy, making the product available to consumers that are shopping in different channels, both off and online.","Calvin Klein, after a robust growth in fiscal year 2012 coming from strong innovations, faced some challenges in the consolidated markets, particularly in southern Europe; however, we are pleased to see the brand continuing to progress at a fast pace in emerging markets. In China, as an example, Calvin Klein grew 28% in fiscal year 2013, leveraging the strong awareness and image of the brand in that country.","Color cosmetics, which represented 31% of our business in fiscal 2013, grew 4% in the year and was stable in the fourth quarter. The star performer of the year was Rimmel, our biggest brand in the segment, which delivered double-digit growth gaining market share in Europe and in the U.S. The success of the brand traces to an outstanding innovation program which offers a steady stream of surprising new product concepts to consumer as was the case this year with Apocalips Lip Lacquer. The success of the brand is also due to a competitive price positioning with a cutting edge marketing mix, including an extremely creative and engaging digital program. ","Sally Hansen, after a strong start in the year, had more challenges in the second half, ending stable for the year overall. The nail category has seen unprecedented competitive activity with several new brands joining the nail arena and investment increasing significantly. At the same time, consumption growth is going down, resulting in destocking activity by retailers which impacted Sally Hansen in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 and the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. We are working to ensure Sally Hansen can defend its undisputed leadership in the U.S. market while continuing to expand internationally."," ","OPI was also stable in the year after an outstanding 21% pro forma growth last year. ","Skin and body care, 15% of our business in fiscal year \u201913, represents an important opportunity for future growth. Two years ago, we created a global platform to start building the segment with the acquisition of TJoy and Philosophy. TJoy is a Chinese brand that provides us with the operating platform to produce, distribute and sell Coty products in the mass channel in China. Philosophy is a unique American brand with a strong driver to consumer business and potential for expansion outside the U.S. Those two brands together with existing Adidas and Lancaster brands will provide us with the tools to start growing our presence in this segment, which is the biggest segment in beauty, and to facilitate our penetration in emerging markets, particularly Asia.","We are working to develop and execute a growth roadmap for each of the brands in the segment. Work is in progress and we are encouraged to see positive performance in Q4 with skin and body care revenues growing 6% versus the previous year. The total year, however, still showed a 4% decline and it will take some time still before seeing sustained growth in the segment. ","Adidas, our biggest brand in the segment, decreased marginally in the year due to the challenging market conditions in Europe, which is still the core region for the brand. This was partially compensated by growth in the U.S. and China, leveraging TJoy distribution and selling capabilities. In fiscal year \u201913, Adidas was our biggest brand in China and we see clear potential for further development of Adidas in emerging markets. ","Philosophy is progressively regaining traction. While the total year showed a marginal decline, we progressively recovered momentum in the second half, and in the fourth quarter we showed revenue increases versus the prior year as our innovation program and international expansion started to kick in. ","From a geographic perspective, we have seen a certain slowdown of global market growth in the first part of this calendar year to about 3%, or about 1.5% for the geographies and segments Coty is exposed to. Europe was marginally recessive due to the soft consumption dynamic and an increasingly promotional environment, particularly in southern Europe and the U.K. In the U.S. after a strong start to the year, the market suffered from unexpected deceleration of growth in the last quarter and most recently, particularly in the mass segment. Emerging markets still have healthy growth, which we estimate between 5 and 6%. ","In these market contexts, we achieved higher net revenues in all three of our regions during fiscal year 2013 \u2013 the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. In the fourth quarter 2013, the Asia Pacific region saw double digit increases while EMEA returned to growth thanks to strong performance in Russia, Middle East, U.K., and (indiscernible). Americas were flat in quarter four with good growth in Latin America compensating for a marginal decline in the U.S. Developed markets were up 1% in 2013 and 2% in the fourth quarter, while emerging markets were up 6% total year and 8% in the fourth quarter. Emerging markets represented 24% of our total net revenues in the year compared to 23% last year. In the fourth quarter, this percentage went up to 25%, confirming that our increased focus on emerging markets is yielding results and encouraging us to keep pursuing our five-year target of developing at least one-third of our total business in those markets, a core area we have targeted for growth.","As part of our growth plan, in the fourth quarter we announced two moves which will further strengthen our structure to reach new consumers in new markets. To increase our penetration in Asia we acquired StarAsia, an established distributor of beauty products in southeast Asia, to sell Coty products in the mass retail channel in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore. We already have a successful joint venture in southeast Asia for our prestige brands and we are confident that this new structure will enable us to achieve similar successful development in the mass market.","In Brazil, we formed a joint venture with Frajo International, a subsidiary of O Boticario, a leading Brazilian cosmetic retailer, to expand the retail distribution platform for Coty mass and masstige beauty products in Brazil. The new structure will be operational starting in the second quarter of fiscal year \u201914 and will focus initially on Adidas, Playboy, and masstige fragrances. This, coupled with our commercial partnership with door-to-door vendor, Jequiti, will enable us to progressively build our business in the Brazilian market, which is currently the number two beauty market worldwide. ","Innovation has always been the engine of our growth, and in fiscal year \u201913 we confirmed our ability to bring to the industry innovation that stands out for its creativity and is about changing consumer perspective and attitudes on products. Highlights of the year were: in fragrance Dot Marc Jacobs, which represented a disruptive approach to fragrance packaging and esthetics, and Lady Gaga, the first black to clear juice; in color, it\u2019s worth mentioning the new nail gel technology from Sally Hansen and the revolutionary Lip Lacquer in Rimmel; and in skin, the new infrared technology in Lancaster, allowing the best protection against damages from sun rays.","Our focus on innovation will be unchanged in fiscal year \u201914. Among the several innovations that will hit the shelves in the first half worth mentioning: in fragrance, we launched in August HONEY Marc Jacobs, another unique creation which is off to a very strong start in the U.S. and the U.K. As we speak, we are also launching Downtown, the new Calvin Klein fragrance featuring Rooney Mara; Killer Queen, the first Katy Perry fragrance launched since she joined Coty; and Super Playboy, the new boudoir fragrances for him and for her. ","In color in Q2, we will launch Sally Hansen Triple Shine, a new formula that incorporates our exclusive shield complex for ultimate shining colors, with strong media and in-store support. Rimmel will propose a new look inspired by the 60\u2019s with the new Scandalize mascara. ","In skin, we are launching now in exclusivity with one U.S. retailer the new Philosophy Time in a Bottle, a new anti-aging serum which will be rolled out to full distribution later in the year. In Adidas, we renew (indiscernible) in Q2. ","Innovation is the engine that will continue to differentiate us and drive our growth. This, along with the strength of our power brands, continued expansion in emerging markets, and the opportunities provided by our multi-channel strategy will help us achieve our long-term goal of growing in line or better than the industry average in the segments and geographic regions in which we operate.","Looking at the beginning of fiscal year 2014, we have seen a deceleration of market growth over the last few months in the U.S. and Europe triggering significant destocking activity, particularly by U.S. mass retailers. Inventory reduction in the U.S. mass market is occurring across most of our top customers and across all product segments. As a consequence, we estimate net revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 to be marginally lower than last year. We are expecting to return over the second half of the fiscal year to our long-term target of growing in line or faster than the markets and the segments where we compete as the inventory situation normalizes and as we start benefiting from the first impact of our new investments in emerging markets, particularly in Asia and Brazil. At this stage, we need more visibility into the back-to-school and Christmas season to assess if and how our long-term and earnings targets will be affected in the year by the consumption slowdown and trade destocking of the recent months. We will give an update on the evolution of the situation on the next call in two months from now.","I would now like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sergio Perdreiro, who will review our financial results in more detail. Sergio?","Sergio Perdreiro","Thank you, Michele, and good morning everyone. First, I\u2019d like to remind all of you that my commentary today on our results and outlook includes a discussion of adjusted results, which exclude the impact of non-recurring items, private company share-based compensation, and restructuring costs. When applicable, I will also discuss our adjusted results at constant currency. This presentation is consistent with how we plan to report results and provide our outlook in future quarters. You can find the bridge from reported to adjusted results, including foreign exchange translation impact, in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","For full fiscal year 2013, net revenues increased 2% on a like-for-like basis. This improvement was due to a good performance in color and fragrance, and from a geographic point of view growth in all three regions and stronger growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas. In the fourth quarter, net revenues increased 4% on a like-for-like basis. We are pleased with this performance as it was achieved in spite of challenging market conditions, in particular in the mass channel, as Michele just explained.","Growth was driven by strong performance in Asia Pacific with double-digit growth at constant currency. We also achieved remarkable mid single-digit growth in EMEA despite a recessive market situation in western Europe. This was driven by strong performance in the emerging markets of Russia and the Middle East and solid growth in (indiscernible). In the Americas, revenues were in line with prior year thanks to strong growth in Latin America offset by a slight decline in North American business. This was due to the first impact of retailers\u2019 inventory reduction as a reaction to traffic and consumption slowdowns, particularly in the mass channel.","For 2013, gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 60% versus 60.4% in the previous year. We continue to benefit from our efficiency program in supply chain, mainly driven by factors of productivity and worldwide procurement. The savings coming from supply chain were more than offset by increased discounting activity needed to compete in the highly promotional European market. ","Adjusted net income in 2013 increased 7% to $323.2 million versus $300.7 million in 2012, primarily driven by higher operating income. This resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.82. For the fourth quarter, adjusted net income was $9.9 million versus a loss of $2.3 million in the comparable 2012 period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.03.","On a reported basis, net income for 2013 increased to $168 million versus a loss of $324.4 million in 2012. This increase was primarily driven by higher operating income along with lower interest expense, partially offset by higher tax expenses due to the mix of business. Our adjusted operating income increased 8% on a constant currency basis to $576.3 million in 2013 compared $535.9 million in 2012. Adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 12.3% of net revenue as compared to 11.6% last year. The increase was primarily the result of lower selling, general and administrative expenses which as a percent of net revenue declined by 110 basis points to 45.7%. The decrease in SG&A was primarily driven by 60 basis points lower fixed costs, including lower variable compensation.","Spending on advertising and consumer promotion was flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis and decreased by 1% on actual rates. As a percentage of net revenues, A&CP was 23.1% compared to 23.5% in the previous year. This 40 basis point decrease includes approximately a 20 basis point reduction resulting from savings realized in vendor negotiations. The balance of the decrease in advertising and consumer promotion reflects a shift in promotional expense towards customer discounts and allowances, driven by our mass retail business especially in southern Europe and the U.K.","Reported operating income increased to $394.4 million in 2013 from an operating loss of $209.5 million in fiscal 2012. This increase of $603.9 million was due primarily to lower asset impairment charges of $1.5 million compared to $575.9 million in fiscal 2012. In addition, the increase in reported operating income was driven by lower SG&A, the gain on sale of assets, and lower amortization expense. This improvement was slightly offset by higher cost of sales and restructuring expenses.","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, adjusted operating income was $45.4 million, up approximately $30 million versus $11.6 million in the comparable 2012 period. On a reported basis, we had an operating loss of $23.9 million in the quarter due to $26.3 million of restructuring expenses versus a loss of $485.4 million in the last quarter of 2012, driven by asset impairment charges of $473.9 million. ","By segment, our fiscal year \u201913 adjusted operating margin in fragrance improved by 90 basis points to 14.8%, and color cosmetics operating margins were also up 20 basis points to 14.2%. Our skin and body care business is approximately break-even with an adjusted operating margin of minus 0.8% in 2013. As you know, skin and body care is our smallest segment, accounting for 15% of our net revenues, and we anticipate gradual operating margin improvement in this segment in the years to come as we progressively grow scale.","During the fourth quarter, we completed the transition phase to our new logistics service provider covering the prestige business in Europe and Asia. In the fourth quarter, shipments were completely normalized and we ended the fiscal year with no orders on backlog. Also during the fourth quarter, we approved and launched a new productivity plan, including a number of initiatives designed to enhance our long-term operating margins. The productivity plan includes actions to gain efficiencies in our operating model in skin and body care along with certain commercial organization redesign activities primarily in Europe, productivity programs across our supply chain, and optimization of selected support functions. As part of this program, Philosophy\u2019s commercial marketing and R&D teams are currently being relocated to New York and integrated into our Coty U.S. team.","The total charge associated with the program is expected to be approximately $70 million to $75 million in the course of the next 24 to 36 months. We recorded charges of $25.3 million in fiscal 2013. Savings associated with the program are expected to gradually increase to an annualized level of $40 million to $45 million once the program is completed by fiscal 2016.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was 28.2% in fiscal 2013 compared to 27.7% in the prior year. This increase in effective tax rate was driven by a change in jurisdictional mix with higher profits in countries with higher tax rates. Going forward, we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to remain in the range of 28% plus or minus 3%. On a cash tax basis, we expect to continue to benefit from historical net operating losses in the U.S. and Germany, as well as from the tax deductibility of goodwill amortization for OPI and Philosophy, resulting in a long-term sustainable cash tax rate in the range of 18% plus or minus 3%. In fiscal year 2013, cash paid for income taxes was 16.9% of adjusted income before income taxes. ","Fiscal 2013 was another year of strong cash flow generation. Net cash provided by operating activities, excluding cash used for private company stock option exercises, was $618.4 million in 2013 compared to $593.3 million in 2012. This was equivalent to a cash conversion ratio of 108%. We continue to generate significant cash from operations through improved operating performance and a continued focus on working capital.","In 2013, our free cash flow, excluding cash used for private company stock option exercises, was $394.5 million or 8.5% of net revenues, which represents approximately 6.3% free cash flow yield and compares very favorably with the industry average. I am also pleased to communicate that we have raised our dividends to $0.20 per share. This reflects strong earnings and cash flow in fiscal 2013 and in the absence of any imminent acquisitions, we are raising our dividend per share by 33%. Going forward as we evaluate future dividends, we will always consider our financial condition and result of operations as well as availability of funds and capital requirements, including potential acquisitions.","As we enter fiscal 2014, we are facing the impact of trade destocking in the U.S. and increasing promotional activity in Europe. As Michele explained, these recent market developments are impacting our mass business and total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Also, we are currently facing FX headwinds and based on most recent exchange rates, the full-year impact in earnings would be in the range of 3 to 4%. This FX impact is driven primarily by double-digit depreciation of some currencies like the Australian dollar and the Russian ruble, as well as by depreciation of the British pound vis-\u00e0-vis the euro. ","As the back-to-school and the holiday seasons unfold, we will consolidate our outlook for the total fiscal year. Cash flow continues to be a strong focus for our organization. As we continue to gain efficiencies on working capital, we are creating the basis for another year of strong cash flow generation in fiscal 2014. ","We would now like to turn it back to the operator for questions. Operator?","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong, representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about your category growth expectations for mass versus prestige, and then for your business specifically, where do you expect to source most of your market share gains as the year progresses? Do you think it\u2019s going to come more in mass or prestige? Thanks.","Michele Scannavini","Okay, so good morning first of all, Olivia. Thanks for the question. Let me say that what we are seeing now is clearly a trend on the market that shows slower development in Mass versus Prestige. This is true in the U.S., and this is also true in Europe. Now, this is not something that we can anticipate is going to be a long-term trend. We have seen in the past that trend changing depending on the different years or season, mass having advantage versus prestige and prestige having advantage versus mass. So the situations like now, it happened sometimes in the past that in a certain market situation, people with lower income are more cautious in spending than people with higher income, but it\u2019s also true that for instance in 2009, in the big crisis, mass was pretty much resilient and in fact prestige had the much serious hit.","So looking forward, I should say I don\u2019t see a change in the current trend in the next few months, but longer term I don\u2019t think there is anything that can say that prestige is going to grow faster than mass.","As far as our market share, clearly we are working and developing plans to defend and increase our market share in all the different segments where we compete, being in the prestige channel or the mass channel, so we are not really defining a priority between the two but we try to maximize our competitiveness in both.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, thanks. And then can you parse out how much of the deceleration that you see in Q1, how much of that is destocking versus the underlying category deceleration in the U.S. and Europe?","Michele Scannavini","Look, those two are phenomena that is a bit difficult to separate one from the other. Now, obviously everything started with the deceleration of the market growth. When we talk of U.S., for instance, that is where we see the most important destocking activity. We have clearly seen a deceleration of the market growth in the three categories where we compete \u2013 fragrance prestige, fragrance mass, and color, particularly in the nail segment. This happened in the last quarter of last year and in the first couple months of this year.","Now, this is the trigger event for the trader to readjust the stock levels on the consumption level and growth, so I must say that when we look at the first two months of our quarter, that destocking has impacted quite significantly. We calculated within the first month a destocking impact of around $23 million to $25 million on our net revenues in the U.S., clearly progressively we expect the selling to get more in line with the consumption; in other words, to see the adjustment of the inventory to have an end once the inventories are more realigned with growth trend of the different categories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz, representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning. Can you just talk about first the margin trends in the quarter, both growth and operating margin\u2014or SG&A rather, because the 230 basis points decline in gross margin, kind of what drove that, and what the outlook is going forward. And then it looks like SG&A came down significantly in the quarter \u2013 it was down over 500 basis points year-over-year, maybe some of the drivers there and how sustainable some of those reductions are. And then I have a follow-up, please.","Sergio Perdreiro","Hi Bill. You\u2019re right \u2013 the gross margin came down 230 basis points. This was a combination of two effects. There is about 50 basis points that is fiscal year 2012 reclassification of an expense that was actually catching up for the full year, so it amounted for 50 basis points for that quarter but was actually adjusting adjusted for the full year. The balance of 180 basis points was the impact of higher discounts and allowances, as we discussed.","Now when you look at the SG&A, it came down significantly reflecting two developments. One is on the marketing expense that came down 250 basis points, a little bit less than half of the decrease in SG&A. I just want to call your attention to the fact that it\u2019s coming down from a very high base. It was actually 28.2% of net sales in the last quarter of previous year, and even after these reductions it\u2019s still at a very good level of 25.7%. ","The balance came from the other SG&A, including a reduction of 160 basis points that is equivalent to lower variable compensation. As you know, our compensation is very geared and is driven through results, and therefore with the performance you have a reflection in the size of the variable compensation which amounted, as I said, to 160 basis points in the last quarter.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thanks very much. And then the follow-up \u2013 how are you guys viewing the holiday? How are retailers getting ready for the season, because I know you said there\u2019s a bunch of destocking that kind of started and that went through this summer, but typically now is when you start thinking about and shipping products for the holiday season, so is it your customers\u2019 view that it\u2019s going to be a good Christmas, a bad Christmas, an average Christmas, and how are they allocating inventory accordingly?","Michele Scannavini","Well generally speaking, the retailers are cautious. They are still projecting Christmas to be up versus last year. So far, we didn\u2019t see any reduction in orders for what was planned for Christmas; rather, some retailers are postponing the shipments because I believe they want to have a bit more visibility on the back-to-school season. But so far, we have not been announced any significant material reduction of orders for the Christmas season."," ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Lesches, representing Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Joe Lesches \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, thanks. So in the U.S. mass channel, is the destocking concentrated at the biggest retailer, or has the trend spread to other U.S. mass retailers?","Michele Scannavini","It is concentrated on the top retailers. This is where we see the most important destocking activity. It is also what is impacting more our business in the first quarter.","Joe Lesches \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, and then the follow-up \u2013 it sounds like you are expecting trade inventory to normalize at some point in fiscal year 2014. I guess I just want to clarify that \u2013 are you expecting\u2014are you baking into your estimates some sort of a restocking boost, or is it essentially just an adjustment where sell-in meets sell-through, and when do you expect that to occur? I guess you\u2019re not expecting it in the first quarter. What gives you confidence that that essentially restocking will materialize?","Michele Scannavini","Look, obviously everything depends on the consumption development, so at the moment what\u2019s happening is that the retailers are adjusting their inventory to a lower consumption than expected. So as such, unless the consumption picks up faster, there\u2019s going to be an adjustment on the low side, but we are not anticipating any restocking. ","What remains to be assessed when these adjustments will be over, we have reason to believe that within the first half, inventory should be readjusted in the United States and in some European countries. Unless the consumption suffers a further slowdown, they should be at a normal level. Obviously, as I said, we need to have a little bit\u2014I think the retailers and we need to have a little bit more visibility on back-to-school and Christmas to confirm that these inventory adjustments are over by the end of the half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher, representing JP Morgan. Please proceed.","John Faucher \u2013 JP Morgan","Thank you. I guess this sort of flows into the last question. In terms of thinking about the sequential improvement from Q1 where you\u2019re guiding to down, to the back half where you\u2019re guiding to more in line with the long term algorithm, how should we think about that improvement? Are there underlying factors where even if the destocking continued, that you can expect some sort of sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2? And I guess this seems fairly obvious, but you only have a couple of weeks left in Q1, so I would assume you\u2019re feeling pretty comfortable in terms of the Q1 guidance, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be much that could sort of cause any consternation from that standpoint there. Is that the case? Thank you.","Michele Scannavini","Okay, so first part of your question, what makes us confident to progressively cover a better growth rate? So first of all, as I said before, with the visibility we have today, we estimate the destocking, at least the most important part of it, should be over in this first half. But apart from this and even though the destocking will be more severe than we anticipate, it will go longer than we anticipate, clearly we expect some impact on our growth by all the activities that we are doing to accelerate our development in emerging markets, and this is not only related to the latest two new ventures that we did in Brazil and in southeast Asia, that we start showing the benefit between the end of this fiscal but more material\u2014sorry, this first half, but more materially in the second half of the year, but also in the other emerging markets due to specific innovation plan, product line, and investments that we\u2019re going to do there to boost our business, and one example could be the Middle East, for instance.","So even though the situation in the consolidated market will be even gloomier than we see now, we have the boost of activity in emerging markets that progressively will bring our growth rate much more in line with our long-term targets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga, representing Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Just two related questions \u2013 Michele, could you give us a little bit more of a contextualization of the destocking issue in terms of sell-in versus sell-through? Kind of what the delta is there between those two different line items would be helpful to help contextualize this issue. And then relatedly into next year, in your fiscal 2014, we know we\u2019ve got the Downtown launch here in the first fiscal half for you. Will there be any other Calvin Klein or Marc Jacobs launches that we can look for in the back half, either on the male side of it, of the fragrance? That\u2019d be helpful, thanks.","Michele Scannavini","Okay, so coming back to the destocking phenomena, as I said before, we have calculated the impact on our revenues by the destocking in the first two months of quarter one to be around $23 million to $25 million. This is impacting particularly our color and nail businesses, so the brands that will be more impacted by this is Sally Hansen. On this, I can maybe help to understand what is going on, mentioning a couple of market data that I think is very telling.","When we talk in the nail category, as you know, the nail category had fantastic growth over the last two fiscal years, growth between 15 to 20%. In quarter three of this fiscal year, growth was still 11%, April plus-10.8%, May plus-11.7%, and then all of a sudden June plus 0.8%, July minus-2.5%. So you can easily picture the situation \u2013 we and the retailers, we were planning some back-to-school season on the wings of high double-digit growth, so this was the way we were planning the business, and all of a sudden June and July, the market dropped and the growth dropped to flat or even negative. That explained the very, very quick and material readjustment of stock by the mass retailers to have inventory more tuned with growth that is different from the double digits.","Now, I was not obviously expecting that nail would keep on growing 20% for many years to come. Obviously the huge growth for the last year, due to the increased penetration and increased uses for capital in the nail category was bound to slow down and to come back more in line with the growth of the total makeup category, but I think nobody was expecting such a drastic drop from double digit to flat or decline in two months. So that has triggered this very quick and very significant destocking activity of the mass retailers, and as I said, we see the impact particularly on our Sally Hansen brand.","Now the second part of the question was on the launches. So yes, in the second half of the year, we have launches and innovation on Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs. It will not be on the male category; it will be on the women\u2019s category, but we are going to have spring initiatives on both brands.","Neely Tamminga \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thank you, good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson, representing Citi Research. Please proceed.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research","Hi, good morning. My two questions are first one the productivity program, the sort of $40 million to $45 million of savings over the next few years. Do you expect that all of that is going to drop to the bottom line, or do you think some is going to be reinvested, and how are you thinking about that? And my second question is can you talk a little bi more about the expansion plan in Brazil and how you are sort of balancing the direct sales partnership you have with Jequiti and then which brands you\u2019re putting in O Boticario \u2013 you know, how do you manage the conflict there?","Michele Scannavini","Okay Sergio, will you answer the first part and I\u2019ll take the second one?","Sergio Perdreiro","Sure, yes. When we look at the program and the expected savings, let me just mention first that so far, we see we\u2019re trending a little bit better than expected, so the 40 to 45, we\u2019re definitely going to be on the high end of that range; we may even exceed it slightly. Now, the savings are used to support our growth. This means we invest behind the brands and also to support our emerging market expansion.","Michele Scannavini","As far as Brazil, so the way we are managing our business there between the two channels, we will have different products for the different channels. It doesn\u2019t mean necessarily different brands, but if the brand is sold in both channels, the product under the brand will be different.","I make an example with Adidas, for instance. Adidas will be one of the key brands for our joint venture with Frajo, part of the O Boticario group, and we will sell through this joint venture, let me say, our mainstream line of products. With Jequiti door-to-door, we are going to sell a special edition, specifically developed for Brazil, or a series of fragrances that will be connected to the upcoming soccer world championship that is going to happen in Brazil next year. So both channels will have Adidas, but different products so that we are not going to create competition between the two channels.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research","Okay, got it. And if I can just go back to the cost savings question, if I look at fiscal 2014 specifically, it seems like there is just a tremendous amount of competition both at the mass and prestige level in fragrances, and what with the destocking you\u2019re seeing at the beginning of the year in a seasonally important period and kind of, I assume, some of the cost savings coming a couple of years out, are you confident that in 2014 your earnings growth is in fact going to be higher than your revenue growth?","Michele Scannavini","First of all, let me say that we are always looking at our competitive position in the market, so if we are going to see increased investment and competitive activity in fragrances, we will keep our level of activity investment such as to defend or to increase our market share anyway. So for us, obviously, it is a priority not to lose position in the market.","Now while we are looking at that, we are also working on several efficiency programs in our company, so it is clearly our target to keep expanding our margins with activity that allows us to work in a more efficient way at the same time without putting prejudice on the money that we invest behind the brand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman, representing Barclays. Please proceed.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the destocking again, but really more granular. So just given commentary that we\u2019ve heard earlier this year from Elizabeth Arden, I\u2019m going to assume the bulk of the destocking you\u2019re seeing in North America has more been in fragrance so far, less so in color. So one, is that correct? Two, if you can talk a little bit about the lack of growth in OPI and what sounds like a decline in Sally. I mean, nail is still a super-hot category. It seems like there are a lot of upstart brands out there, and with nail being 40% of the color business, just love to hear a little bit about that business, if you\u2019re seeing destocking or if you\u2019re just seeing a slowdown in the market, or greater competition.","And then finally in Europe, in just broad comments about promotional activity in Europe, what category \u2013 is it primarily skin and body, so affecting Adidas mostly, or is it also in the facial color cosmetics, so Rimmel and\u2014well really primarily Rimmel and Manhattan? Thanks.","Michele Scannavini","Okay, so let\u2019s start with the first one where we see more the impact of destocking. So as I said in my script, we see it across categories but the category that\u2019s been hit the most for us is nail. And then, this is explainable based on what I described before in terms of how sudden was the consumption drop. Again, we are talking about the market that until May was growing double digits, and then June and July was flat to negative, and that we have with Sally Hansen more than one-third of share of the total nail market in the United States. So when you have such a sudden market drop and you are such a strong leader, obviously you are the one that pays the most in terms of destocking. So what I expect to see, I expect to see impact in the different categories where we operated from the destocking, but we know that the biggest impact will be in nail and particularly in Sally Hansen.","The second question was on the overall trend of nail. Now, I still believe the nail is a category that is bound to grow in the long run. Clearly as I said before, I don\u2019t expect nail, particularly in the U.S., to keep sustained double-digit growth for the future. The big gain in terms of penetration and consumer per capita has been obtained over the last two years, particularly thanks to the outstanding fashion innovation that brought a lot of people that was not interested or not using nail to approach the category. I believe that looking to the future, we can estimate for the category growth that could be more or less in line with the total makeup growth that is 3 to 4%. Obviously it\u2019s a category where we have seen the number of players over the last three to four years multiplying, the investment skyrocketing, so clearly it has become a much, much more competitive industry than it used to be before.","Now because of this, obviously we are focusing even more our attention to bring innovation that can put us again a step ahead from the other. I was mentioning that in Q2 with Sally Hansen, we are going to launch a new formula that gives an ultimate shining effect on the nail, that we know that is the most desired benefit that women look on the nail, and we will keep on try to strengthen our position in a category where we have the leadership, where we have very strong know-how, and where we have shown in the past to be always ahead of the others in terms of innovation. ","Now in terms of the promotional activity in Europe, this is something that was very strong, particularly in south Europe. It has been strong in the last few quarters because the market there is recessive. The market is declining in other European countries, including France now, so these promotional activities are across all the different products. We have seen now also that U.K. Germany, that are traditionally price-driven countries, given the softer trend of the market, also are playing stronger in that arena. ","Now, we have a very strong position in Europe and when there is a strong fight to keep promotion with the trade space in the store, we need to fight. Clearly going forward, we will be very selective in identifying the activity and the promotions that really can make the difference, because obviously we don\u2019t want to keep seeing going forward all the effort that we do to improve our cost of goods and to deliver savings with our supply chain offset by this kind of activity. Also, hopefully we will see the measures that the government in Europe is progressively taking to stimulate growth sooner or later will impact on the consumer spending power and improving the market trend, but until the market trend is recessive in Europe, is very difficult that we see a relief in the promotional pressure of the brands.","Now obviously the more the categories are value for money in terms of perception of consumers, the more the price war or the discount war can harm, and when you were mentioning different product categories, clearly toiletry is suffering more than makeup.","Operator","We will now take the final question from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser, representing B. Riley. Please proceed.","Linda Bolton Weiser \u2013 B. Riley","Hi. I was just wondering, on the profitability of your segments, you did note the good improvement in the operating margin in fragrance in FY13, and I\u2019m wondering if you think the improvement can be as big in FY14 or the other segments will kind of post better margin improvement? And do you think in skin and body, it will be profitable in FY14 or that it will take more than one year to get there? And secondly, I was just curious if you had specific numbers on price versus volume in the quarter and for the fiscal year, because you did report some of those numbers in your filing documents. So if you had specific numbers, that would be helpful, thanks.","Sergio Perdreiro","","Okay, so let me start with the profitability. We did see an improvement in the margin. It\u2019s important to look at the overall margin because the drivers of the improvement in our margins, starting with the gross margin, they really cut across all the categories. So the competitive manufacturing in our plants, the worldwide procurement program, the streamlining of our logistics and distribution services, they all cut across the categories and therefore we should see improvement in all of the categories.","The larger categories of fragrance and color are already benefiting from the scale and therefore performing at margins that are at par with the best players in the industry, and therefore we should continue to see this improvement as we go forward to be more marginal. When you get to the skin and body care, because of the smaller scale that we have in the business, we should see over the years the benefit of the building up the scale and a build-up of the margins that can also be fatter and more pronounced. We expect that in the course of the years with the footprint that we have today, therefore in the absence of acquisitions, that that segment can move to the mid single-digit margins.","To get to margins that are similar to what we see today in our fragrance and color business, it would naturally go through an acquisition that would increase the scale and also increase the mix in terms of what is body care and skin care, given that we are today much more indexed to the body care that has lower margins.","So in terms of the volume price, for the total year we had a 2% like-for-like increase. That 2% was 2% volume with zero impact of price mix. When you look at the quarter, it was more driven by volume, so the 4% growth on a like-for-like basis was the result of a 9% increase in volume and a 5% decrease in terms of price mix.","Operator","This concludes the question and answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Monaco. Please proceed.","Kevin Monaco","Thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your questions.

My name is Diane, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's First Quarter Financial 2016 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After speakers' remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 5. Thank you.","I will now turn the conference call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, please go ahead.","Kevin Monaco - Treasurer, Senior VP & Head-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Bart Becht, Chairman and Interim CEO; and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","All discussions of net revenues are on a like-for-like basis. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations do not reflect certain non-recurring and other charges. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Bart.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin. This morning we'll provide you with a brief update on the planned merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business, our recent corporate developments, and Q1 results. Then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions.","In July 2015, we announced the intended merger of Coty with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business to create a strong global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. Since that time, much has happened. Over the last few months, the financing structure for this transaction has been put in place. Extensive discussions with the 12 licensors have taken place. And to-date, I can confirm the 10 out of the 12 licenses will transfer to Coty upon regulatory approval and completion of the transaction.","This has allowed us to make good progress on the regulatory clearance process with the authorities. We have also announced the new organizational structure for the merged entity. That structure will be all about servicing consumers, which we believe will strengthen the growth trajectory of the merged entity over time.","The Coty business will be organized around three divisions, consisting of the Coty Luxury Division, the Coty Consumer Beauty Division and the Coty Professional Beauty Division. We will also form a new department focused on accelerating growth, by improving capabilities in areas such as innovation, traditional and digital communication, as well as sales execution and e-commerce.","As a precursor to the formation of this department, we recently acquired Beamly, a cutting edge digital marketing firm. This week we announced the acquisition of the Beauty & Personal Care business of Hypermarcas. This acquisition will help increase Coty's exposure to higher growth emerging markets and provide a strong platform to absorb both the current Coty business as well as the future P&G Specialty Beauty business in Brazil. Finally, we have just announced the new Coty executive team, effective subject to the closing of our merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business. It is a team of highly experienced and proven executives.","We believe the new consumer-centric and category-focused organizational structure has strong brand portfolio together with the new team will position Coty well to realize its ambition of becoming a true leader and challenger in the beauty industry and drive profitable growth and shareholder value over time.","Touching briefly on Q1, results were mixed. The operating profit and margin continues showing very strong progress with EPS growth substantially higher, clearly helped by one-off tax benefit. This confirms that our Global Efficiency Programs continues to generate the benefits we've been targeting.","On the other hand, revenue growth was not where we would like it to be. While Color Cosmetics growth continued to be very strong due to Sally Hansen and Rimmel, and Skin & Body Care trends are improving, Fragrance growth is lacking.","Fragrance revenues continue to suffer from a very large number of unsustainable historical launches, not being compensated by current brand building efforts and launches. We'll be working hard to clean up past portfolio practices, while strengthening our innovation pipeline and improving our capabilities in the areas of innovation and sales and marketing execution.","I'll now hand over the call to Patrice.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bart, and good morning everyone. Total Q1 net revenues declined 2% like-for-like. For the quarter, the adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points to 60.3% reflecting our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies.","We keep on building a better business. We've adjusted operating income growing 4% with a much more substantial 12% increase at constant currency. The adjusted operating margin grew 150 basis points with improvement in each of the segments, including an increase of 110 basis points in Fragrances; 280 basis points in Color Cosmetics; and 120 basis point in Skin & Body Care.","During the quarter, FX negatively impacted revenues and operating income by roughly 800 basis points. Our programs to build a better business have changed the mix of profit by geography, reducing the natural foreign exchange hedge in the quarter compared to prior periods.","We expect this FX impact to continue into Q2, and then moderate in the second half of the year. Supported by the one-time tax benefit of $130 million, and our profit growth, our Q1 adjusted diluted EPS increased to $0.59 from $0.28 in the prior year.","Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow, we had another very strong quarter. We generated $116.7 million in operating cash flow and $74 million in free cash flow up to over $100 million versus the prior-year, driven primarily by an improvement in the earnings profile and working capital.","Supported by this very strong cash flow, our $700 million share buyback program is progressing as planned, with over 60% of the program completed throughout November 4. We also increased our annual dividend by 25% this year from $0.20 to $0.25 per share. This dividend increase and ongoing share repurchase program demonstrate our confidence in Coty's ability to generate substantial cash flow as well as our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.","We recently closed on a $4.5 billion credit facility to refinance existing Coty debts with new borrowings subject to longer maturities, which was a great success, and well oversubscribed. I would like to add that, despite volatile financial markets, we increased the size of the Coty financings by $500 million, reflecting strong market demand.","In addition, certain lenders have committed to loan up to $4.5 billion to an affiliate of P&G, which is expected to become available to Coty in connection with the expected merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty business.","Finally, I wanted to share some additional details on our announced acquisition of Hypermarcas' Beauty & Personal Care business. This acquisition offers several excellent benefits for Coty.","First, it encompasses a portfolio of leading beauty brands in Brazil, which include leading retail position in skin care, nail polish, men's care, and men's hair color. Second, this acquisition brings a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant and distribution center.","Third, it offers critical go-to-market capabilities including sales and merchandizing force of approximately 630 people. And finally, while we will not disclose the full financials for the business, I'd like to point out that it is highly profitable with operating margin above current Coty levels.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operating Instructions] And our first question comes from Bill Schmitz. Your line is open.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Can we just like drill down a little bit on the Hypermarcas deal? I know you don't want to give us the exact numbers. But you know, it seems like about $50 million of EBITDA, so it's $20 million \u2013 sorry 20 times EBITDA is like the rough math on the deal. I just want to know if that's like directionally, right?","And are you buying it for the manufacturing and distribution center, are you buying it because you think there's still like a lot of legs left in the brand. And also, maybe how you think about the Brazilian beauty market, and kind of are we at the bottom, and do you think it's going to accelerate from here? Then I have a follow-up if I can.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So first, clearly Brazil even in today's environment is a faster growing market than the markets that we're in, in North America and in Western Europe. Still in most of the categories, in which Hypermarcas operates. This business also has shown basically good share progression over the last years. Clearly, its brands are also well-positioned in the market, because they don't tend to fit in the kind of like premium end \u2013 the super premium end of the market.","And therefore, certainly in the current environment, can be more be successful as a result of that. So we believe that this business has continued good growth potential, certainly ahead to where Coty is today, as you can imagine. So I would say that's point one.","Point two; this is a very profitable business. It's a business which has higher profitability than Coty has today. In terms of its capabilities, it provides us with a strengthening of our capabilities really in two areas. First, it has a state-of-the-art supply-chain, both from a manufacturing and a distribution and warehousing point of view, which is one of the key things that we're lacking on both the Coty and the P&G side. And so this will be a very welcome platform for us from a supply point of view.","From a go-to-market point of view, it is a very strong organization on the ground. Well supported by a proven management team, considering the market share results. And so, also this clearly will help us when we integrate the three businesses between P&G, Hypermarcas and Coty is to have a very, very strong team and go-to-market organization going forward.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then can we just talk about the Fragrance category, so like what you think the big challenges are? How the holiday season is progressing? How far along are we on the inventory cleanup of some of the tail inventory?","And then, just broadly speaking the health of the Calvin Klein brand, because I feel sometimes that you guys do more than your fair share of work trying to build the equity there, but if the brand owner is going to continue to divert it and over distribute it, it's almost like you're running against hurricane force winds, because the brand equity keeps getting diluted, so it's almost like a fool's errand, because it's kind of hard to control your destiny when the brand is diluted in another channels. I'd love to hear your thoughts there.","And again, the difference between, kind of, sellout versus shipments relative to the inventory destocking you guys kind of referenced.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. There clearly \u2013 there have been a number of unsustainable efforts from a sales point of view, and there has also been a number of unsustainable lines of businesses, which were launched over the last couple of years, which are coming back to haunt us today, and are not being offset or more than offset by our current brand building efforts and launches.","So I think you've already alluded to what the issue there is. So I don't need to elaborate on that, all I can say is that, there are \u2013 before everybody is seriously depressed about this business, there are some very nice successes also. We do have the Marc Jacobs Decadence, which is off to a very, very strong start. We have Miu Miu, which is off to a very strong start.","But it is more than offset by a number of past launches and practices, which and quite frankly, we're going to have to go through and clean up. As a result of that, from a growth point of view, for the full year, I'm not looking for a material improvement against the Q1 trend as we have it today. Because we will need to continue to have a number of cleanup efforts over the balance of the year potentially going into next year, and they will impact, in particular, the Fragrance category.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Hello?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Hello, John.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. You can't hear me?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Now we can.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Sorry about that. So, as we look at the trend from the Procter businesses, obviously the trends have continued to be tough. How should we think about how you view those businesses and the performance before you get a hold of them? Because we get a lot of questions in terms of the trends and everything, and kind of \u2013 I guess what kind of shape are you expecting those businesses to be in when they get transferred?","And then, secondly, I just want to follow-up on sort of \u2013 if we could get some thoughts in terms of the power brands, and how you feel about sort of the shift in spending that you've had on those, do you feel like you're beginning to see the underlying equities improve on the power brands, given your new strategy? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So on the P&G trends, clearly, we cannot comment you know on that. What I can tell you from the e-market performance, which is publicly available is that, this business is performing at a better level than where Coty is performing. So \u2013 are all the trends positive? No, there are certain brands where there clearly are challenges. And you can look at the U.S. market data, I'm sure which you have access to, and clearly identify that.","On a global basis, there are also pockets where they're doing very well. And I think that's probably all I can say about the P&G trend for the time being. So I do anticipate you know, that this business would come to us in a shape and a form, which is very much when we did the transaction. I don't think there will be substantial change from what we anticipated.","On the power brands, improving brand's equity is one of the key things that we have and are starting to work on. If you ask me, you know, as you know, brand equity doesn't change overnight, doesn't even change in 12 months, no matter what you do. So this will take some time, but this is going to be a key focus.","We need to move Coty much more from a, let's call it, sell-in type mentality to sell-out type of mentality, and that clearly means that, we need to do much more work in terms of building the brands from the ground up, through brand equity programs like communication programs and innovation programs.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian. Your line is open \u2013 from Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, first just a couple of clarity questions, did two licensees under the P&G portfolio that you've not reached an agreement on, are those still up in the air or are you not expecting them to transfer and how big are they? And then second, are you expecting like-for-like revenue growth here for the full year, or is that no longer realistical with the Fragrance trends, I'm assuming it's not, but just want a clarity there.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So 10 out of the 12 are confirmed to transfer. So that pretty much means they're signed-off, fully signed-off. The remaining two, one just in progress, and one basically is declined, but the one which has declined is very, very small. So we're talking a couple of percentage points of the total P&G net revenue, and therefore is not really a concern.","And the last one is still being discussed. So there is no news on that. We do not disclose basically what the sizes of the ones which are being discussed. All I can tell you is that, the one which is being discussed is not immaterial, is a material one, and that's it.","In terms of like-for-like growth, just to be crystal clear, I do not anticipate that, what we've seen in Q1 will materially change for the full year 2016. I think the Fragrance trends might improve from where we are today. Having said that, on the Color Cosmetics side, as you all know, we'll be lapsing a major launch which is the Miracle Gel.","And so, I would expect that we would continue to see good momentum on Color, but probably not to the same extent as what we've seen so far. So I think, you will see offsetting trends with an overall situation where at this point in time, I do not anticipate a material improvement versus Q1.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then can you just talk a little bit about the balance between top line growth and margins, obviously strong profit performance here in Q1, revenues didn't come through to the extent you expected. So does that mean more investment going forward \u2013 any kind of tweaks in the way you view that or is it more kind of you look to innovation and other areas to drive growth going forward?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we continue to anticipate that we will have a good improvement on operating margin also for the full year. Not to the same extent that we have in Q1. But we will have operating margin improvement for the full year, both at constant and actual rates. The efficiency programs will come through. We're not worried about that. We are tracking those very closely, and so they (20:14) bottom line, some of that will be reinvested back in the business.","But you know, we are still building a better business from a margin point of view for the full year. Clearly on EPS, you know \u2013 and EPS will be good, because we have a huge return on one-off tax benefits. So that's not really up for discussion. But margin-wise we will continue to make progress. Clearly, as we've discussed before, we are working harder and harder in terms of improving this business structurally. And that means, moving this from a sell-in to a sell-out organization, and that will take some time.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. That's helpful.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Can you guys talk maybe a little bit more specifically about \u2013 I guess maybe what the cleanup means in Fragrances for the overall size of the business. I'm just trying to dimensionalize it, I mean, is 5% of the Fragrance business perhaps unsustainable or is it 10% or 20%, like how big a deal is this for you guys?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm not going to answer that, a) because it's work in progress. And so, I would say this is premature to have this discussion. It is very clear that we have a number of lines of business where \u2013 which are not sustainable, which we have to tackle. And we will tackle those over time. We will not be able to tackle all of those in one go.","So \u2013 and at the same time, we need to push much harder in terms of structurally building our brands from a brand equity point of view and an innovation point of view. So I'm not going to give you any clarity on this point.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I guess two quick follow-ups; I guess one, how big an element of the Hypermarcas deal also is tax savings or duty avoidance in manufacturing locally for the whole business? And then the motivation behind moving to London, I get like proximity to Europe for a lot of the executives, but is there a tax element to that too, if you can just flesh that a little bit would be great? Thanks.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so Chris on the first part of the question clearly the Hypermarcas deal is primarily a business reason. We wanted \u2013 as Bart said, we wanted to have a platform in Brazil with state-of-the-art go-to-market capabilities and manufacturing ability. So that's the main reason why we're acquiring this business. There are some tax benefits that Hypermarcas is enjoying, that will go with the transaction. So that's for sure. But that's not the primary reason.","On the second question, which is the executive committee in London, actually the underlying reason why we're doing that is, first \u2013 that we want the headquarter not to be in the same location as one of the headquarter of the division. We just don't want the ExCom to overlook systematically the divisions. The divisions are fully empowered to drive the business, fully focused and dedicated management team. So that's really important.","The second point is that, we wanted to be in an area where we can also attract talent for the headquarter, and that is really from an infrastructure standpoint. And so, clearly, London was an ideal location if you exclude Paris and Geneva where we have already a headquarter of a division.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So that's not really tax driven.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No.","Operator","And our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. First on Fragrance, how do you assess whether it's really the focus on cleaning up the portfolio versus just underlying challenges in that category that you've been facing for some time.","And then, on the Hypermarcas deal, is there sufficient capacity already existing at their facility so that you can self-manufacture or should you want to want some of your own brands. And on the tax structure, is that going to \u2013 are the benefits that they get going to pass along to you, do you have a sort of sign-off on that?","And then just lastly on the trends there, it looks like the sales trends have been relatively solid, but their margin trends have been less so, I know the absolute margin is better than yours, but the trajectory hasn't been great, so how do you think about plans to manage that business versus what prior management has done? Thanks so much.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Right. That was a bunch of questions. So let me make sure \u2013 so I think the first one was on Fragrance. So can you repeat that one more time, because I kind of lost track of your questions?","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry, I should've probably asked it in parts. But on Fragrance, it was just \u2013 how do you know that it's really what's driving that decline is the things that you're doing versus just underlying challenges in the category that you've been facing for some time?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would say, so as you know the Fragrance category overall is not a high growth basically category, so that doesn't \u2013 and clearly that doesn't help us. Having said that, within the category, you know there are certain brands from a portfolio point of view, yes, you're right, that we have a drag on the tail \u2013 from the tail, and particularly where it is, celebrity fragrances clearly, in terms of e-market performance.","But we also have launched historically, on a number of key brands. New lines which clearly were not sustainable. And never basically had a chance of being sustainable for any medium or long-term. And so that clean up, that decay rate that you have on those lines and the cleanup associated with that is going to depress the net revenues going forward before we can put things in place or as we're putting things in place to really fundamentally drive the business from an equity and innovation point of view.","On Hypermarcas, I'm going to handover to Patrice on the tax, but before we get there on the infrastructure, since I've been there, this is truly a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, which can produce anything from nail care to skin care products, to deodorants and many other personal care items. It has a state-of-the-art warehousing facility site as well. So it is something \u2013 it also produces hair colorants, which will be clearly helpful as we absorb the P&G business.","So it is something which we can build on, which, if we would have done this without it, in our wildest dreams, we wouldn't have gotten there until years from now. So from an infrastructure point of view, it is a true help. It's the same on the go-to-market side, because it has a very large sales force, which clearly will be very helpful when we absorb the other two business into it.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","And so to complement the balance on Hypermarcas. So first of the tax line, so clearly we anticipate most of the tax benefits to transfer, and we will be working very closely with Hypermarcas towards this objective. But more broader, so in terms of capacity, so clearly there are some capacity that we'll be able to welcome our products.","And if you think about the synergies and the accretion of the deal, I will not be very specific. But what I can tell you is that, we do expect this acquisition to provide some benefits on both the synergy side and the one-time CapEx side, which we have focused for the merger with a P&G Specialty Beauty Business. However, it's clearly premature to determine any precise amounts.","And excluding any synergy with the anticipated merger with the P&G Specialty Beauty Business, we would expect this deal to be marginally EPS accretive in year two. So I think this acquisition is spot on our strategy, is facilitating the merger of P&G, and is creating a great platform in Brazil, as Bart said, and we are very excited and happy about it.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So \u2013 and just to answer your last question in terms of margin trend. The margin trend is not deteriorating on this business. As you know, this is a business which is, they have two fundamental businesses. One is their consumer business; the other one is their healthcare or pharmacy\/OTC business. Within the consumer business you have two businesses. You have the paper business or a diaper business, and you have the business that we're buying. The margin trends on the business that we're buying has not deteriorated over the last years.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi. Your line is open.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon or good morning. Two quick questions for you, the follow-up on the deal in Brazil, does that change your strategy or your thoughts about your joint venture with Avon in Brazil, and will you continue to market their fragrances?","And then my second question is, on the gross margin expansion in the quarter, you talked about that being a function of your productivity savings. But I'm wondering if there was also a component of favorable mix shift in there, and can you remind us kind of what the gross margin is for fragrance relative to color and skin? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, on Avon, no it doesn't really impact what we do with Avon. As you know, the business in Brazil, from a market point of view, is very much split between what happens door-to-door and what happens at retail. So the Hypermarcas business, the current Coty business and a big chunk of the P&G business is really \u2013 is a retail business.","What we were doing with Avon is very much focused on different products in a different channel. So they don't really impact each other. They might at some point in time, but certainly not for the time being. On the gross margin...","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","On the margin, so on the margin, the vast majority of our margin is coming from the supply chain efficiency, and from the Productivity Program, which is part of the Global Efficiency Plan that I've referred to previously. Actually there is no mix, which is favorable, and we are not going to comment and give you any details on the gross margin by segment. I think what we're doing is, we're giving the operating margin, but we're not giving you any further details, and I want to stick to that.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And I know we'll see it once we get the Q. But can you comment directionally on just the A&P line, how much that changed year-over-year, and whether that was a timing issue, or how much that contributed, if you will, to the first quarter operating margin expansion.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. A good question. So on that one, we keep on going into our journey of shifting more money from non-strategic spend to strategy spend. In other words, the working media keeps on increasing quarter after quarter, which is what we have to do to build a sustainable business.","So what you will see is that, in constant rates the overall NCP line will slightly decrease, but actually the working media is increasing, and it's the non-working media actually where we keep on making effort to generate some efficiency there.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nik Modi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks for the question. Hey, Bart, I was wondering maybe if you can comment on organizational stress, I mean, you guys have been very busy, a lot of big initiatives going on. Maybe if you could just \u2013 is there something you worry about and can you help us understand how you're kind of managing all these moving pieces and all these balls in the air. Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so \u2013 and what you \u2013 it is a very good question. Clearly, what you're seeing is a company which is in reconstruction mode. And that clearly is also from an organizational and a staffing point of view.","And as I alluded to, we need to shift in essence on two main levers; one is to move from a sell-in much more to a sell-out and brand building mode. And on the other side, clearly from a organizational point of view, and from a staffing point of view, we will continue to focus on upgrading the bench, and clearly most of those efforts need to be seen in the context of the merger.","And I think you've seen the first step of that at the first level, the executive committee level, where we have purposely looked for the best of both worlds. And where we believe we need to complement that with an external candidate, and you've seen this already at the executive committee level happening is, we will go outside to make sure that we get a very strong team, which ultimately is going to build this business over the long-term.","So a lot of efforts at the moment, even though it is somewhat painful on a quarterly basis are there to do the right thing and to build something which can become a true leader in the beauty industry.","Nik H. Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steph Wissink from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just a couple of questions. First, guys, if you could just talk a little bit about the post-merger and the closure of Hypermarcas, how should we think about the pro forma split between domestic and international both on the sales and class basis?","And then on the Fragrance side, I just want to follow-up on Wendy's earlier question that, how much of that maturation is tied to the contracts, and the commitment to a certain number of fragrance launches per contract, is some of the work done related to contract exits or ending? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","You're going to have to clarify the second question for a second, because I'm not sure I really understood. Are you implying that fragrance launches are tied to contractual obligations to our licensors?","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah. If there is such a structure, if you have committed to multiple fragrances over a period of time, if those contracts actually need to expire in order to work down some of the inventory related to some of those earlier fragrances?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll answer the questions. So, first on Hypermarcas, so the entire business is in Brazil, there is no business outside of Brazil. So it's very, very clean. So that's question one.","The second question about fragrance launches, the launches of fragrance are decided in between the licensor and Coty. And this is clearly \u2013 when you have a license brand, you have a clear positioning of a brand and there is a discussion with a licensor within that context in terms of what we should launch over time. And that's an ongoing discussion and this is not \u2013 that's not really a contractual discussion, it is a discussion how to best basically manage their brands in the cosmetics arena. And that involves not just launches, but clearly also involves how we execute basically in the market. It's not a contractual obligation discussion.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just related to the other question related to the post-merger and closure of Hypermarcas, can you talk about Procter plus the Brazilian business, and your business, how we should think about the split domestic versus international both on a cost and sales basis. What I'm trying to understand, I think is, the centralization versus the localization of cost. How should we think about the FX hedging and some of your exposure on a global basis? Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'm not going to disclose specific data, what I can tell you is that, between the three businesses, Hypermarcas is the largest business, P&G is a second largest business and Coty is a third largest business, and Coty has a relatively small business there today.","So, then within that clearly, we have \u2013 and we have a Fragrance and Skin business. We will have, which we call a Luxury business. Then clearly we have a Consumer Beauty business, which is all everything, which is in Color Cosmetics, hair retailing and body care, which will be the biggest chunk of what's in Brazil, and then finally we have a salon business.","So the biggest chunk will sit in the middle in the Coty Consumer Beauty business. The second biggest business will sit in salon, and the third largest business will sit in the Fragrance and Skin Care business. That gives you a rough idea. So, in terms of size, Hypermarcas is one, P&G is two, Coty is three.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And to add on that, clearly, the reason why we acquired Hypermarcas is we need to have a platform in terms of manufacturing and go-to-market capabilities. So, in terms of localizing our costs, our cost of operating, it clearly gives you the answer there.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Just to be clear, without the transaction to absorb the P&G business, we would have had substantial FX exposure.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","And this is clearly another motivating reason why we did the transaction, because they don't have to tell you when you have to import into Brazil, you have a raft of issues well beyond even the FX.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] And our next question comes from Jason Gere from KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. I just have two questions, and they're not about Brazil. So the first one, I guess, I just want to get your perspective on some of the channel disruptions in food, drug and mass, we've heard about Walmart, and some of the announcement, SKU rationalization, Walgreens and Rite Aid combining maybe some store closures. I recognize that in nine months you guys will be in a \u2013 I guess a better position of strength with P&G in the fall.","But just wondering if I can get your perspective on just the food, drug and mass channel, what you see happening over the next year? And then just kind of tying in how e-commerce kind of maybe could come in and kind of serve as a little bit more of a panacea to that? And then I have a follow-up?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so the last point is the major disruption. So the two disruptions which are happening in the consumer goods space is, one, is in terms of digital communication with the consumer and the other one is e-commerce those are the two disruptive factors.","The other factors that you're highlighting, which is talking about inventory management at Walmart and Walgreens is a discussion which we've had for the last, probably 10 years. And that will continue to happen.","Every single time that any of our retailer sees an increase in inventories, because they're ordering ahead, basically of the sell-out trend, they will immediately pare back from an inventory point of view. And that will happen from time-to-time. Normally that happens for us in the second quarter. It might happen again. So those types of things are you know more the ongoing normal discussion.","In terms of \u2013 so, I would highlight, on your key discussions what's happening from an e-commerce point of view. And that could be e-commerce on your traditional retailers or new retailers because that's where the growth is of the entire market. There is very little growth in the bricks-and-mortar segment.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, I guess, just in terms of the context of just \u2013 with Walmart and the drugstores, how do you think about the tail brands kind of surviving through some of this. I know that you are kind of managing those more for cash. So just wondering, is that kind of built into your expectations for maybe the next two years like these brands could kind of get pushed aside, but hopefully the power brands will kind of sort of step-up and kind of overcompensate?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so on the tail brands, some of them over time will not survive, some of them will survive. So that's kind of like building what we've said about this fiscal year. In terms of the longer-term, we are and we will be going through a full portfolio review on the margin entity, and then we will communicate to market in due time. But that's work in progress, that's not completed. And so that is really something which we'll be discussing with you some time next year.","Jason M. Gere - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just the question, when you guys announced the P&G merger, you gave kind of a pro forma number. So obviously, there's a lot of moving parts since that date. P&G's numbers, the change in your structure, acquisitions et cetera. When do you think you might be able to kind of provide us a little bit more clarity on what the kind of the go-forward pro forma number might look like or a little bit more context, so we can put into the numbers, into our modeling? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I could give you a very broad answer sometime next year. So, this is \u2013 you have to kind of understand how this process works. We have just appointed the executive committee, clearly we are working on the next level, and then we'll work on the levels below that. As you're working your way down into the organization, you are essentially, you know, also creating the cost structure associated with that.","So the progress in terms of clarifying the specific synergy number and confirming the synergy numbers, which we've given to the market or providing any perspective around that is \u2013 happens as we are going through this process. So it will happen, hopefully it will happen sometime in the first half, but it's premature to give you a firm date on that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is open.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, and hi everybody. I'm more curious \u2013 has your strategy evolved by managing luxury and the mass businesses? And if yes, sort of, what has changed? And sort of, related to that, how much overlap is there between managing luxury fragrances and other categories together?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So, I think you can see our thinking in this area on display in terms of what we've announced relative to the new structure of the organization. So we clearly have three divisions, and the first of the divisions are Fragrances and Skin Care is very much focused on that category, it's predominantly a prestige and license business.","In terms of the mass fragrance, which sits in there, we will basically, they will manage that, because from a consumer point of view, there is very little difference. If they buy a mass fragrance or a prestige fragrance. Trust me, the consumer does not think about buying a mass fragrance or a prestige fragrance.","So the fundamental thinking and should sit in that, basically in that division. And we will continue basically to leave that with them to manage from a consumer point of view. Both the mass as well as the luxury part of the fragrance.","Having said that, going forward we have to be very clear, this is 80% plus is going to be a prestige license type business, in the fragrance area. So the mass will be part of that. But will be the smaller parts, so the thinking is going to be more towards the upper end and the bottom end of the market.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay. And just a clarification, commentary on synergies, did something change there or are the expectations both organic as well as the acquired businesses the same as they were?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","There is no change to our commentary, so far on the synergies, you know, with respect to the P&G merger. This was the question before when we get an update on that, and that will happen sometime next year, but for the time being, it is what it is. There's absolutely no reason to believe it should be higher or lower. It is what it is.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just lastly, on personnel, do you anticipate any more major leadership changes at this point comings and goings or is what we see, what it will be plus whatever backfill to go behind those folks?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No. Like I said, for the merged entity, we are, very focused on getting the best and the most basically, and certainly the best of the two companies, and where needed. We will complement this with external candidates. But we've gone through this process as we speak. Right now, we're recruiting and we're working with both the P&G and Coty organization to get the best on level two. And that will be announced in due time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. I have a follow-up with regards to earnings, and I understand perfectly that your progression for 2016 and 2017 remains work in progress because of the moving pieces. But could you ballpark the incremental overhead cost to manage the Procter brands.","And with this, I mean, what is the ongoing SG&A \u2013 this is beyond one-time spendings and CapEx. This is point number one. And have you considered a slowing down or, perhaps, holding your pre-merger cost-cutting plan to harmonize it with these broader changes that you're making, given all these acquisitions. And I have a follow-up question.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No. In terms of the Global Efficiency Programs, they will continue, as we've outlined. There is absolutely zero reason to stop any of that, what we're doing in that area because of the P&G merger. The P&G merger will provide additional opportunities from an efficiency point of view, and there's no question about that. And they're very clearly identified in many pockets, be it in supply chain or in the SG&A area.","So there is a very clear plan. Now, the question will be, is really, as we go through the process, is to update all the assumptions and to make sure that we are going to achieve the numbers that we've outlined. In terms of incremental overhead cost to manage the P&G brands, so clearly, we're not going to have the Coty SG&A to manage the larger organization. There will be incremental SG&A.","That's not the question. The question is really the sum of the two basically will drive certain synergies. And we have clearly communicated what we believe the synergies are. And so for the time being, there's no update on that.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Thank you. And the second question is that, I noticed that your title remains Interim CEO. If there's a CEO search, could you just tell us what's going? Hello?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hello?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","I can hear you. Yes.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Sorry for that. I was on the speaker. So basically, if there is a CEO search, and if you can you tell us whether you're considering to bring in someone with operating experience in beauty, if that is a requisite, and what is the timeframe for that search? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So there is no search. So at some point in time, there might be a search, but there's no search. And the reason why there's no search is that, with the board we've decided at the time, which was like in June-July of this year, that I should stay in place and very much make sure that we are going to gradually transform the Coty business and make the merger a success.","Once we get to a situation where we believe that \u2013 we have reason to believe that, that's going to be the case, we will come back to this. So that might mean that I'll become one of the longest-serving Interim CEOs, but so be it. So it is not really time-dependent. It's really KPI-dependent \u2013 the CEO situation.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Thursday, August 13. I will now like to turn the call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, please go ahead.","Kevin Monaco - Treasurer, Senior VP & Head-Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining us. On today's call are Bart Becht, Chairman and Interim CEO and Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and reports filed with the SEC where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","All discussions of net revenues are on a like-for-like basis. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations do not reflect certain non-recurring and other charges. You can find the bridge from reported to adjusted results in the reconciliation table in the earnings release. I will now turn the call over to Bart.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Kevin, and welcome, everybody to Coty's fourth quarter and full year conference call. This morning, we'll take you through a summary of today's announcement, and then Patrice and I will be pleased to take your questions.","2015 was a good year, and Q4 results were equally encouraging. On a full year basis, our strategy is investing in and fueling growth of our brand while at the same time driving strong profit growth behind efficiency program is translating into tangible results as power brands net revenues grew low-single digits like-for-like, adjusted operating profit grew mid-single digits, and adjusted diluted EPS were well into the double digits.","We still have work to do in returning Coty to top-line growth. But the strong progress in increased savings targets for our Global Efficiency Program, which Patrice will detail in a minute, should give us the flexibility to invest additional capital in our business and very gradually, reignite growth.","Growth on our power brands during the year was driven by Marc Jacobs and Chlo\u00e9 in Fragrances, Sally Hansen and Rimmel and Color Cosmetics, and philosophy in Skin & Body Care, offset by lesser performances on the remaining power brands.","To add a bit of insight around the brands contributing to our growth, in some of our growth initiatives going forward, I would like to highlight that Sally Hansen's Miracle Gel line continues to be an outstanding success, boosting Sally Hansen's market share of the combined U.S. and European nail markets by approximately 8 percentage points to 27% last quarter. We intend to build on this momentum with the launch of Miracle Gel 2.0 with a Top Coat that doubles the volume of the manicure and extend the Miracle Gel color selection by an additional 20 shades.","Other notable new innovations in early fiscal 2016 include Marc Jacobs Decadence, Calvin Klein Eternity Now, Rimmel's Match Perfection Foundation and the launch of the first Miu Miu fragrance by the end of the first fiscal quarter.","As we continue to invest behind our power brands in fiscal 2016, we are targeting a very gradual improvement in the total Coty like-for-like net revenues coupled with continued good growth momentum on the bottom line.","On the M&A side, the Bourjois integration is proceeding as planned, and we remain excited about the strategic and financial opportunities for this brand. We remain equally excited about the merger agreement with P&G's fragrances, color cosmetics and hair color businesses, and the potential of this transaction for Coty.","We believe we will not just create a pure play global leader in challenging the beauty industry with approximately $10 billion in revenues, but it will also offer material cost and cash savings, as well as longer term enhanced growth opportunities. We will also continue our share repurchase program with $700 million authorized by the board.","I will now hand over the call to Patrice who will provide a few comments on the financials and our updated targets for the Global Efficiency Program.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Bart, and good morning everyone. Total net revenues were flat like-for-like in the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, the adjusted gross margin increased 160 basis points to 59.9%. During the year, our adjusted gross margin increased 50 basis points to 60.1%. The solid improvement in gross margin reflected our continuous effort in driving supply chain efficiencies despite an ongoing increased level of discount and allowances.","We have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and identifying additional savings opportunities. Given our execution success thus far, we are raising the savings target for our Global Efficiency Program by 35% to $270 million. As you will recall, our original $200 million target by fiscal 2017 included $20 million from the China business reorganization, $60 million from the productivity program, and $120 million from the One Coty reorganization.","With over a year of progress on these programs, we now see the China reorganization yielding $45 million in savings, the productivity program offering $65 million of savings, and One Coty generating $160 million. We are now approximately halfway towards this new saving target as we saw $105 million in savings in fiscal 2015 following the $25 million savings we generated in fiscal 2014.","This incremental $70 million of savings stem from our existing efforts to drive efficiencies, including indirect procurement and more streamlined operation in China. As a result, we do not expect to incur additional cost associated with these savings beyond the $250 million to $300 million we had previously outlined.","In the fourth quarter, our adjusted operating margin grew 120 basis points supported by the efficiency realized from our savings program. Our fiscal 2015 adjusted operating income grew 6% with margin expansion of 100 basis points to 12% from 11% in the prior year.","During the year, we continued to execute on our strategy on investing behind our power brands while maintaining discipline in our overall spending and reducing non-strategic spend. Total A&CP at constant currency was in line with prior year while the A&CP for our power brands increased by mid single digits. As Bart mentioned, power brands net revenue grew low single digit during the year, an indication that our investment strategy is beginning to bear fruit.","By segment, our fiscal 2015 Fragrance adjusted operating margin improved 150 basis points, reaching a new high of 16.2%. The Skin & Body Care adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 2%, while the Color Cosmetic margin declined modestly by 40 basis points to 11.1%, reflective of the acquisition of the Bourjois business. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 to be a transition year for Bourjois as we integrate and optimize the operating model with Bourjois becoming accretive to our Color Cosmetic earnings profile in fiscal 2017.","Moving down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate for the year was 15% compared to 18.9% in the prior year. At this time, we expect our long-term adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 25% with potential for viability depending on the mix of profit by region. Altogether, our fiscal 2015 adjusted diluted EPS $0.99 was slightly above the upper end of our guidance range and reflected very strong 22% growth.","2015 was also another strong year of cash generation as operating cash flow totaled $526 million and the free cash flow totaled $325 million, up from $305 million in the prior year. This was our sixth consecutive year of generating more than $300 million in free cash flow.","Our cash conversion ratio adjusted for cash restructuring cost exceeded 100% demonstrating our strong ability to convert solid profit growth into even stronger cash generation. We ended the year with $2.3 billion in net debt. We also announced this morning that we are continuing our share repurchase program with the board authorizing $700 million which includes any remaining amounts under the prior authorization. This authorization further supports our commitment to return cash to shareholders and is consistent with our repurchase of over $900 million in Coty stock over the last 18 months, including the repurchase of Class B shares from Berkshire Partners and Rh\u00f4ne Capital. Our results illustrate that we are building a better business and are well on our way to become a strong leader in the global beauty industry.","Let me now spend a minute on the announced merger with the P&G beauty business. As we communicated to you last month, the P&G Business had fiscal year 2014 revenues of $5.9 billion, a carve-out of EBITDA of approximately $1.15 billion, which excludes $400 million of non-transferred costs. We expect to realize $550 million in total cost savings including the $400 million in non-transferred costs, which will be an immediate benefit at close and an incremental $150 million in net synergies to be recognized by the end of the third year after close.","We expect to realize these net synergies from areas like procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and SG&A net of the investment we plan to make in order to run businesses in which we are not currently present, such as hair color, and to support a business, which is double the size of Coty standalone. Beyond this synergy expectation, we intend to leverage best practice from each of the businesses and to improve the underlying performance of the combined company.","Efforts to prepare for the closing of the transaction and ensure smooth integration and transition are well underway. Each organization has appointed transition teams and Coty has also appointed a post-merger integration team. This team meets on a weekly basis with the transition teams to coordinate activities and then provides visibility on the overall progress to the executive leadership. We have met with the different parts of the P&G organization with each meeting reinforcing our excitement about the combination of these two strong businesses.","Thank you. We will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Isabel Schmitz (sic) [Bill Schmitz] from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","It's actually Bill Schmitz. I don't know where Isabel came from.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bill.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. One housekeeping question and just a question on the acquisition. Can you tell us what the savings are to-date from the program?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Sorry, can you say that again?","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The savings to-date for the restructuring program.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","On the Global Efficiency Program, it's $105 million and we have achieved $25 million last year. So that would be $130 million year-to-date, which is roughly halfway on the overall savings target of $270 million.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then can we just have an update on the acquisition sort of how the license discussion \u2013 the fragrance license discussions are progressing, any further color, any potential divestitures? And then kind of as you look at the channel inventory like the quality and quantity of kind of what's in the channel right now, especially at some of the wholesalers and diverters?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Well, I can give you an update on that. So we have visited all bar one of the licensors. I would say the initial discussions are very positive, but it is still very early days. So we need to have further discussions and ultimately, clearly we need to have pieces of paper signed for the transfer of all the licenses. So it's early days. But so far, I would say the discussions are very encouraging.","In terms of the quality of the businesses, there is nothing really to discuss for the time being. And also, we're not at liberty to discuss anything because, clearly P&G is a public company and this is part of their business until the deal is closed. So I can't really comment on that. But I would say overall as Patrice already has outlined, there are teams basically on both sides. They're working very cooperatively together in terms of getting the deal closed and getting the business integrated. It's very early days, but the projects have been kicked off on the right footing.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. I appreciate the commentary. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. First, with Procter, what are you guys discussing during meetings and like who is involved on both sides?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So there is a very large group of people involved on both sides. Right now, we are literally having hundreds of people basically involved in both including the transaction and integrating the business. So there are transition teams on both sides. The transition teams are very much focused on closing the transaction, so that's everything from transfer of licenses to antitrust filings to financing, legal and tax issues. And then there is a post-merger integration team, which works clearly with people from both sides in terms of actually integrating the business, so which is everything from organizational structure, staffing, culture for the new company, ways of working, as well as IS, supply integration, so all the physical aspects of the deal. But like I said, this whole process has just been kicked off. So it's still very early days. But all I can say is that it's been a very constructive process on both sides.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Have you guys identified the key members of management on the Procter side yet, who will be coming over with the deal?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So from a organizational structure and staffing point of view, that's just been kicked off and the executive team should be selected in the next couple of months. I mean that goes beyond just the executive committee, including basically people which are reporting below that.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then just on sales, you guys talked a lot last quarter about starting to build the reinvestment into your power brands and now that you've realized a lot of those significant cost savings. But you also mentioned that it would take time and you reiterated that again today. So relative to your own expectations, was flat organic sales for this quarter in line with your expectations? And can you give a little bit more parameters around quote-unquote taking time? Because I'm just curious also how much you've started to already push the incremental spend and how that's going to build and what ultimately you think you can grow at long term?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think it will be a very gradual process in terms of building top line growth momentum. I don't think it will be a rapid acceleration from where we are today for a variety of reasons. It takes a long time in the beauty industry to build momentum in general because it requires basically an extensive pipeline of the right innovations and initiatives that go into the market. And at the same time, as you well know, we still have a drag basically from a legacy celebrity fragrance business, which is a drag basically on the growth of the total company. So I do think it will take time.","The market growth the company is exposed to is somewhere around 2% since we're mostly an established-markets business. In terms of selling, in terms of segments in countries we're exposed to, market growth rate is slightly ahead of 2%. And clearly we need to be, at some point in time, to grow at least in line with the market, but it will take time. So I would say that's the ultimate target where we want to be is to be at least in line with the market, if not ahead of that. But it will take time to get there.","I would say on the other side, from a profit point of view, so from a top line point of view, I think it is going to take longer than I originally anticipated. From a bottom line point of view, we are well ahead of where I thought we would be originally. And I can see a continued very strong momentum from a bottom line point of view going forward.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And then just lastly on the launch, as you mentioned, Miu Miu at the end of Q1. But could you give us a little bit more detail on some of the other big launches? Because I'm just looking at the Q1 comp and that's particularly tough this year. So it sounds like while you expect modest growth for the year, perhaps you're not necessarily expecting \"modest\" growth every quarter of this year. Thanks.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","That's correct. Q1 will be one of the tougher comparisons because we had a big Calvin Klein launch last year, which clearly meant we had substantial pipeline fill last year in the first quarter, which we'll be indexing against.","So, now, Miu Miu will be a good launch in my mind, but it is not all hitting in the first quarter. It's beginning as the quarter evolves. And the other big launch, which will be there, which is Decadence, is really happening at the very end of the first quarter. So, you're absolutely correct. We're looking for very modest growth for the full year, but Q1 will be a bit more of a challenge.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Obviously very good gross margin expansion this quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how discounted allowance has played in. Obviously, you guys have talked about that as an initiative, the ability to roll that back and not lose volume growth, I guess, particularly in Fragrance. So, if you could talk a little bit about that, that'd be great?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In terms of \u2013 so we had positive price mix impact in the fourth quarter, which clearly indicates that we are gradually starting to improve in this area. Having said that, we need to see both good volume momentum and good price mix momentum. And so far, we've not really been able to combine the two in every single quarter and we need to be able to do that consistently.","So, we are making some progress on the discounts and allowances front. We need to make progress on both volume and discount and allowances front going forward. So, there's still work to be done in this area.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But, I guess, following up, are there specific places, specific brands, specific businesses where you are or you have been able to combine both where you weren't before? Not ones where you've been able to do it for a while, particularly strong place in your business, but areas where you have shown progress would be great.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Where we have a very good result is in the Color area where for the full year last year we had both a good volume momentum and very good price\/mix momentum. So there we clearly have been able to achieve it. So, I would say that's the highlight.","In terms of the Fragrance area, it's still an area where we need to improve from a discount and allowances point of view as well as on the Body Care. Skin Care is not really an issue, either. So, the challenge for us is really is in Fragrance and is in Body Care.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just along the lines of your expectation for a little bit, for building cadence of growth. Do you guys think that Fragrance will grow on a like-for-like basis for the year in 2016?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to make any commitments on that at this stage of the game. So, we have some clear plans in place. But like I said, we're looking for a very gradual shift from a top line point of view for the total company largely driven by power brands. But beyond that, I'm not making any comments.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from Steph Wissink from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. We have two questions. Just the first with respect to the legacy celebrity fragrances business that you referenced earlier. Can you talk a little bit about that contract cycle? Is there any opportunity in the next few years should you retire or exit some of those legacy fragrances that are no longer relevant to the portfolio?","And then, separately, with respect to the Color Cosmetics business, are you willing just to give us any more detail behind the makeup versus the nail care side, just looking at those two sub-categories, can you talk a little bit about the performance there? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. In terms of celebrity fragrances, this was a segment within the category which was very popular a number of years ago, and which has kind of seen its hay day and now is not very much in vogue either with consumer or with the trade. And as a result, we are seeing a gradual erosion basically of this business. It's a highly profitable business because the investments are not always huge in this area. So, it would be very difficult to divest it and to make sense out of it for shareholders. So, it is better to keep it than to divest it.","Your second point in terms of the Color Cosmetics category that category is doing very, very well both on the nail as well as on the general Color Cosmetics side. Clearly, the big brands in this area are Sally Hansen, OPI and Rimmel. We've seen basically OPI basically doing very well despite the fact that we've taken out from wholesale business; Sally Hansen clearly is on fire, as I already alluded to; and Rimmel is also gaining share across the globe. So I would say this business overall is doing very, very well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Astrachan from Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning everybody. Bart, had a couple of sort of pointed questions, so sort of apologies how it'll come out. But you lost a number of key executives in recent months, some four fairly substantial executives by my count. I guess I'm curious why it is timing-wise ahead of what seems like a fairly exciting time in the history of the company. And then sort of what are your plans for moving forward with increasing the bench strength? And I guess sort of related to that, has the combining of the prestige and mass businesses impacted the ability to attract or retain talent? And so how do you think about all of that? I realize there's a lot of moving parts there.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","So I would say we are in a process of transforming the business and that includes basically transforming the capabilities of the company and that at times might involve changing the management team. And so I would really look in this regard more towards what will happen going forward with the merger with Procter. We are looking very much forward to combining the business, the Coty business with the Procter business, and to strengthen the overall capabilities and the management team of the combined entity. And I think there is a wealth of talent on both sides which should allow us to do that. So I think basically going forward, you should expect to see a very strong management team on the combined entity. That's certainly my target.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So as you think about it going forward, it sounds then like it's more promote from within including folks coming over from the Procter side as opposed to potentially looking externally?","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","No. I will never have 100% internal basically movement. We will also attract some talent from outside still. So as you think about the combined entity, yes, the bulk clearly will come from the Procter and the Coty side, but there might, we might complement it with a number of candidates from outside. As I'm interim CEO and at some point in time, I will basically move back into my Chairman position, I want to make sure that this business is in tip-top shape and my first priority therefore is to make sure that I have a very strong management team in place that can manage the combined entity. And as you can imagine, that's my number one priority over the next couple of months, is to make sure we get there.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning everyone. My question has to do with the cadence of savings versus investment. I understand that the reinvestment to provide top line growth is going to be slower, but you got to prepare for a merger that is going to double the size of the company in a year. So, when the investment for the staffing and the capabilities that you need to build is going to happen so that the company is ready to accommodate the Procter business within a year, is that investment coming out of fiscal 2016 numbers? How you're going to basically work that out? Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Patrice?","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, Bart. So, Javier, thanks for the questions. So, the way that we think about that, as I've said already in the July call is, when we announced the P&G merger, is really the first year is going to be an investment year. So when you think about it, fiscal 2017, provided that we close in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2017 is going to be a year of investments. So, this is where we're going to start to build the capabilities. We need to make a couple of upfront investments in many different areas, IT is one of them, capabilities is another one. I have quoted a couple of example, like the hair care business, we need to step up on that one. In terms of North America, we are getting a mass business without the demand capabilities to be able to support it because these are the corporate sales force from P&G that are coming with the transaction.","So, we need to build these capabilities. So, I think the way you should look at it is that as far as the Global Efficiency Plan, we are planning to reinvest gradually this in order to start to regain momentum of the top line. As far as the pro forma Coty is concerned and the integration of the P&G Business is concerned, the way you should look at it is that fiscal 2017 will be a year of investments. And then fiscal 2018 and 2019 will be years where you will see all the savings coming through.","And it's worth noting that the $400 million out of the $550 million, the first $400 million are going to materialize immediately at closing because these are costs that are not transferred. So, when I speak about investment, I'm more referring to the $150 million of net savings, which is composed of two legs. First, the investment in year one. Second, year two and year three, some savings, and the net of these two are $150 million.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","But as a follow-up, if I'm understanding this correctly, basically, during fiscal 2016, you are now going to be making accommodations in terms of preparing the IT, capability and the staffing to get ready for the mergers. So, actually, Coty will be running at this through fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 is when all the investment and recruitment that essentially represent $400 million in cost for Procter is going to take place? And if you can help us understand what is, in your view, if Procter spend $400 million to run this business, what is the amount that you think you can run it with? $100 million, $50 million, what is that investment? If you can quantify that investment for us, that would be very helpful.","Patrice de Talhou\u00ebt - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","So, I think great questions. So, in terms of, when we spoke about the one-time cost which is $900 million to be able to step up the organization, there is $400 million of CapEx. Some of these CapEx \u2013 and there is more to come because we need \u2013 we are in the process of meeting with the transition team, formalizing everything, but some of these CapEx will happen in fiscal 2016 because if you think about it just from an IT standpoint, we need to start to prepare ourselves to be able to support a $10 billion business. So, we are not going to start this in fiscal 2017.","And also, the way you should think about that is that we have \u2013 we are going to close in the middle of the calendar year, fiscal 2016, plus or minus one quarter, depending on the regulatory issues. And we have some limited duration for the TSA. So we need to make sure that we are ready to operate as soon as closing. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, we are going to incur some of the costs in fiscal 2016.","It's the same for the one-time cost, sort of the other $500 million, in terms of prepare the organization, and especially if you think about the North American organization, support the mass business coming from Procter, we will need to build the capabilities beforehand.","So now, in terms of the latter part of the question, I think it's a little bit too early to be able to answer that. I think more to come. In the coming earnings, we will be able to give you a little bit more color and precision and granularity on the phasing of the savings.","Operator","Thank you.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Sir, I'm not showing any questions at this time.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session.","Bart Becht - Chairman & Interim Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Well, thank you, all for attending the call. And hope to basically talk to you in about three months time. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

My name is Maria, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, February 5, 2020.","On today\u2019s call are Pierre Laubies, Chief Executive Officer; and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse, Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that many of the comments today may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to Coty\u2019s earnings release and their reports filed with the SEC where the company lists factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.","All commentary on like-for-like net revenue reflect the comparison of the business at constant currency in the current and prior year, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations reflect certain adjustments as specified in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our earnings release. You can find the bridge from GAAP to non-GAAP results in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Laubies.","Pierre Laubies","Thank you, Maria. And welcome, everybody, to Coty\u2019s second quarter fiscal \u201820 conference call. I will start by reviewing the progress we have made on our turnaround plan in the last few months. Pierre-Andr\u00e9 will then discuss our financial results, outlook, our newly introduced sustainability target and some of the recent strategic developments.","Exactly one year ago, I was sharing with you and our key leaders my first impressions of Coty. My first impression at the time was that we had reserves of performance to unlock in the way we ran our company and that the path to building a bigger business would have to go through building a better one.","Our turnaround plan has been underway now for two quarters, and we are beginning to see clear evidence of progress in the key parts of the business. Like we alluded about it six months ago, our key priorities over these last two quarters have been, rebalance working media and nonworking media, grow penetration by advertising our brands at scale with the right media mix, improve our gross margins by managing better our mix, price and promotion level, put together an organization more adequate with our size, find the right balance between discipline and creativity in everything we do, deliver consistent financial performance in a quality way.","I am very happy to report that our teams across our business units, factories and corporate centers have been doing just that. We are, of course, far from having solved all the challenges that we face and seize all the opportunities ahead of us, yet we can see that we are on the right track, that our plans are starting to work and that now is the time for us to be consistent and persistent.","This allow us to reconfirm our fiscal \u201820 targets. At the same time, we are beginning our work to reshape our portfolio to both provide financial flexibility and raise our growth potential. We will come back to that.","I will take now the opportunity to concretely illustrate our approach by sharing some details of our turnaround plan activation. We continue to grow our working media spend, which was up 8% in the quarter, as we focus on investing behind our priority brand-country combination. The media spend behind these priority businesses in Consumer Beauty grew over 15% in the first half of the year.","We also continued to refine the mix between traditional and digital media, activating digital-first campaigns in our younger-orientated brands while ramping up TV media behind our more mainstream brands.","Our organization is very intentional in driving strong gross margin improvement, activating the levers at the center of our strategy. We have implemented list price increase in a handful of countries with a broader deployment on track for the second half.","Each of our divisions have been actively managing the mix of their sales, prioritizing higher-value products and channels. We are continuing to monitor that we have the best possible alignment between sell-in and sell-out, thus avoiding value-restrictive selling tactics.","Finally, we are advancing on our objective to be a leaner and more aligned organization, supported by an enabling culture with the right balance of creativity and discipline. The new organizational structure has been deployed effective January 1, and the teams are now working under a new regionally focused framework.","We have stepped up our service level to our customers, whilst at the same time, increasing our forecast accuracy. And we have begun to execute on our fixed cost restructuring program.","As part of our efforts to be the healthier business, we are steadily restoring the pricing architecture of our brand and premiumizing our portfolio, and we are making strong progress within both Consumer Beauty and Luxury.","In Consumer Beauty, the average net revenue per unit in the past six months has increased by approximately 2% with even higher growth in Europe. This has been achieved through a combination of implementing net price management in a few countries, although the bulk of the effort will be deployed in the second half, active revenue management as we have prioritized and supported higher-value products, and more disciplined promotional activity while remaining competitive in the marketplace.","In Luxury, while we are starting from a stronger position, we are also capturing premiumization opportunities. The average selling prices increased by approximately 4% with improvement in each of our top three markets.","The driver for this expansion includes, reduced promotional activity, improved mix management, including greater emphasis on eau de parfums, and reduced gift set activity, and selective price management.","Last quarter, we shared with you early progress in some of our priority brand-country combinations. With that progress continuing to build across a number of brands and market, I am pleased to offer the global view on our end market performance.","As you can see on this slide, the global mass color cosmetic market, as tracked by Nielsen, has decelerated moderately over the past year. In our Q2, the mass color cosmetics market declined by approximately 3% compared to a decline of 2% for the last 12 months.","At the same time, our focus on sales and marketing fundamentals has allowed us to improve our global sell-out by approximately 130 basis point, even in a slowing market backdrop.","The improved sell-out plan in our cosmetic brand reflects strong progress in the U.K. with Rimmel and Max Factor, in Germany with Max Factor and in Australia with Sally Hansen and Rimmel.","It is worth highlighting that the action plans we have activated in the U.K. behind Rimmel, including substantial increase in working media, support on halo sub-brands, and a couple of strong launches, has allowed Rimmel to grow its penetration, hence, its market share of the U.K. cosmetics market by recruiting light and medium shoppers, exactly in line with our strategic intent.","Our sell-out performance in the U.S. are more mixed, though our underperformance gap relative to the category has been moderating in total and very positive on our core franchises. Some of these drivers of underperformance are due to external factors like competitive promo pressure. We can only live with those.","But some are also in our control, and we are taking the necessary steps to correct - the necessary corrective action, sorry. It is important to highlight that due to the strong momentum we are driving on Amazon, our U.S. cosmetic sell-out is over 100 basis points better than what is captured in the Nielsen data.","Complementing the gradual improvement of our performance in store is the continuing strong growth in our e-commerce sales. In the first half of our fiscal \u201820, Luxury e-commerce revenues grew by approximately 20% year-on-year. E-commerce now accounts for a low double-digit percentage of our Luxury business, which is relatively consistent with the Luxury fragrance market.","This momentum was achieved despite the currently limited presence on Tmall. However, our conversations with our leading licenses about launching on Tmall are progressing well, and we are optimistic about the long-term opportunity for our Luxury business with this leading e-retailer.","In Consumer Beauty, while e-commerce penetration is still relatively low, we continue to make great strides globally. Our first half e-commerce revenue grew by approximately 20% fueled by strength on Amazon. Our cyber weekend sales on Amazon in the U.S. and in the U.K. nearly doubled versus the prior year.","In fact, in our core markets, including the U.S., U.K. and Germany, we are gaining market share on Amazon, speaking to the strength time of our color cosmetics brand when combined with disciplined focus on e-commerce fundamentals.","While we continue to strengthen our base business, I\u2019m pleased to announce the expansion of some of our leading brands into the clean beauty segment. It is evident that consumers are increasingly focused on wellness, both their own and of the world around them. This is driving rapid growth for products and brands that serve these dual needs, and we will seize this opportunity.","After an initial move in our Professional Business with the WeDo launch, and as we have chosen to focus on our core categories of fragrances, cosmetics and skin care in the last couple of months, we have launched clean label product line in each of these categories, Philosophy\u2019s Nature In A Jar, Sally Hansen\u2019s Good. Kind. Pure., Calvin Klein, CK Everyone, and COVERGIRL\u2019s Clean Fresh are each vegan, cruelty-free, based on naturally derived ingredient and free of many contested ingredients. Nature In A Jar and CK Everyone are also packaged in recyclable packaging composed of post-consumer recycled material.","We are very proud of the teams who are driving these efforts and capitalizing on the growing trend while building Coty\u2019s reputation as a company that aims to do great by doing good.","With that, let me turn over to Pierre-Andr\u00e9.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Thank you, Pierre, and good morning, everyone. About sustainability. Sustainability is about, as Pierre just mentioned, consumer and innovation, but it\u2019s also about more than that.","For the past few years, the Coty teams have been working in a number of areas to try and catch up with the industry. And while a lot of things remain to be done, the many progresses which we have made so far have made it possible for us to elaborate the first Coty sustainability platform and to make it public today.","So I will not go into the many details present on the chart, but I would just say that we have chosen to call it Beauty that Lasts and that it encompasses initiatives in the area of products, environment protection and people and diversity. And for each of them, we have defined priority initiative and set targets for ourselves which we will monitor transversally.","So for instance, we will, by 2022, source 100% of our Indian mica from responsible sources. Or we will, by 2030, reduce our carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 30%. And there are more on the page.","This platform will further build our credibility as we deliver against these targets. It will also increasingly give us the ability to take initiative in a market segment which will be one of the growth drivers of beauty in the coming years, and therefore, this is a major step for us.","But now let\u2019s zoom again to short term and let me turn to the earnings of the quarters. As said by Pierre, this was a quarter in line with the strategic plan. And this is the fifth time in a row, it is the case since Pierre and I have started this exercise more than a year ago, evidencing, I believe, an improved control over our business.","On revenues more specifically. Q2 was modestly down at 1.4% with noticeable sequential improvement in Consumer Beauty. Beyond the percentage change, the evolution of our top line has been on quality, with strong improvements on that front evidenced by the increase of our gross margin.","So turning to the divisions and to start with Luxury. In Q2, we launched the second pillar under Tiffany fragrances called Tiffany & Love, which you have on the left side of the chart. It performed incredibly well in market. This launch confirmed the appeal of the Tiffany brand for both males and females and has driven market share gains for the overall Tiffany brand across the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Canada and Italy.","Our continued support and activation behind Marc Jacobs Daisy has now firmly placed the iconic fragrance pillar into the top 4 fragrances in the U.S., in the U.K. and Canada, and we continue to drive growth across our focus brands, Burberry and Hugo Boss.","Moving to Slide 11. On the performance side, Luxury delivered a solid growth at 1.3% on a high comparison base. I remind you that the same quarter last year was plus 10%. This was helped by the previously mentioned innovations but also by the strong performance of our Gucci makeup.","While the traction of our brands remains strong, we are, as we have been doing in Consumer Beauty, working to improve the quality of the top line. This has already led us to reduce the level of promotions and discounts. We will, in Q3, take advantage of our new go to market, by region common to Consumer and Luxury, to accelerate our work and cut low-value sales, decrease value distribution, better control the gray market, amongst other initiatives. This will temporarily drive our sell-in into low single-digit negative in Q3 specifically.","At the same time, our sell-out will be supported by a strong innovation pipe with CK Everyone coming in Q3, coming today, I believe; as well as Hugo Boss Alive, both fragrance for women, and later in the year, the expansion of the Gucci makeup range; and other innovations, including Burberry, Marc Jacobs or Hugo Boss. So Luxury definitely remains a key growth engine for our company.","Let\u2019s now turn to Consumer Beauty, Page 12. The launch of Rimmel Lasting Matte foundation has been off to a great start. This is on the left. In core markets like the U.K., we have been supporting this launch with a strong uplift in media and in store activation, which have driven growth for the entire Rimmel Lasting sub-brand and contributed to Rimmel market share gains in the U.K. over the last five months.","Consistent with our focus on high-value business, we have been activating support behind our premium Sally Hansen Miracle Gel line, including major investments and innovative try-on features in select retailers. This has driven mid single-digit revenue growth for Miracle Gel in the U.S. in Q2, supporting the overall brand.","And finally, on the right, for Max Factor, we are continuing to strengthen the product range with a Miracle Touch Second Skin hybrid foundation, which contains pre and probiotics to support skin renewal and is capitalizing on the growing consumer demand for skincare-like cosmetic products.","Performance-wise, going to Slide 13, Consumer Beauty continued showing progresses as illustrated by Pierre a few minutes ago. While North America continued to show a mixed performance with a solid delivery from Sally Hansen but continued weakness of COVERGIRL, Europe kept strengthening with Rimmel in the U.K. or Max Factor in Germany. And in ALMEA, we kept being selective in our efforts in an attempt to continue improving the quality of our sales.","Our priority combo, brands-country, evidence that their updates are delivering. And while the overall top line of the division remains below where we would like it to be, it is clearly showing sequential progresses at minus 6.8%, more than one point versus last quarter, and the best performance for the past 18 months, and this is obviously to be continued.","And turning to Professional Beauty, Slide 14. ghd continues to grow at a very strong pace, driven in part by the launch of the Glide hot-brush. In our leading Wella brand, we have strengthened the range with the launch of ColorMotion+, a hair care regimen that improves color of hair quality. And last, OPI continues in the - invigorates, sorry, the assortment with its latest Mexico City color collection, which you see on the right.","And so moving to Slide 15, Professional Beauty continued growing in Q2 at 2.2% for the quarter, which means first half at 3.5%. All regions growing, Europe and the U.S. delivering a steady performance while ghd continued delivering strong growth, helped by continued innovation. At the same time, the margins remain high in the 70s - in the 17s, sorry.","These number talk for the health of the business and the quality of the PB teams, the Professional Beauty teams. So at the time, we are working full speed in parallel on the strategic review, I\u2019ll come back to it.","So I will now get back to Coty overall, Slide 16. Looking at the profitability for the entire group, we are now well anchored in our virtuous equation. Gross margin was up 130 basis points to 63.4%, reflecting progresses coming from mix, price, but also channel management.","At the same time, we kept increasing the support behind our brands with working media up high single digits and key brands being advertised at efficiency. In front of that, we continue to be more selective on promos.","Together with a tight control of our fixed cost, this has fueled strong improvement of our operating margin to 13.9%, up 110 basis points, and this flowed down to the EPS, which is up $0.03 to $0.27, half of it driven by a onetime tax benefit.","So we showed good progresses on the earnings side, but even more so on the free cash flow side, Slide \u201817, with a $364 million free cash flow for the second quarter alone, almost double that of last year.","This was driven by tight control in all lines with a specific contribution of receivable, we have been reducing the overdues; and the inventories, thanks to a better supply chain working, a better service level and better S&OP process.","Our debt closed at $7.2 billion, down from $7.4 billion the pre-year quarter - the previous quarter, sorry. And free cash flow continues, of course, to be very high on our agenda.","So to sum up, Slide 18. This was a quarter very much in line with expectations on all line. It allows us to reaffirm our target for the year, with the delivery expected to be skewed towards Q4, like-for-like net revenue stable to slightly down year-on-year, adjusted OI growing 5% to 10% like-for-like, with a strong working media reinvestment, and adjusted EPS growing mid-single digit and implements of our free cash flow.","I\u2019ll move to Slide 19 now and would like to give you some last comments regarding the change of scope we are currently driving to complement our turnaround plan and build a stronger Coty.","On the strategic review first. We are very happy with the way things are going. First and foremost, as you have seen, the business keeps delivering well. This was the case in Q1 and is very much the case in Q2 in Professional Beauty and across the businesses under review, and we expect this to continue going forward. It\u2019s a clear testimony of the quality of the business under review as well as the quality and commitments of the teams running it.","We continue running the process and have now moved into a more concrete phase. The information memoranda having been distributed to the interested parties, we continue seeing many strong marks of interest and keep working with an unchanged time frame with a decision to be made by summer 2020.","Moving to Slide 20. Kylie is a second topic. As you have seen, we have closed the deal on the 6th of January and soon appointed Christoph Honnefelder as the CEO. The business has continued delivering well in the last month of 2019, actually ahead of expectation, given strong skin care starts and strong Black Friday overall.","We will consolidate Kylie globally as of the acquisition date, early January \u201820. However, we will report sales and margin, the scope change, this is - instead of as part of the like-for-like performance for the first 12 month. We will use this time to define the right sequence of initiative to accelerate the brand starting from calendar \u201821.","Our first interactions and thoughts confirm the potential we were seeing in the brand at the time of signing, and we will take the time to get things right before pushing and delivering our objective, which is, I remind you, to bring an additional one point of top line to the group. Finance why - finance-wise, sorry, we will therefore just make sure in \u201820 that this transaction is EPS neutral for the calendar year.","Moving to Slide 21, and this is going to be the last one, a few words of recap on this call before we move to Q&A. As detailed by Pierre, our turnaround is progressing well. Whether on the top line, OpEx, on the cost side, we start seeing the benefits come in.","Part of the benefits, 2 KPIs are showing strong progresses and they are important: Gross margin, on the one hand, which talks of the quality of our top line and business; and the free cash flow, which is a proxy for the comprehensive business delivery. We will continue focusing very much on these KPIs.","As a result, we are confident in our ability to reach our target for the year and we\u2019re happy to reaffirm them. We are also happy with the progresses made on the shaping of our portfolio and with each of the strategic review and the partnership with Kylie Jenner.","As you may sense, we are dealing with a very intense value-creation and transformation agenda. If we manage to drive it and show so many progresses, this is thanks to the Coty teams who have been and keep showing talent, energy, courage and resilience. And on behalf of Pierre and myself, the two of us, I would like to conclude by thanking each and all of the Coty associates for this performance.","And now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong of Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Good morning. First, just wanted a little bit more on the strategic review because there wasn\u2019t a ton more information just like three months later. So just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail.","And then is this - is the planned move of professional hair in Brazil in any way influencing the timing of any projects you might embark on with respect to cost and efficiency improvements, free cash flow improvements that you plan to make? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Hi. This is Pierre-Andr\u00e9. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m going to be able to give elements about the timing. So maybe just to - yes, just to repeat. We have started the process back in October. We took the time to prepare the information and to have everything we need to be able to run a smooth process. We are running the smooth process as from now. We took the time to make sure that we find the best possible solution for the business, but also for Coty shareholders.","Obviously, we are very comfortable with the timing we gave as an indication at the beginning, which is by summer \u201820 in terms of decision. But of course as you can imagine, to run this smooth process, we just have to do it in quiet manner. So we\u2019ll come back to you in due course with more elements. But for the moment, I just can tell you that things are proceeding really as we expected and well.","On the impact on restructuring cost, well, there\u2019s two elements. We don\u2019t foresee - I don\u2019t foresee any change to what we have said so far. Because on the one hand, we will have - I mean Professional Beauty and Brazil, we\u2019re carrying part of the cost, and they are going to leave, so these costs are not going to be incurred by us.","But on the other one, we think we have to make some further adjustment to the business to reach the same level of profitability. We are working on that. And therefore, all together, I expect the same $600 million figure to remain our envelope of restructuring cost as announced before.","Olivia Tong","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. If I could follow up on the price contribution of 4%. That\u2019s pretty healthy. Presumably it\u2019s primarily in Consumer Beauty, but can you talk about your process of deciding what pricing levers to pull, and how much more you think there is to go there?","Pierre Laubies","So I\u2019ll take - this is Pierre speaking. Our - the contribution actually is pretty balanced between Consumer Beauty and Luxury. Our objective is very clear. I mean, we do have a gross margin gap that we want to close, and price - and I mean, in that case, I actually talked mostly about net price is one of the key drivers to enable us to do that.","So our objective is very clearly on that case. Yes, we do want to participate into promotion, but at an acceptable level and not necessarily at an over-intense level. Why? Because again, it needs to come back to - we need to drive fundamentally the penetration of our brand. And for that, we need the margin to invest. And therefore, we need to break this cycle.","And so there are more to come. We will continue to refine all of that. There is more to come in the short term because we are deploying this strategy in more markets than we have been doing so far. So, so far, we have been focusing on four, five, six key markets. Now going forward, we\u2019re expanding the strategy.","And again, this requires a degree of granularity which is very fundamental. Taking a blanket approach is not very helpful in this situation because you have local competitive situation, you have mix which varies by market, point of departure is different a bit by market. So you exactly need the granularity of the market analysis.","And so yes, there will be more to come. And I do not desire to disclose what it is, but clearly, we will continue on this agenda. And once we have started this first one, we will make sure we stay on it for the next years and don\u2019t fall back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. Two questions on the U.S. business. First, can you talk a little bit about your exposure to Macy\u2019s? There was obviously some announcements of some closures there, 125 stores.","And then tied to that, you spoke a lot about your progress in e-commerce, maybe a little bit in terms of what you\u2019re doing with the specialty stores?","And then thirdly, we\u2019re going through the resets now in terms of the mass market. Some of that data is going to start showing up. How do your - how does your shelf space look going forward? Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","Okay. So on Macy\u2019s, we do expect the exposure to be very limited. And for us in Luxury, so we don\u2019t feel very - that the impact is going to be big. The question, the second question was?","Robert Ottenstein","On the specialty channel with Ulta and Sephora.","Pierre Laubies","Yes. Well, I think we are - our share on Ulta and Sephora in the Luxury business is on the - is doing well. And we are doing better than - we keep growing and we keep growing on e-commerce, too. And also, we know that on Ulta, we have some good result with COVERGIRL.","So again, we are taking our fair share of that market for the balance of the business that we have. So we see that this is really a channel that we want to continue to push and we want to continue to develop.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","And maybe on Ulta, before Pierre takes over on the shelves. As I was saying, Kylie has been doing spectacularly well at the end of \u201819, better than we expected. And that\u2019s been, for a part, with Ulta, of course. Both, by the way, in cosmetic and in skin care. And your next question was about the expectation on the reset of the shelf.","Pierre Laubies","Well, I think we have been working very hard and - on managing the productivity and increasing the productivity of our shelf. And I think our customers are happy with our result. And the reset, we have nothing to add to what we have already said in August. We anticipate this is exactly in line with where we are today with a slight decline, occasional slight decline.","But basically speaking, we should start exit - we should start, at the end of Q3, exiting the, we call it, major impact on distribution losses that we have experimented over the quarter last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks. Good morning.","Pierre Laubies","Morning, Lauren.","Lauren Lieberman","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Luxury and that you\u2019d specifically talked about the route-to-market changes. So if you could just elaborate on that, it\u2019d be very interesting.","And then more specifically, why the exit of the lower-value sales would only be an issue in 3Q. Because I would - just the way that my head was thinking about it, it would be something that would sort of linger for a year. So if you can explain a little bit more about that, it would be great. Thanks.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Sure. I\u2019ll take it - or Pierre, you want to?","Pierre Laubies","No, I can take the Luxury and route-to-market changes and you can also...","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yes. So maybe I take it on your specific question on the timing. Actually - fundamentally, we have the same goal in - throughout the company and throughout - in particular business we are going to retain, which are Luxury and Consumer Beauty. We\u2019ve been starting very much in Consumer Beauty to be more selective about some sales and cutting some sales. We\u2019ve made mention of that in ALMEA in particular. And by doing so, we\u2019ve been able to reduce the gray market. And we believe that\u2019s very important to drive up C1 [ph] to reduce the impact on our main markets and to make sure that we focus on the right particular top line.","We\u2019ve done already some things on Luxury, as shown by Pierre. But now we\u2019re going, in Q3, to go deeper in Luxury for one reason, which is that we have a common go-to-market, as you know, starting from Q3, between Luxury and Consumer Beauty. And therefore, it makes sense for us to do it now. And do it now means just cutting low-value distribution sales, promotion going a bit deeper. Because we know that we have a big pipe of innovation coming and we want to be able to focus on these innovations as opposed to [ph].","So in Q3, we\u2019ll accept that this has an impact on the sell-in and it\u2019s driving actually our sell-in into negative territories. But because we believe this is what we need to do to continue strengthening Luxury and continue making it a strong engine of growth for the company. And Pierre, you probably...","Pierre Laubies","I will add another point on the Luxury route-to-market changes or Consumer Beauty route-to-market change. Actually, we are not touching the customer-facing personnel. And we are still having dedicated marketing team. We are still having dedicated sales team at every market level.","The thing that we are doing is that we are taking advantage of our relatively - or we are facing the fact that we are, in some markets, that we need administrative scale and we need to support scale. And that\u2019s what we are doing fundamentally from the route-to-market change. We are combining our back office infrastructure. But we are not changing the customer-facing personnel and the structure of our marketing teams at the local level.","Lauren Lieberman","Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then just on the U.S. shelf space conversation. I understand that when we get to the end of 3Q, we start to cycle the losses, so just the comparisons will start to benefit. But do you have visibility into incremental shelf space? Or is this really more about just better productivity of what you do you have currently?","Pierre Laubies","I think we will probably, hopefully, gain some incremental shelf space as we are working hard on our productivity, but I\u2019ll just can\u2019t commit to that at this stage, all right? And I think at the end of the day, as you say, our objective was to clearly regain the confidence of our customers through our strategies and our focus, and that\u2019s what we are doing at this stage, all right?","And so that\u2019s job - we need to complete the job number one. It\u2019s very mission-critical for us that we, again - we gain confidence of our customers. And after that, we can start about expanding. And I think if we want to expand, we need to expand meaningfully through a combination of innovation of portfolio buildup and not only just continue to stretch the current business that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC.","Nik Modi","Good morning, everyone. I guess just two quick questions for me. Just wanted to get an update on any progress that you\u2019ve made in China. I know that\u2019s been an area that has been of high interest in terms of generating better business there.","The second question really is on the makeup side. I mean, it\u2019s been several quarters now, things seem to be getting worse. I mean, do you have a better handle on exactly what is driving the [Technical Difficulty]?","Pierre Laubies","Hello? Okay. So I mean, on China, we are very happy with the momentum in Luxury, all right? And I\u2019m sure you are still on, Nik. So - and so in our view, we keep progressing and we are happy. And particularly, the expansion into cosmetics have really driven incremental sales, which is, I think, a very good indication of the type of strategy that we want to do, partition coverage or with the same brand.","And I think many of our brands have the right to play into more categories than they do play today. And we will - we have demonstrated that with cosmetics in Gucci. So that\u2019s the big learning that we will capitalize on.","On makeup, I think that the combination of makeup, and I assume that you are a bit probably driving and talking about the U.S. market makeup and the reason for the decline.","Nik Modi","Yes.","Pierre Laubies","Yes. Actually, there is - there are many driving forces for that. And I would say that the structural forces, I would say, has been, first, an explosion of availability of new brands in a market which is very important to novelty has probably driven a level of stock at the consumer level. So that\u2019s one, probably, driver.","The second driver is that I think that many retailers have given - and we have some data, we\u2019ve demonstrated that, has given - particularly mass retailer, had given a lot of shelf space to new brands which do not have the necessary productivity. And therefore, unfortunately, it - and they have been subsidizing that space by taking away from big brands. So that has probably driving the penetration of the mass cosmetic market.","And three, I think there is possibility - there is most likely a bit of a shift from make - or consumer shift from makeup to skincare, and we observed that around the world. I would say these are, in my view, the three fundamental drivers. Some of it, we need to get - some of these trends, we need to capitalize on. And some of these trends, we need to have conversation with our customers about.","Nik Modi","Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities.","Joe Lachky","Thanks. So a couple of follow-ups. I guess first on Luxury. Given the negative growth in Q3, I understand you\u2019re pulling back on lower-value products, probably lower-margin products. But how will that impact operating income growth in the third quarter?","And then more broadly, when you think about the flow between the quarters in the back half, right, so overall, expecting pretty significant improvement in EPS growth. But Q3 is going to be pressured by the Luxury and not fully lapping distribution losses in Consumer Beauty. So should we expect operating income, EPS growth will be weighted more towards Q4 in the second half?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yes. It\u2019s Pierre-Andr\u00e9. That\u2019s correct. What I would say about - you\u2019ve seen that we reiterate our guidance. Obviously, we still have the same objective for the EPS, full year. You\u2019ve seen that we have - we are a bit ahead of what we thought what - where we expected to be at the end Q2.","For Q3, I would say that EPS is going to be broadly in line with that of last year. And therefore, you\u2019re right to say that the EPS progress are going to be skewed toward Q4, which is not impossible - by the way, given the seasonality of the business and the fact that regularly Q2 and Q4 are our bigger half.","Joe Lachky","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on the strategic review. So do you - as you\u2019re going through the deeper view of the businesses, do you have any more visibility on potential stranded overhead? And then also if you had any additional details on the tax basis of the assets and how much tax leakage we could expect to see in a sale? Thanks.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yes. I mean, limited answers, but you will understand that I cannot go much more - much ahead at this time. On the stranded cost, maybe the two examples I can repeat on that. A, taking into account credit cost, the average margin or the ballpark margin of the divested business is in the mid-teens. So that\u2019s one element.","The second element is that we have, in the initial announcement, reiterated our margin guidance which is 14% to 16% by 2023. And everything we see today confirms that we\u2019re working actually on strengthening further the plan to make sure that we have enough room to cover it, and for continuity, possibly to go further. But we definitely confirm the 14% to 16%. And then for the rest, I will get back to you when we have more elements, which depends, obviously, on the progresses of the process.","The second thing, about tax rate. We\u2019ve said that the tax rate would be the corporate tax rate, which is of Coty, which is in the low - sorry, we said that it would be below, and in fact, meaningfully below the corporate tax rate of Coty, which is in the low 20s.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Wissink of Jefferies.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Helen on for Steph Wissink. Thanks for taking our questions. Do you have any update on the travel retail channel quarter-to-date with the virus impacting travel itineraries? And then also if we could just get a little color on the softening of the Pro Beauty margins.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Sorry, a little color on the? Softening of the Professional Beauty margin. Well on that one, frankly speaking, I would not see this as material. Margins remain at a high level, in the 17%, which is not bad. That\u2019s with the performance of the top line, which is good. Gross margin, good.","So I would not read anything specific into it. The business keeps delivering. And it\u2019s going to be on track with its target. Actually delivered against its target internally on the sales side, and we expect it to continue for the second half.","On the travel retail, on the virus. One thing on the virus, first, is that obviously we care about people. So we have organized process internally with a view to make sure that our people are protected at all time and in the best possible conditions at all times. So we are extremely vigilant on that point, I imagine, as everyone.","Secondly, on the impact themselves, yes, there is, and there will be, impact on the travel retail because the amount of traveling is decreasing. I think it\u2019s far too early to quantify any impact. The only two things we are sure is that there will be an impact, first; and secondly, that the impact for Coty is going to be pretty small relative to competition since China represents only 3% of our sales.","And Asia, generally speaking, we are underweight. So this time is a bad for a good in this case. But we\u2019ll get back to you once we have more visibility. Again, for me today, it\u2019s far too much early days.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank.","Faiza Alwy","Hi, good morning. So a couple of questions for me. Firstly, I just wanted to talk about Kylie. Thank you for giving the calendar \u201819 number, that\u2019s really helpful. But you talked about preparing the company for rapid expansion and I was hoping to get a little bit more color around that. Is it - I know you\u2019ve talked about expansion previously, but sort of how should we think about the timing of that expansion?","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Well again, a bit early to talk about that. Today, we are the 5th of February, so we closed less than a month ago. As you can imagine, these are not things you get into a rush to solve. The first thing we wanted to do was to set up the right sort of dialogue, having Christoph appointed, Christoph connecting with the teams locally.","And then we need to understand within what we had defined, how do we operationally move from the current setup to broadening the number of markets; to accelerating the penetration of skin care in the U.S., elsewhere; to understand the way we are going to lead the innovation process with them?","How Coty is going to be an asset to Kylie? This is very important. We don\u2019t want to integrate Kylie, we really want to give Kylie the ability to develop and to grow for the benefit of the shareholders, and the primary shareholder is obviously Kylie. How do we want to sequence things? So I think we need a bit of time to make that and to come back to you.","The focus this year is really on preparing the plan. We have high ambition. The ambition is to bring one point of growth to Coty overall between \u201821 and \u201823. So CAGR. This is ambitious. We may be able to do more. But for that, we need to get prepared and ready. And this is what is going to be the priority of the coming 6 to 12 months.","Faiza Alwy","Okay. Thanks\u2026","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Sorry. And the element, it\u2019s as you rightly pointed. Is that the traction is good? In fact, the traction in the last part of the year was even better than when we expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi. Thank you. Good morning and afternoon, there. So I have one question and a follow-up. First, hoping to - you can talk more about how should we model travel retail. And if you can remind us the percentage of total sales coming from China and the contribution of travel retail globally, even excluding - and especially now, excluding professional going forward, if you have that number.","And my follow-up is on the life post Professional Beauty and Brazil divestitures. Can you please confirm? You just reaffirmed the 14% to 16% EBIT margin goal by fiscal 2023. I know it\u2019s long - it\u2019s a long-term guidance. But is it considered in stranded costs, both divestments? And how should we be thinking in 2021?","I\u2019m assuming that there is a timing to which you rightsize the company to the new sales profile. So how long should we think about margins going down in the first moment in 2022 - in \u201821? Sorry. And then getting back to that goal by 2022 and 2023? Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Okay. I\u2019ll take the second question. Maybe I\u2019ll let Pierre answer the first one. On the second one...","Pierre Laubies","Maybe I\u2019ll do the first one, in any case. So travel retail is about 15% of Luxury, all right? So that gives you a bit of the modeling. So that\u2019s about, therefore, 5% of - I would say 7% of the company globally.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Okay. From a...","Andrea Teixeira","And travel retail - I\u2019m sorry, travel retail in globally, how much is it currently?","Pierre Laubies","I said 15% of the Luxury business.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","That\u2019s global. And if you want specifics, Asia is about one third of that.","Andrea Teixeira","One third of that. Good to know.","Pierre Laubies","And China overall is 3% of the company.","Andrea Teixeira","Okay. Thank you.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Yes. And on the 14% to 16%, again I repeat we\u2019ve written, and I reiterate it, we are definitely very confident in our ability to deliver it. That was part of the turnaround plan. We have given - the part of the initiative we called, which is in the remaining perimeter, the additional opportunities we have. The pace of delivery of the plan, 14% to 16%, was and remain our objective for RemainCo [ph] for the margin by 2023.","Now the real question is what is the path to it? And that\u2019s where I need a bit of time to be able to answer you. We\u2019re working on it. We have two questions, which is what level of margin can we expect for \u201821? And what level of EPS can we expect for \u201821? There are a lot of moving parts and moving pieces, including the price, including as well the use of proceeds and the return to shareholders, including the structure. And so we\u2019re working on that. And when we have enough visibility on all these elements, we\u2019ll get back to you with an answer.","Pierre Laubies","May I add that we are already anticipating, definitely, in our staffing, particularly at corporate headquarter level, that possibility. And therefore are taking already preventive action to avoid us to create a future problem by rightsizing our future organization right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Reuter of Bank of America.","William Reuter","Good morning. I just have two. The first is, you didn\u2019t talk about leverage at the end of the asset sale. Do you still expect to be at three times once that\u2019s completed? And then you also talked about accelerating the growth of Kylie in calendar year \u201821. Do you expect that Kylie would be growing in calendar year \u201820 as well? That\u2019s all.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Well, on Kylie, frankly, that\u2019s not the topic. Given the current trends, it will be legitimate to expect growth. But at the same time, the priority will - is not going to be on the growth in \u201820, it\u2019s really going to be on selling up the growth for \u201821. So we won\u2019t be too much looking at that. But today, the asset is definitely growing.","On the leverage, yes, we said to be accurate and precise that we would target a leverage, post-deal, of approximately three times. And there is no reason for us at this stage to get away from that. This is our target and expectation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yeah, thanks. And morning, everybody.","Pierre Laubies","Morning.","Mark Astrachan","I wanted to ask about pricing just sort of broadly. So is this something that is now implemented strategically? Is this something that we should be thinking about contributing on a yearly basis going forward? And obviously not specific to what brand or categories, but is this now kind of part of the fabric of the company going forward?","And maybe if you could talk a bit about any thoughts on how you think about it just maybe across the categories of what will be left at the company, assuming the strategic review is complete, between Luxury and Consumer Beauty. And any sort of early learning\u2019s so far from key price thresholds? Thank you.","Pierre Laubies","Yes. I think overall, Mark, in the - clearly, you can call it pricing, I can call it value, too. I mean, at the end of the day, there are many ways to take pricing. There are, first, amount of business on deal, to depth of the deal, free balance between mainstream portfolio, premium portfolio.","Typically for instance, we do see, to give a bit of flavor for instance, that in Luxury, we are substantially overplaying in eau de toilette and underplaying in eau parfum. That is, basically speaking, one of the ways we will manage price or pricing. And you can it pricing, I call it value creation.","And so yes. Definitely, it is part of our strategic agenda to continue to push the value of our product set, right? There is one systemic plan, and I would call it like the long-lasting trend in consumer goods in general, and in beauty, even more, it\u2019s wealth. Markets up-trade systematically and we have a little bit of a catch-up job to do, but it is definitely one of our vision of innovation going forward.","Innovation for us going forward has two fundamental roles to play, one, it continues to enable us to premiumize the portfolio of the company, and two, enable us to increase the penetration of our brands. And sometimes, we can do both; sometime, we do one; sometimes we do the other.","But basically speaking, that\u2019s the way we are going to look at our innovation pipeline going forward. Does it contribute to improve the value of what we sell? Or does it give us more consumer? Or does it do both? All right?","And so it is a big shift, and I believe it is one of the substantial shift or systemic shifts, which at the end of the day transforms, energizes to do at the same time, better and bigger.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess my question is on your comments on Amazon, which I thought were really interesting in terms of the strength of your business there. Do you have a sense for why that is? I\u2019m curious that your brands have been doing so much better online than they are in mass retail.","I know you talked a little bit about some of the execution issues in mass retail. But are you doing anything different online? Are you paying for more visibility on Amazon, if you will?","And also, do you have a sense for your market share trends on Amazon? I\u2019m wondering if your sell-out in Amazon is better just because the category\u2019s doing really well on Amazon, or whether you, yourself are outperforming your peers in a more notable way? Thanks.","Pierre Laubies","On Luxury, we are. And on Consumer Beauty, we are gaining share in both categories, right? So we are happy with our development on e-retail.","The main reason why we are gaining share, honestly speaking, on Amazon and we are not gaining on Consumer Beauty mass is we are not losing distribution in Amazon. And I think fundamentally speaking, our brand is strong. They have the right to play and the right win in this channel. And what we have done is that we have clearly professionalized our sales.","Now we have taken online as a very serious channel, which is here to last, and our capabilities have been increased and our effort has been increased. And we are sharing our business plan with Amazon, and I think they are very happy with these plans because they see an opportunity for them to grow their own penetration whilst at the same time growing our own penetration.","And coming back to one of the early questions of Nik earlier over the trend of mass Consumer Beauty. There is also an element in the decline of Consumer Beauty that a lot of - some of the business is shifting to Amazon and is not picked up by Nielsen, too.","Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Terisse","Okay. So thank you all for following the call and for your questions. And we\u2019ll be seeing you on the road. Thank you, and have a good day. Bye-bye.","Pierre Laubies","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"6226":["Coty Inc.

My name is Tracy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to Coty's Second Quarter Fiscal 2014 Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Friday February 14. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Kevin Monaco, Coty's Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Mr. Monaco, please go ahead.","Kevin Monaco","Good morning. Thank you for joining us. On today's call are Michele Scannavini, Chief Executive Officer, and Sergio Pedreiro, former Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that many of our comments may contain forward-looking statements. Please refer to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Except where noted, the discussion of our financial results and our expectations do not reflect certain non-recurring and other charges, and the discussion of our revenue growth is on a like-for-like basis, therefore constitute non-GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release.","I will now turn the call over to Michele.","Michele Scannavini","Thank you, Kevin and good morning, everybody. Before I begin commenting on the business results, I want to take a minute to introduce the two new members of Equity Committee. Let\u2019s start with Patrice de Talhouet, who joined Coty team last month as Chief Financial Officer. Patrice brings with him more than 25 years of finance experience, having served in senior finance roles for a number of global corporations. He most recently served as Chief Financial Officer, Europe for Mars Chocolate and Corporate Financial Officer Americas for Mars. In these roles he oversaw governance and compliance in the Americas and successfully led a multi-year program to transform the global finance fashion. Specifically Patrice has a strong track record of driving efficiencies in each organization he has led. We\u2019re very excited to have Patrice on board and I believe that we will benefit from his expertise and drive to bring Coty to the next level of growth and profitability. Patrice couldn\u2019t be with us today but will be with me from the next call on.","We are also excited to welcome to our executive committee Catia Cesari. Catia joins us as the Senior Vice President, Business Development, Mergers and Acquisition. She brings to Coty 20 years of successful experience in M&A at global companies such as General Electric, Gucci Group and LABELUX. I believe that Catia\u2019s deep expertise and successful track record is scalping and executing highly strategic deals will be a strong asset in supporting Coty\u2019s long-term strategy. And I also to take a moment to thank Sergio Pedreiro, as this is his last earnings call with Coty.","Sergio joined Coty in 2009, in the mid of the global financial crisis and quickly implemented a strategy that supported our group, reduced cost and increased management focus on earnings and margin expansion resulting in significant improvement. Sergio also strengthens governance and compliance, and was instrumental in guiding Coty through its successful public offering last June. On behalf of this Equity Committee and the all organization, we are grateful for his great contribution over the last five years and we wish him well in his next venture.","Now let\u2019s talk of our quarterly results. The key market trends and business dynamics that impacted our first quarter results continued into the second quarter. This was largely anticipated and the quarter results came generally in line with our expectations. In the last few months we have seen a progressive cost structure slowdown in the fragrance market and further deceleration in the Mass cosmetic market, particularly in the nail category.","The fragrance market in the U.S. reported negative growth in the quarter, with a low single-digit decline in Prestige and high single-digit decline in the Mass channel. The holiday season has been generally softer than anticipated. [indiscernible] Trends [ph] announced the need to increase incentive and promotional activities to stimulate consumer purchases, and this had an impact on margins.","In Europe the fragrance market was generally flat versus last year though more promotional. The Mass color cosmetic market decelerated further in quarter two, particularly in the nail category. The U.S. nail category in the Mass channel declined 6% in the quarter following a 4% decline in Q1. As a reaction to this consumption slowdown, retailers have rapidly adjusted their inventory level. This destocking continued in quarter two, however to a lower extent than in quarter one.","Now, we believe that the big part of the inventory reduction should be over and we expect more marginal adjustment in the future in line with fluctuation in consumption. Against this backdrop, our second quarter revenues declined 4% on a like-for-like basis. This performance was a combination of positive 2% volume growth, more than offset by negative 6% price mix impact, reflecting the aggressive discount in the promotional activity we are facing in certain markets.","On a year-to-date basis, our revenues declined 3%. Our business in the Prestige channel grew with positive contribution from both the fragrance and skin care segments while our Mass business decreased, triggered by market consumption decline, particularly in the fragrance and nail market and unfavorable launch phasing.","Let\u2019s now examine more closely the quarterly trends in each of our segments. In fragrances our revenues declined 2% on a like-for-like basis. We maintained strong momentum in several of our power brands, such as Marc Jacobs, Chloe and Davidoff on the wins of successful launches in the first quarter. Also we received strong contribution from recently launched franchises such as Cavalli, which grew at a fast pace in Europe and Middle East and Katy Perry.","As we have previously discussed promotional activity in fragrances have been high over the holiday season, particularly in the Mass channel and 2% volume growth has been more than offset by adverse price mix impact. Also Q2 was impacted unfavorable launch phasing as last Q2 benefited from the very strong Lady Gaga launch, which did not repeat this year. Color cosmetic declined 9% on a like-for-like basis. This was driven by the decrease in nail as a result of negative category trends, high competitive activity and very difficult comps for Sally Hansen against last year Massive launch of the premium priced gel made kits.","Net of our nail product, our color cosmetic business had solid growth in the first half. While it is difficult to gage when the nail category will stand a decline, we are working to reestablish full competitiveness on our leading brand Sally Hansen.","As we have previously discussed, much of the growth in the nail category in the last couple of years was driven by the special effects subcategory, a new fashionable trend that pushed the whole category consumption up strong double-digits month after month. Sally Hansen led this trend with the string of surprising innovation, getting more than 50% market share in this particular segment of the U.S. market.","Now the wow effect of this trend is progressively fading. The segment is declining at a fast rate with Sally Hansen paying a heavy price, given its leading position in the subcategory. Going forward, we are focusing most of our future innovation on enhancing the performance of our core nail products. The strength of Sally Hansen in this field has been proven again in 2013 by the outstanding success of the new Salon Manicure line, which was most successful launch in the U.S. in the whole color cosmetic segment in Mass. We retained sales more than double those of the second best innovation of the year.","Rimmel continues to be a star performer with revenue growth meaningfully outpacing the Mass color cosmetic market trend in U.S. and Europe. The brand continues to gain share in the UK, in France, in Spain and U.S., where Rimmel is the fastest growing color brand among the top 10 in the color Mass market.","In skin and body care, revenues declined 2% like-for-like. The highlight of the skin and body care segment was Philosophy, which had solid growth for the third quarter in a row. The brand grew across all three channels including brick & mortar, QVC, and Philosophy.com. We are seeing this momentum, not only in the newly launched products such as Op - Energizer Night and the Time In A Bottle serum but also within the core franchises including Grace and Purity suggesting that the efforts of our team to reenergize the brand beginning to bear fruit.","Our expansion of the brand's international market, such as UK and Asia Pacific is also showing promising initial results. Adidas was in line with the previous year as growth in the U.S. and emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa was offset by continued softness in the European markets. We expect that the pipeline of innovations slated for the second half of the year will materially accelerate the growth of the brand.","As for Tjoy, in the last year we went through a reorganization of the management team, of the sales force and of the distribution organization. Recently we have also launched a new skincare line and together with the new management team we are closely monitoring the impact of all these [indiscernible].","In the meantime, we keep delivering strong result in China with Prestige fragrances and with Adidas, which deliver another quarter of double digit growth. As we speak we are launching a new Adidas shampoo in China as the third leg of the Adidas main line after shower gel and skincare.","Let\u2019s turn to our business by region. In EMEA, sales declined by 1% in the quarter and were positive 1% in the first half. While market conditions remained difficult in southern Europe we saw improved consumption trends in the UK and Germany over the holiday season, backed up by high promotion and discounting. We recorded solid growth in the emerging markets of the region such as Eastern Europe, South Africa and travel retail [ph].","In the Americas, our business was down 10% on a like for like basis. As discussed earlier this was fueled primarily by the U.S. Mass retail channel, which is low in demand in color cosmetic, particularly nail. On a positive note our emerging markets in the Americas delivered double digit growth, particularly thanks to our new joint venture and commercial partnership in Brazil.","In Asia Pacific, revenues grew 2% in the quarter and 4% year to date, primarily driven by strong pick up in Southeast Asia where we leverage our new structures. We continued to stay focused on our growth strategy and keep investing to progressively achieve our long term target to grow in line or better than the markets where we compete. One of the key pillars of our growth strategy is the acceleration of our development in the emerging markets.","Our effort to build or strengthen our structure in new markets has begun to pay dividends. In the first semester we grew 7% in emerging markets and significant contribution to the growth came from Brazil, Southeast Asia and South Africa, where we built new capabilities in the last few months. We expect to see a progressively greater impact from these markets as well from the recently announced new joint venture in the Emirates. The Middle East is a priority item for our growth strategy, considering the robust market growth and the strong culture for fragrance.","The new joint venture will enable us to strengthen our go to market capabilities in the United Arab Emirates, allowing us to fully leverage the potential of Coty\u2019s brand, particularly the Prestige fragrances. We are also targeting dispersion of our Mass brand in the market, including Rimmel and Adidas.","Looking now at the near term outlook, heading into the crowded quarter market condition remain challenging in several markets around the globe, particularly in the Mass channel. Despite this uncertainty, we keep targeting to return to top line growth in the second half, thanks to a competitive innovation plan, the increasing impact of our new structure in the emerging markets and continuous marketing investment to support our power brands.","Looking at our innovation plan, the focus will be on restoring growth in our color cosmetics segment, stemming the decline in our nail category and fully leveraging the strength of Rimmel. Speaking of nail, in Sally Hansen we are implementing a 360 degree program to increase competitiveness and come back to market share gains.","This program includes a modernization of the brand image through a new advertising campaign and in-store fixturing, an increase in marketing spending to enhance the visibility of the program and a robust innovation plan culminating in the launch of revolutionary [indiscernible] product by the summer time. We are expecting the brand decline to slow in the next quarter with growth returning in quarter four.","On OPI we are targeting robust growth in the second half, due to both product initiatives and distribution enhancement. On the product side we will have a string of very creative collection, including a special collection developed in partnership with Coca Cola supported by a strong digital plan.","OPI should also benefit from the full impact on this distribution with Sally Beauty in the U.S. and distribution and visibility gains in Europe and travel retail. In this context the recently announced acquisition of Lena White, the previous OPI distributor in UK plays an important role.","This acquisition will allow us to merge Lena White\u2019s strength and expertise in the professional channel with Coty capabilities in retail, significantly enhancing the reach and power of OPI in the UK, which is the second largest OPI market in the world.","Speaking now of Prestige fragrances, in the second half we have important initiative on Calvin Klein, including Endless Euphoria, CK One Red, and the 25th edition of Eternity, which are expected to re-boost our Calvin Klein business particularly in the U.S. Also we will roll out Rose de Chlo\u00e9 [ph] in the U.S. after successfully launching it in Europe in the fall.","In Mass fragrance, we are currently launching the new perfume from Beyonce called Beyonce Rise. It\u2019s worth also reminding that we have recently signed a new license agreement with the Spanish singer and entertainer Enrique Iglesias. This will help to expand our fragrance business, particularly in Brazil and to the Latin population, which is gaining an increasing share of total fragrance consumption in the U.S.","In skin and body care, we are targeting growth in the second half as we expect Adidas to progressively gain momentum with the launch of the World Cup inspired Get Ready line, as well as progressive expansion in the emerging markets. The novelty should also continue on this growth path, aided by the broad rollout of Time in a Bottle, new initiatives under the Miracle Worker franchise and further international expansion.","Importantly, to progress towards our long-term growth target we are not and we will not compromise on our strategic and long-term investment including market support of our color brands and building our structure in emerging markets, even at the expense of short-term profit gains. In the first half we increased our SG&A as a percent of sales, mostly due to higher marketing investment and the cost to build new subsidiaries in emerging markets.","At the same time we are working aggressively to gain efficiencies in our cost structure in consolidated markets. As a result we now expect to exceed our productivity program goal of $45 million saving by fiscal year \u201916 and accelerate the delivery of the majority of the efficiencies already in fiscal year \u201915. In a first changing environment it is extremely important to add effective management of working capital. I am pleased to report another strong quarter of efficiency gain in all the key areas of working capital management. This is the main contributor to our best in class performance in cash flow.","In the first six months of our fiscal year we generated $331 million in free cash flow, which represents 44% growth versus prior year. Our strong free cash flow and solid financial position have led us to announce a $200 million share repurchase program this morning. This program speaks to the Board\u2019s confidence in our business strategy and fundamental and aligns our commitment to generating shareholder value.","In summary Q2 was challenging and our results were in line with our expectations. We saw considerable strength in many of our power brands and across our businesses in emerging markets where we compete. We remain focused on executing our long-term strategy, including continue to invest behind our power brands driving innovation, accelerating our emerging market business and generating strong cash flow and we keep looking for ways to improve efficiencies in our cost structure. We believe that our focus and consistency on these priorities will allow us to come back to top line growth in the second half to progress versus our long-term target to grow in line with or better than the markets where we compete.","I will now hand the call over to Sergio, who will bring you through the key financial for the quarter","Sergio Pedreiro","Thank you Michele and good morning everyone. First I would like to remind all of you that my commentary today on our results and outlook include the discussion of adjusted results which excludes the impact of non-recurring items including private company share based compensation and restructuring cost. When applicable, I will also discuss our adjusted results at constant currency. This presentation is consistent with how we plan to report results and provide our outlook in future quarters. You can find the bridge from reported to adjusted results, including foreign exchange translation impact in the reconciliation tables in the earnings release.","As anticipated during our November first quarter earnings release call, we expected a challenging second quarter and overall results came in in line with our expectations. Our revenues declined 4% on a like-for-like basis. As Michele explained this is a reflection of continued weakness in the Mass channel in the U.S. nail category, unfavorable phasing and going through the innovation and a high level of promotion and discounts in several markets in face of the low consumption during the holiday season.","As a result of the market promotional activity, the 2% increase in volume was more than offset by a 6% negative price mix. The revenue decline was partially offset by strength in several of our power brands and continued momentum in emerging markets, which grew 6% in the second quarter and 7% in the first half. Our adjusted gross margin for the quarter decreased 50 basis points to 58.7%. We continue to see consistent productivity gain in our supply chain, which resulted in improved efficiencies and cost of goods. In the quarter we also had the benefit of favorable mix towards the higher margin Prestige business. These effects were more than offset by higher discounts and allowances, as well as higher trade marketing expense in support of our brand and by foreign exchange.","Our reported operating income declined to a $143.5 million from $222.3 million in the prior year driven by lower gross profit, higher SG&A and a prior year one-time gain on the sale of assets. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by one-time cost associated with our new subsidiary in South Africa. Reported net income decreased to $82.5 million from a $123.2 million in the prior year as a result of lower operating income partially offset by lower tax expenses.","On an adjusted basis, operating income declined 17% to $183.3 million. As a percentage of net revenues, adjusted operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 13.9% from 16%. This margin decline reflected lower gross margin and increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues, which was primarily driven by increase in emerging market investment following our recent acquisition; and while our overall administrative cost increased outside of our investment in emerging market, our administrative cost in developed markets actually declined.","We continue to increase the support behind our brands and in the second quarter advertising and promotion taken together with marketing trade spend, which is accounted for as a reduction to net revenues increased by 60 basis points reflecting continued investment and commitment to protect our brand in a challenging market environment. Our productivity program is progressing well. We expect to be more than half way through with our savings goal of $45 million by the end of this fiscal year and we are now targeting to exceed this goal by the end of fiscal year \u201916 by approximately $15 million.","Looking at our performance by segment, our skin and body care operating income margin expanded, while our margins in fragrance and color cosmetics contracted. Adjusted operating income for the skin and body care segment returned to positive territory and totaled $6.1 million with the operating margin expanding 150 basis points to 3.1%. This reflected higher gross margin driven by continued efforts to streamline operation, as well as by favorable price mix and Philosophy continues to show good momentum with positive and consistent growth for the third consecutive quarter.","In fragrances, adjusted operating income declined 11% to $143.5 million, while operating margin decreased by 170 basis points to 18.1%. This decline reflected higher gross margin that was more than offset by an increase in MPPU [ph] spending and by higher order SG&A as a percentage of net revenues.","In color cosmetics, operating income declined to $33.7 million, while the operating margin went down 540 basis point to 10.1%. This decline in operating margin was primarily driven by lower gross margin, resulting from revenue decline and the strong promotional pressure in certain markets, as well as higher SG&A as a percentage of net revenues. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 26.8% compared to 32.2% in the prior year. The decrease was a result of higher effective rate in the prior year, incorporating the expected expiration in December of 2012 of certain U.S. tax spreads on foreign sourced income, which were reinstated in January of 2013.","For the full year we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 28% plus or minus 3%. For the first half of fiscal 2014, cash paid in income taxes was 40.8% of adjusted income before income taxes, reflecting the benefits of accumulated NOLs as well as the tax deductibility of goodwill monetization for OPI and Philosophy. For the full year we continue to expect a cash tax rate of 18% plus or minus 3%.","On an adjusted basis, our net income decreased by 12% to $111.3 million, primarily reflecting lower adjusted operating income partially offset by lower income taxes and low interest expense, reflecting consistent strong cash flow generation. This strong cash flow was achieved in spite of the continued pressure we saw in some of our markets and was driven by our continued focus on net working capital.","As we discussed with you before, we have historically been able to achieve improvement in net working capital, first through better management of accounts receivables and more recently by working a partnership with our vendors to improve accounts payables. Going forward we believe we will continue to achieve efficiencies in working capital.","Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $346 million for the quarter and $447 million in the last six months. Investor capital expenditures, our free cash flow was $295 million for the quarter and $331 million in the last six months.","Let me mention that SAP has been one of the contributing factors behind increased efficiencies, not only in cash but also in our ability to better manage cost in our business. As an update I should say that our SAP roll out program is advancing as planned, with successful implementations completed in fiscal year \u201814. Namely we launched SAP in Europe in January and earlier in the fiscal year we enabled our entire third party manufacturing management platform with SAP.","We are on schedule to launch SAP in our largest manufacturing plant in Sanford, North Carolina in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014. By the end of the fiscal, as we continue to roll out the program, SAP coverage will be about 70% both in commercial and manufacturing. As we continue to increase our cash balance and evaluate alternative uses of capital, we have as you recall significantly increased our dividend in fiscal year 2013 and I am pleased that the board of directors have just approved a $200 million share repurchase program as an additional avenue to return capital to our shareholders. The program is open ended and we will monitor market conditions to drive a swift and efficient execution.","Before I open the call for questions I want to take a moment to thank for the opportunity we had to work together and to welcome Patrice in his new role. Thank you.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong, from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First question, just we know you're expecting growth to resume in the second half and that's great, but can you talk about the cadence between Q3 and Q4, given the timing of when innovation hits as well as some of the logistics issues that you've had in the comp period? And do you expect organic growth in both Q3 and Q4? And then secondly, can you talk about the delta between volume and price mix going forward? Do you continue to expect that to be fairly wide in the second half? Thank you.","Michele Scannavini","So in terms of growth, we are not commenting, and we\u2019re not as you know, we\u2019re giving the guidance in our growth by quarter. What I can say is that obviously in Quarter three we expect to see Prestige particularly performing well, also because of all the issues we encountered the last year with Arvoto, while expecting Mass progressively getting better in the last quarter of the year, given that they [ph] will discuss the visibility that we have on improvement on the Mass channel is still very limited and our innovation phasing in our Mass business is more skewed towards quarter four. In terms of volume and price, it's difficult for us to anticipate but clearly as of today we still see in certain markets high proportionality and trade pressure. So it is fair to assume that pressure on price is going to go on for the next few months at least.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just following up on emerging markets, can you tell us specifically what Latin America grew at because it's obviously great that emerging markets grew, but it was a bit of a deceleration from the growth you put up last quarter, and I would have thought that growth would have been accelerated, given the timing of the Brazil start up.","Michele Scannavini","Yes, let me say obviously when you are making those kind of investment, it is very difficult and risky to see growth quarter-by-quarter and we need to focus on what is the growth trend on the longer period of time. What I can tell you is that the growth in the quarter is being particularly driven by our new initiative and Brazil has been one of this one while for instance in the quarter talking of emerging markets we have seen a deceleration of certain area of the Middle East due to an environmental situation that was not favorable to develop business.","So it\u2019s always when you look at the overall emerging market, it's a lot of markets. We have market growing at a certain pace, market growing less, but it was important for us the three areas where we focus our effort Southeast Asia, Brazil and very recently South Africa are growing in line better than our expectation.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Can you talk about some of the market share trends, both in [indiscernible], specifically in the U.S., because I know you said it was pretty promotional, but it looks like some of the market share in both Prestige and Mass for you guys is actually suffering quite a bit, and then I have a follow-up if you don't mind.","Michele Scannavini","So to say it\u2019s a very mixed situation, I should say in all the segment where we compete. So if we take color for instance, as I was discussing before on one side we have brand that is performing extremely well, like Rimmel, gaining market share in Europe and U.S. and particularly in U.S. being over the total calendar year \u201913, even in the last quarter the fastest growing brand, among the top 10.","On the other side we are suffering on Sally Hansen and the reason is due as I was explaining, number one for the sharp decline of these special effects that even though represents around 15% to 20% of the total category but Sally Hansen has more than 50% of the share there. So the decline impact in the overall Sally Hansen share and also because the competition in this has increased significantly over the last period, I was looking with interest to report coming out few days ago from IRI, specifically on the nail category and in two years in the biggest retail Mass customer in the U.S., the number of SKUs in nail color in the store has increased anywhere from 60% to 120%. So this gives a sense of how the competition has increased over the last few years and obviously Sally Hansen having such a dominant share of the market suffered.","When we look at fragrance, also here we have brands that are performing very well. Chloe is clearly an example with market share growing everywhere in the world but also we see solid performance in other brands like Marc Jacobs for instance. On the Mass channel, on the other side we\u2019re suffering a market share particularly for two reason; one for the innovation phasing that was unfavorable to let me say this half of the year for our Mass fragrance brand and also for a decline of some of our celebrity brands. So it\u2019s a mix bag with light and shadows.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","And then just the follow-up question, do you have any sense for -- I think you said that most of the destocking is done, but can you just tell us like in the U.S. and Europe how many weeks of inventory you have and kind of where that was before the destocks, and maybe where you think it needs to go, just so we can get a sense for how much is left in the destocking, especially in Mass? And then along with that, maybe is there going to be any impact from the SAP implementation in June in the numbers; either a pull forward or push forward? And then I'll stop.","Michele Scannavini","So as far as the inventory situation, we are -- obviously it\u2019s very difficult for us to judge; to tell when retailers think that this inventory has hit the right level. So we are obviously -- our way to checking is what is the level versus our position in the year before vis-\u00e0-vis the consumption trend. This brings us to think that today the inventory is in a much better situation compared to a prior year that we have been in the previous quarter.","Again, looking forward because this is so much tied to the trend of consumption, it\u2019s almost impossible to have a clear statement if the inventory is at the right level or not. But what we can say, we see today the inventory level to a much more normalized level, let's call it that and that's why we believe that the big resizing is behind the back and what we can see the future of this more limited adjustment related to fluctuation that we could have in consumption.","As far as the SAP implementation, now we come from several experience of very successful SAP implementation, also very recently as Sergio was saying, we had two successful SAP implementation with no -- in the business and no material change in our shipment flow. So we are organizing our self the same way for the next SAP implementation. So we do not anticipate at this stage anything that is material. So we are not at this stage calling from specifically or significant different flow shipments of as to what should be the normal situation.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan","I wanted to sort of follow-up on the nail category and understand -- I understand the sheer comments that you just made in response to Bill\u2019s question. Is this a category that needs dramatic innovation to grow longer term or is it something where we are just seeing a normalization of the FX trends? And then secondly, like I said, I'll just leave it at that for right now, thinking more in the long-term than really in the short-term in terms of responding to the recent weakness.","Michele Scannavini","Okay. The nail trend, the underlying nail trend on the long run is a growing trend. The category is sensitive to innovation as many other categories. What happened in the last two or three years, there has been a particular boost because of the innovation that\u2019s been brought to the market was particularly disruptive for the -- disruptive in a good sense I mean. So it brought several consumer to change their habits and their use of the nail product have brought consumer to a kind of collection of all of the different special effects, in a sense maxing out a bit the household inventory of product.","So what I believe is that there room and very sharp sense in the category to keep on growing on the long run at least in line with the color cosmetic trend because there is still room to increase penetration, still room to increase distribution, still room also of new markets where this is not yet maybe comparable to mature markets.","So, I believe that is more a resettlement that we are seeing in this moment following the big boom of the latest two years related to this special effect but I have a strong confidence that we will see nail back to a solid growth on the long run going forward, as has been in the past.","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan","Got it. And then looking at the recent rebound in Philosophy -- there is still a lot of skepticism out in the market in terms of sort of your ability to compete effectively in skin care. Can you talk maybe about some of the lessons learned as you dealt with this and gotten it back to growth and does that give you a little bit more confidence about sort of your right to compete in that category?","Michele Scannavini","Okay. As far as, let me say, I will tell you a bit of how we evolved in Philosophy and then I will answer to the more general question on our ability to compete in skin. So as far as Philosophy is concerned I should say that this is happening exactly what we discussed before and what we anticipated. So the brand has the development slower than we were expecting basically for two reasons. One, because the innovation pipeline was not regained the contribution that you should expect from innovation in this category. So we have to work to rebuild the innovation pipeline and as you know this takes anything between 18 to 24 months.","Number two, it took longer than we were expecting to reformulate product, to make it suitable to be registered and sold in the international markets. So as these things are in the process to be fixed we see the business improving and as I was saying before the growth is mostly due to new launches and international expansion but we see also that more traditional franchises existing in advances many years, like Purity or Hope in a Jar, start having positive trends.","So I think the overall activity of reenergizing the brand, bringing more innovation, bringing more advertising, we are in the book, supporting the launch of Hope in a Jar in January, February in the United States in a visible way. We are making important retail activity. So I believe that the combination of these start putting Philosophy on a different track. Philosophy is a big significant brand in United States. It\u2019s not a niche brand.","As far as our ability to compete in Skin, as I said few times, we could have had the same question few years ago about our ability to compete in color. So we if we go back six-seven years ago, more than 70% of our business was in fragrance and that progressively through a string of successful acquisition and progressively building capability in the company we have become progressively a very solid, a strong player in color.","So as far as Skin and Body Care is concerned, we have started a similar journey. We are acquiring brands, we are strengthening our internal capability, we are bringing people that bears a specific expertise in skincare, particularly in R&D and in marketing. We are working on our existing business like Adidas or Lancaster to have organic growth on this business and we keep looking for potential opportunity on the market. So with the talent brand portfolio can we deliver growth? We can. Can we be a top competitor in the skin arena? We cannot yet. So to do this we need more brands and more critical Mass.","Operator","Thank you for your question, your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Guys, I guess coming out of holiday, sort of a bigger picture on Mass Fragrance. I guess it's sort of understandable what's going on in nail, but can you just give an updated view on what you think is causing the trends in Mass Fragrance, whether it's macro, different underlying consumer trends. But I'd appreciate it if you could just kind of give an update on what you think is going on there from a market perspective.","Michele Scannavini","Yes, when you look at the -- there is a difference between the trend that we discussed nail and the trend we discussed in Mass fragrance. While nail was a sudden change of trend and we discuss about this was happening, the trend of consumption decline in Mass fragrances, I should say particularly in U.S. is little bit longer than the trend, and what is happening there I believe that is a combination, of can you say, in overall situation for the Mass channel that also now that category is not heavy in terms of consumption trends and also the fact that, let me say, there is a shift of focus on brands that belong more to the Prestige environment than to the Mass environment. Actually when you see the composition of the business, the vast majority of the business in the U.S. is in Prestige fragrances than in Mass, it is the same things for us. So the big business in fragrance has always been Prestige.","So what we are doing here? We are testing new groups to ensure that we address what can be the need of people that shop into the Mass channel for a fragrance that is substantially good price, good value for money and as we share in the capital of earning call ago, we have just now launched a line in exclusivity with a big retailer in the United States that is called Full of Love, is a fragrance and toiletry line with a very nice appearance and aesthetics, very, very accessible price and this is for us a very interesting test to see if providing the customer with great advantage in terms of value for money in the Mass channel can drive increased consumption.","This is obviously very, very early process because we just started. The initial signs are encouraging but this is something that we need to monitor for the next three to six months at least to see if this is the right route to re-energize the business in the Mass channel.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","And I guess just a follow-up on Fragrance margin. I think you said gross margin was up in Fragrance. I guess the follow-up is why is gross up? How is gross margin doing that well, given the weight of the promotions? Maybe I'm not thinking about where those promotions are accounted for correctly, but if you've spent a lot -- I guess it's more in advertising to support brand than it is discounting, but the pricing wouldn't necessarily justify that. So how are gross margins up? And then SG&A dollars are down in the first half of the year. Can SG&A dollars be down in the back half of '14 as well?","Michele Scannavini","So Chris, in terms of the gross margin, it\u2019s correct. For the previous we saw an increase when we look at the quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the previous year. And this was primarily driven by a positive mix. We just discussed the trend in terms of Mass and in terms of Prestige and there is a difference of speed, and as we said, our business in fragrance in the U.S. is primarily Prestige and therefore we have the positive mix impact.","And in terms of SG&A, you need to consider that there is a component of A&P that is a phase and so when you look at quarter-by-quarter you may have some differences from one quarter to the other. And we also have, as you know throughout the organization and with an impact in all categories including fragrance, the development of the emerging markets which in the second half will be a fully developed in terms of the structure that we build and therefore we should continue to see that contributing to the SG&A.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please proceed.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Just was curious; you guys shared the advertising and promotion number inclusive of the promotion dollars and gross margin. Could you give us how much A&P alone --so the SG&A portion was up in either the quarter or the first half? And then I'm assuming we should be seeing that go up in the second half, given the comments on supporting Sally Hansen, and then particularly the sort of bigger efforts around Philosophy, and I wanted to check if that was correct.","Michele Scannavini","Lauren, when you look at the A&P alone, it\u2019s essentially flat year-over-year. When you include also the trade spend as we mentioned, it is increasing in terms of percentage of net revenue at 60 basis points. It is really the right way to look at it. We talked about what is in the trade spend, which is essentially market disorder that we have had together with the trade. So this is the dynamic, should be more precise. The A&P as percentage of net revenue is also up slightly 10 basis points and together with the trade spend 60 basis points.","Sergio Pedreiro","I want to add, because we said already several times that is important. When we talk of trade spend, it's not discount, it's not pricing, it is trade marketing and just to give you an example; if we launch exclusively with a retailer, all the expenses for the launch, advertising, featuring, windows, activity in store displays goes from an accounting standpoint into trade spend, even though they are clearly expenses that are direct to consumers to increase the sales of a brand. So this is something that we see growing as we grow exclusivity agreement with our retailer, the remaining countries of the world become one important way to way to differentiate your offer. And there is more and more requests and more opportunity there. So this is important to remind. We already discussed these a few times in the past but it is always good to remind everybody.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. Proceed.","Neely Tamminga - Piper Jaffray","I wanted to just ask a little question here about OPI. So we heard a lot about Sally Hansen. Could you get a little bit more color behind OPI? I think we had had a discussion from you guys about you distributing through new doors of distribution here in the United States. Where are you on that process and how did OPI perform obviously relative to Sally Hansen? And just one little clarification point on Philosophy; could you comment on how fragrance within Philosophy performed relative to your rest of portfolio, whether it be Prestige or Mass? That would be helpful.","Michele Scannavini","Okay, so let\u2019s start with OPI. So, first of all you are talking about distribution expansion. You are mentioning specifically U.S. I assume the reference was to our agreement with Sally Beauty. This is off to a very strong start. We are just at the beginning but just to give you a color on this; in the first month we reached 40% sell through on the first orders of Sally Beauty and this is very strong performance. So, we are very happy with the start. I know that they are very happy with the start. So we look to this partnership with a lot of optimism going forward.","On the other side, outside the U.S. starting the beginning of this calendar year, we have started managing directly a solid retailer operation on important countries such as Germany, UK, Italy and Australia and we expect to see a strong acceleration of the retail business.","I remind you that OPI is sold for the vast majority in professional, but we are start expanding in Prestige retail and we see that the result of this, what we did so far are very strong. So we expect to see a material acceleration going forward in the next quarters. Just to give you an example, we started selling OPI in travel retail basically 12 months ago and in one year OPI has already very, very, very strong position, number two nail brand in travel retail worldwide. As far as Philosophy is concerned, the question was can you, the fragrance, sorry the fragrance. So, let\u2019s say that our focus so far on Philosophy has been mostly skin care because this is the core business of Philosophy. This is the most important part of the Philosophy business for us. So the growth as of today is mostly driven by skin care.","Now we are addressing also fragrance. Actually we have very, very recently launched a new fragrance with an initial very interesting result, particularly in some retailers, that are in this moment are supporting Philosophy very strongly such as Ulta for example. And we count on the fragrance contribution to drive growth of Philosophy going forward. But as of today our focus has been on skin care and this is where today we see the growth for the brand.","Operator","Thank you for your question.
