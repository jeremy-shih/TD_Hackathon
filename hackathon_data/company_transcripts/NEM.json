All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open up for questions-and-answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","John Seaberg","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to Newmont's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With us in the room today, are Gary Goldberg, President and CEO, Laurie Brlas, Executive Vice President and CFO, Chris Robison, Executive Vice President, Operations and Projects and other members of our executive team, who will be available at the end of the call for questions.","Turning to our cautionary statement on slide two. We will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","Now I will turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, John, and thanks to our callers for joining us this morning. Newmont turned in very strong third quarter performance across all aspects of the business. This starts with safety and I am pleased to report that our team achieved its lowest total injury rate on record this quarter. Even more important, our performance is steadily improving. Since 2011, we have reduced our total injury rate by 33% and our lost time injury rate by 66%.","We are also delivering some of our best performance at two projects that recently reached commercial production. Akyem in Ghana and Phoenix Copper Leach in Nevada, where we built and commissioned a new solvent extraction\/electrowining plant without a single lost time injury. Our ultimate goal is to eliminate all injuries at Newmont and we will continue to work towards that goal. This commitment to continuous improvement is at the heart of our underlying strategy.","Turning to slide four. The first element of our strategy is to secure the gold franchise. By this, we mean maximizing the value rather than the volume we deliver from our existing assets. Our cost and efficiency improvement programs are aggressive and they are gaining momentum. By the end of the third quarter, we have lowered our consolidated spending by $700 million compared to 2012 and we are just getting started.","The second aspect of our strategy is to strengthen the portfolio. Market conditions are challenging but they also create opportunities. We are working to improve the value, longevity and cost position of our portfolio to prudent investments and acquisitions in both gold and copper.","Finally, we are working to enable our strategy by building on the capabilities that give us a competitive advantage. These range from maintaining a strong talent pipeline and high technical standards to taking a more progressive approach to how we engage with host governments and communities. This gives you a sense of our objectives.","Now, I would like to turn to slide five to look at our progress in meeting them. The numbers speak for themselves. Looking at the third quarter of 2013 versus the prior year's quarter, consolidated spending is down 13% or $700 million. All-in sustaining costs are down 16% at $993 per ounce. Gold costs applicable to sales are down 6%. Attributable gold production is up 4% and we remain on track to meet guidance.","Capital expenditures are down 36%, and as a result, we have lowered our capital expenditure guidance by a total of $400 million since the beginning of the year. Finally, we are creating value by optimizing our portfolio. We sold our interest in Canadian Oil Sands this past quarter and we are currently engaged with interested parties to sell our Midas operation in Nevada.","Let's look at production on Slide 6. Our Australia and New Zealand teams took the lead in improved gold production in the third quarter, mainly through productivity improvements. Nevada operations also had a strong quarter as they continued to make up for challenging first half.","In Africa, production was boosted by higher mill recovery. Copper production was lower than the third quarter of 2012, due mainly to processing lower than expected grade ore at Batu Hijau.","On a positive note, this month, we produced our first copper cathodes at our Verde Bioleach project in Peru and our new Phoenix solvent extraction electrowining plant in Nevada. The opportunity last week to visit in Nevada and see firsthand this facility, and as some of you would have seen, we announced yesterday that Phoenix reached commercial production safely and efficiently.","Summing it up, we remain on track to meet our gold production outlook of between 4.8 million and 5.1 million ounces. For copper, we have revised our production outlook downward to between 135 million and 145 million pounds.","Chris Robison will share more operational and project details in a few minutes, but first I will turn it over to Laurie Brlas, our new Executive Vice President and CFO to look at our financial performance.","Laurie joined us in September and brings a wealth of mining experience to her new role, most recently serving as Executive Vice President and President of Global Operations for Cliffs Natural Resources. She has also served in financial leadership roles for more than 20 years across a wide variety of industries. She is assimilated to Newmont in record time, and it is really great to have her on our team.","Laurie, over to you.","Laurie Brlas","Thanks, Gary, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call this morning. This is my eighth week with Newmont and I am very happy to be here. So far I have had the opportunity to visit our operations in Peru and get to know the team here in Denver. I am excited about the business and our prospects and look forward to working with the team to raise our game.","As you will see from the results we reported last night, our actions to optimize costs are helping to offset the effects of double-digit price decreases. Comparing Q3 2013 with the prior year quarter, we delivered revenue of $2 billion, down 20% due to lower commodity prices.","Net income from continuing operations of $429 million, up approximately 7% due to the gain from the sale of our investment in Canadian Oil Sands and strong cost control offset by the decline in pricing that I mentioned.","Consolidated spending of $1.4 billion was down 20%, primarily through cost and efficiency improvements, and adjusted net income of $227 million or $0.46 per share. This figure is net of non-recurring items, including the $243 million gain on the Canadian Oil Sands sale.","Let's turn to Slide 8 to take a closer look at these savings. Nearly 70% of our $700 million in savings is the result of reducing our sustaining capital expenditures. It's important to note that these are really sustainable improvements, not just deferral.","For instance, in Nevada, Australia, and New Zealand, we have upgraded our asset management and maintenance practices, and this has paid off in the form of significantly extended life and lower spending on process and mining equipment.","Finally, we have reduced our overhead spending by over $230 million, compared to last year's third quarter. This includes advanced projects, explorations, general and administrative costs and other expenses.","I will also point out that we have kept our cost applicable to sales essentially flat at around $3 billion year-to-date, excluding stockpile write-down. These are not one-off events. They are trends we intend to build upon as you will see on slide nine.","As we mentioned, our gold costs applicable to sales are down 6% from the prior year quarter. The primary driver of this is the outstanding result in our region to lower input costs as a result of operating our mines and mills more efficiently. These efficiencies lowered CAS by $65 per ounce. We did experience stockpile and ore on leach pad write-downs of $22 per ounce, primarily at Yanacocha and Boddington, due to lower cost for market-type adjustments.","This trend of continuous improvement also shows up in our all-in sustaining which you will see on slide 10. All-in sustaining cost is a relatively new metric which continues to evolve but we think it reflects the real cash costs required to produce an ounce of gold. The goal in the industry is to enable better understanding and comparability. Detailed information explaining how we calculate this metric can be found in our 10-Q.","Third quarter all-in sustaining costs were $993 per ounce, a reduction of 16%, compared to last year. Major drivers include a 45% reduction in sustaining capital expenditures, which accounts for approximately $119 per ounce, lower costs applicable to sales and reduced spending on advanced projects and exploration. These savings more than offset a slight increase in other expenses, which were mainly associated with adjustments related to our social programs in Peru. This solid performance is fundamental to our ability to preserve financial flexibility across price cycles.","Now turning to slide 11. You can see our debt profile. Maintaining liquidity and an investment grade credit rating is a very big priority for us at Newmont. Most of our debt is long dated with favorable terms and we have about $5 billion in available liquidity. An important metric for us, and one that I know is important to you, is free cash flow which we define as cash from operations minus capital spending.","I am very pleased to report that we generated positive free cash flow of approximately $30 million in the third quarter, and this is the first quarter in two years that we have generated free cash flow. This is something we will continue to focus on and manage our operations too.","Our existing revolver capacity provides downside protection against lower metal prices in the near-term. As metal prices rise, we would look to deploy additional capital to pursue project development, return capital to shareholders, or strengthen the balance sheet by paying down debt.","Wrapping things up, our approach to cost containment is aggressive, but our assumptions for the near-term are conservative which you will see on slide 12. For planning purposes, from 2014 through 2016, we are using a conservative gold price assumption of $1,200 per ounce and a copper price of $3 per pound to reflect current market condition. We believe this is the right backdrop to sharpen our focus on value over volume. We are now escalating our costs annually by about 3% for planning purposes and expect to develop ongoing cost and efficiency improvements so that we are more than offsetting inflation on an annual basis.","Finally we consider a range of macroeconomic scenarios for longer term-planning purposes. These different scenarios have different pricing assumptions which allow us to evaluate projects across a wide variety of outcomes. While we continue to believe that the outlook for gold and copper will improve in the medium term, we think it is critical to evaluate projects and spending in a manner that protects our balance sheet and free cash flow.","And with that, I will turn it over to Chris Robinson to walk you through our operational performance starting on slide 13.","Chris Robinson","Thanks, Laurie and good morning to everyone. Our operations turned in a very solid third quarter. Before I talk about each region, I will give you a few highlights.","As Gary mentioned, we turned in our lowest recordable injury rate on record. We delivered strong gold production in Australia, New Zealand, North America and Africa than the prior quarter and we achieved significant and sustainable cost reductions at all our operations. We also brought two new projects into full operation in October and just as important, we did it safely, on time and on budget.","Transitioning to slide 14, let us look at North America. The headline Nevada is that we are regaining ground on production, primarily through higher leach volume at Carlin and higher grade and throughput at Twin Creeks and the Phoenix mills.","Our cost position also continues to improve. All-in sustaining costs for the region were $772 per ounce for the third quarter or 24% lower than the prior year quarter. This was mainly due to increased gold production, efficiency improvements and lower royalty payments.","Also as Gary mentioned earlier, we reached commercial production at our new copper SX-EW plant at Phoenix and we completed the project on schedule, on budget and with no reportable injuries.","We expect to produce about 20 million pounds of copper a year, treating ore that was previously classified as waste. I was just out into that a last week and I am pleased with the progress the team is making on the Turf Vent Shaft. It is progressing well and is on schedule and on budget.","We continue to progress our studies at Long Canyon, and recently reached a water rig agreement with the local city municipalities. In Mexico, we expect La Herradura operations to end the year at the lower end of production and a higher end of cost guidance as Fresnillo works through some permitting issues there.","Turning to South America on Slide 15. Our South American team is doing a great job containing costs, improving efficiencies and advancing our best options for the future. We were slightly ahead of our internal production targets for the quarter, but as expected, we produced less goal than we did in the third quarter of 2012.","We continue to chip away at out all-in sustaining cost, despite slightly higher cost associated with the start up of production at the Cerro Negro and El Tapado Oeste pits.","Our first copper cathode was produced at the Verde bioleach facility in late September. This is an important milestone in our efforts to develop the extensive sulfide ore deposit that lies beneath the oxide deposit at Yanacocha.","Finally, our overall capital spend in Peru has been reduced. This reflects the very measured approach we are taking to build social acceptance for our Conga project.","Now, moving to Suriname, we continue to work to secure certain government approvals and to finalize our mineral agreement before we reach our next decision point on the Merian project.","Now, let's go out to our Australian and New Zealand operations on Slide 16. We are seeing some great performance down under. Our teams at Tanami and Waihi emerged as our best sites in a recent safety audit and their operational performance has been equally impressive.","Looking at third quarter results for the region, gold production increased 18% over prior year quarter. The biggest contributor is Tanami, where we have improved grades through better dilution control and implemented a range of other productivity improvements.","At Boddington, production increased on the back of higher throughput and recoveries. Copper production at Boddington continues to be affected by lower mill availability in 2013, but we are working to eliminate that bottleneck by next year. Putting it all together, we expect the region to end the year at the higher end of production and the lower end of gold CAS guidance.","Now turning to Slide 17, let's look at Indonesia. Our Phase 6 stripping campaign continues at Batu Hijau, and we anticipate reaching higher grade ore at the end of 2014.","Looking at our third quarter performance, copper and gold production is slightly behind target due to lower than planned grades, but we are seeing improved recoveries with the introduction of fresh ore.","Our all-in sustaining costs were $1,071 per ounce, down 36% over prior year quarter due to lower CAS per ounce. Finally, we are engaging with the Indonesian government to address the proposed export ban.","We remain firm in our belief that our contracted work protects our right to export copper concentrate. We will continue to drive towards a mutually beneficial solution before the July 12, 2014 deadline. But we will also have developed a contingency plan if this is not possible.","We will end our tour with a look at our Africa operations on slide 18. We had a very good quarter in Ghana and I will touch on a few highlights. Gold production at Ahafo increased 10% over the prior year quarter due to higher mill recoveries. Our all-in sustaining costs were $836 per ounce, down 22% over the prior year quarter, due to higher production and lower capital expenditures. We have rescheduled our expansion at Ahafo partly due to permitting delays and partly because we want to take the time to better understand the various options that will improve the project economics.","Finally, we announced commercial production at Akyem this week. Our newest operation was delivered safely, on schedule and about $38 million below budget. We will produce between 350,000 and 450,000 ounces of gold at Akyem annually over the first five years.","With that, I will hand it over to Gary to wrap up.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Chris. Our commitment is to maximize value over the near-term and to position the business to thrive as conditions improve over the medium-term. While we cannot control metal prices, we are managing what we can control.","First is improving our operational cost and efficiencies. We have made a strong start by reducing consolidated spending by 13% year-to-date and all-in sustaining cost by 16% for the quarter and we have solid plans in place to continue this trajectory. We remain focused on raising our technical standards and advancing only our most profitable projects.","We delivered on that commitment by bringing Akyem and Phoenix Copper Leach to commercial production safely and efficiently. Finally, market conditions create opportunities, not just challenges and we will continue to preserve the financial flexibility we need to make the most of them.","Thanks very much for your time. I will ask the operator to open the floor to questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions).","Unidentified Analyst","What does is it to be in Nevada? The cost per ton, just a little quickly?","Gary Goldberg","I am sorry. Who is the caller, please?","John Seaberg","Andrew, is that you?","Operator","Our first question comes from David Haughton with BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning, Gary and team. So two new projects to add to the portfolio. For Akyem, we would be looking for some commercial production this quarter as announced, but what sort of grade have you been seeing there and how does it reconcile compared to what you are expecting?","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, David. Actually, we have gone through and through the whole business and been looking through our whole process on reconciliation. At Akyem, we are seeing grades right around what we expected versus the plan, so that's coming through well. As we built some stockpiles in advance of beginning of processing, we actually have been able to stockpile a little bit higher grade here at the start, so we have a little bit better start here this quarter, but as the number showed, we will be in average grade through the first five years as normal.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, and I see your cost expectation and all-in sustaining costs. What kind of millions of dollars are we looking at for your ongoing CapEx at Akyem?","Gary Goldberg","Well at Akyem, we are coming in just a little bit under budget for constructing the plant, and sustaining capital is going to be fairly low in the beginning years because we\u2019ve spent most of the money really to put in place new equipment. So, I don't know the exact number, but I would guess it's around $50 million a year.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, and then over to Phoenix. You had mentioned in your release yesterday or day before what the incremental production was expected in the order of 2 million pounds, thereabouts. What would you expect as the total contribution coming out of Phoenix for copper including the SX-EW?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, SX-EW will be about 20 million pounds a year, David, and from the rest of the Phoenix operation in concentrate, it's another about 20 million pounds a year.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. So looking around about $40 million all-up from both sources then?","Gary Goldberg","That's correct","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets","That's just going to be expressed as a byproduct credit, we won't see that broken out in future?","Gary Goldberg","Well, at this point that's how we account for it. Correct.","Laurie Brlas","We are still evaluating. As that grows that could change.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets","Then over to another copper production you have got looking at Verde, what sort of expectations do you have for its production going forward? Is it still kind of in a trial mode or would it really be considered into a commercial role?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. David, it's very much a pilot plant operation. We are still testing out. As we said -- Chris said, we produced first copper there just over a month ago, and right now it's good early indications, but if this was to pan out then we have got to go through and workout how we would develop the leach pads and workout a broader program for development of the sulfides at Yanacocha, so it's not anything that has near-term implications or contributions to production that something we see more in the medium-to-long term.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Switching to Australia, Tanami seems to have had a significant turnaround as far as what is coming out of it, mainly driven by grade, but tonnage was up as well. Is that sort of tonnage, and sort of grams sustainable do you think?","Chris Robinson","Yes. From my standpoint, David, where were a year ago, we hadn't had some of the backfill we needed in place. We were working around some of the fringes of the ore body, and I think we have done a good job of getting the mining and the efficiencies back where they need to be, so we would see the grades and the tonnages sustained.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Chidley with HSBC. Your line is open.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Hi, Gary and everybody. Just wanted to ask a question focused on financing and flexibility. You mentioned that you obviously see opportunities out there, and you want to maintain financial flexibility.","It's good to see you cutting costs and hopefully improving the free cash flow scenario as we run into 2014, but would you see the need to issue any more shares, or would you want to issue more debt at this stage given your outlook on the gold price?","Gary Goldberg","I think at this stage Patrick and as we have looked at some preliminary views of our 2014 plan, we see the cost reductions that we have been delivering this year carrying through into 2014, and we see a cash flow profile in 2014 as the plant assumptions that Laurie reviewed here earlier to still look quite robust, so at this stage we don't have any plans to issue any further debt or to issue equity. We do have some debt coming due next year, and it will really depend on how performance is and how we go about addressing that at that time.","Laurie Brlas","Yes. We have a lot of options whether it's drawn in the revolver or refinance that debt, but we will look at that depending on gold prices and our free cash flow to date as we get closer to that.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Great. Thanks for the clarity there. Just one more follow-up question to David's question on Akyem. Could you give us a little bit more accuracy, a little bit more clarity on where Akyem's production will pan out in the initial couple of years of that five-year period?","For example, throughput -- are you going to go through a period of very soft ore choice of surface that might go through the plant quicker and could we see higher amount of production in the early years as a result?","Gary Goldberg","No. I don't think we see that sort of physical characteristic with the ore there, Patrick. We are expecting about 400,000 ounces a year here in the front four to five years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow up on the guidance question. You guys had put forward a target of $1,025 for AISC by 2015. You clearly beat that number in your third quarter results. So, is there any flow through effect to the 2015 goal? Should we think about carrying the sort of difference forward or are you expecting that this is a bit of a dip in costs and we might see a rise in the second half and in to 2014?","Gary Goldberg","So, a good question, Jorge. I think as we haven't come out with guidance yet for 2014, going forward we will do that here within another month or two and can give more clarity on it, but what I can say is the $700 million in cost reductions from last year, we do see and expect to see that carried forward into 2014 going forward, and we will give more clarity around what that looks like for 2014 and 2015 here in another couple of months. But right now, we are pretty confident about how things are carrying through.","Laurie Brlas","Yes, Jorge. As always, you are going to see some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter but this is obviously an outstanding trend.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","And what I am also trying to understand is, from your own internal planning purposes, were you aware that the third quarter was going to beat this much on cost or is this sort of a nice surprise? I am just trying to understand, in terms of the guidance of gold that you gave for 2015, how you can already sort of be at that run rate so soon? And was it partly currency driven, for example in Australia? I get the grade issues as well at Tanami, but I am just trying to understand, is there maybe sort of a one-off currency impact as well happening here?","Gary Goldberg","No, it's not really related to currency, Jorge. The guidance that we gave back with the Investor Day and with the Denver Gold show, when we updated the $500 million to $750 million a year in savings through our full potential and our operating model changes and work we could to drive improved efficiencies and cost reductions. Those were targets we set but we don't stop there. And I think the key is, we are starting to that benefit flow through early which is good and that sets us up well for 2014 and beyond.","Laurie Brlas","And as I said, a lot of this savings in the all-in sustaining cost came from the capital side. And that is something that's going to continue year-in and year-out with the changes that Chris and the team have made.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Well, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. One question on Indonesia. Could you elaborate as to what kind of contingency plans you are looking at there, if export ban indeed kicks in?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, thank you. At this stage, and what we have done is engaged and made sure that the local communities and work force are aware of the situation. We believe, and I would reiterate the point that Chris made, that we believe under our contract to work that we do have the right to produce and export concentrate. That said, I can certainly understand the desire in Indonesia to want to have processing done in-country. And we have been in discussions, actually for quite some time, with both the government and other parties about the potential to build a smelter.","From our standpoint, smelting is not a core competency. It's not something we are going to get involved in building. We would support it if someone came through with that. We are in discussions and we will continue to be in dialog with the government to look for a way to work through that make sense for the government and for the business going forward. And in fact, I will be out in Indonesia here in another week to have those discussions.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Got it, and your contract of work there does not require you to build any refining capacity in the country. Right?","Gary Goldberg","If you read through the details, it doesn't require us to build. It does require us to assess and be supportive, and we have. We do supply about 20% of our concentrate to the Gresik smelter each year and in fact that varies depending on how Freeport has been supplying to the Gresik smelter but that's one area we already have been supplying.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and last question at Merian. Is it possible that we may not see any capital spending on the project next year? Because I see there is no longer any target year for additional production. I think it used to be 2016.","Gary Goldberg","Yes, with regard to Merian, we continue. We are in discussions with the government around reaching agreement on both the mineral agreement and the number of other agreements that tie into that that would allow us to consider moving forward with the project. We continue to assess the project in the current price environment and much like we have done with the rest of the operating business, we are looking at ways to minimize and reduce cost in the operation that we would project going forward. So at this stage, subject to all those things that are still being addressed, we haven't set a date that we would start. So we are going to continue to do work, more or less minimal work, on the ground to continue doing exploration and to continue to progress the things I just discussed.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). One moment please for our next question. We have a question from Brian MacArthur with UBS. Your line is open.","Brian MacArthur - UBS Securities","Good morning, Gary. Can I just follow up on the comment, 20% of your con was to going to Gresik. Is that sort of a five-year average number because obviously your production is very a fair bit over the time and obviously Freeport does too.","Gary Goldberg","That's correct. It varies sometimes when Freeport has been down, we have directed concentrate there. So the number has gone higher, but that is more of an average number, and it's what we expect here within the next year at our lower production rates. As we get to the end of '14, when production goes up, that percentage overall would be a little bit smaller.","Brian MacArthur - UBS Securities","Right. Do you have a right to that or is just a fill-up thing? That's exactly what I am trying to get at, because that obviously as you go way back up and you start producing ore and let's just say they were very difficult. Would you have a right to at least have some of your stuff in Gresik and therefore it wouldn't be subject. It would already be in-country process if you see what I am saying.","Gary Goldberg","Yes. We have a contract with the smelter to provide a certain amount and it's not necessarily a right and there is a variety of things that flex on that in terms of how much would go, but we do have a contract with the smelter to supply concentrate, but not at a fixed percentage or amount.","Brian MacArthur - UBS Securities","Great. Thanks. Just one of the things and I apologize if I didn't hear you correctly. I think you mentioned the a half of the mill expansion you have put that on hold and I thought just the feasibility study was still ongoing. If that's true, can you just maybe remind me what the profile of the grade looks like going forward, say it was delayed out of few years to mill expansion?","Gary Goldberg","The mill expansion, we are still studying it, so let's be clear. That work is ongoing and we are looking at the cost effectiveness of bringing that forward, so that work is going on. I think what we had in our plans originally this year would have seen that coming on sooner and that's been pushed out, because we are continuing the study work.","In terms of grades really the mill expansion is actually allows us to process the lower grade material at the end of the day, but obviously increase our overall production. As we look and provide more information on guidance for '14 beyond, we can give you a little bit more detail on how that looks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Garrett Nelson with BB&T Capital Markets. You may ask your question.","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi. Looking at the 2014, I realize you are in the budgeting process right now, but directionally how should we think about next year's total CapEx relative to 2013?","Gary Goldberg","I think in terms of sustaining capital, you have seen us come off from about the $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion range down to about $1 billion roughly this year and I think that's a good area to think about for 2014 at this stage.","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Then on the growth side, is there anything material there?","Gary Goldberg","The growth, really we have got the Turf Vent Shaft work that's going on. That's really the major project with completion of a team and completion of the Phoenix Copper Leach at this stage. We continue the development capital, but at much slower rate at Conga. As mentioned the half of mill expansion in Merian.","Laurie Brlas","Yes. It will be less than it was this year and we will give that information when we give our full 2014 plan information.","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. That's helpful. Then you mentioned you are in the process of selling the Midas operation in Nevada. Are there any assets you are currently considering divesting? Would you consider other options such as bringing in joint venture partners at some of your operations or possibly entering JVs yourself maybe as a way to increase your copper exposure?","Gary Goldberg","In fact, JVs, we have worked quite successfully with other JV partners at several areas. When you look at Peru, Indonesia and also in Australia, so yes, JV partners would be another way to do it. Potentially, it really depends on what they bring and how that fit works, but at this stage Midas is the one area that we have announced. We continue to review our whole portfolio but as I said before, we are really focused on making sure we control. What we do control, getting the cost of our existing operations down and just assess opportunities as they may come up.","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gary Goldberg","You are welcome.","Operator","We have a question from John Bridges with JPMC. Your line is open.","John Bridges - JPMC","Hi. Good morning, Gary, everybody. Well done on the results. I just wanted to dig a bit deeper into Verde thing. I know you say it is quite a ways out. But I thought that was going to be gold and copper. What is that to likely be? How is the gold going to be coming out?","Gary Goldberg","There is actually a couple of different things, John. And thanks for acknowledging that. There is the copper that you can produce from a solvent extraction leaching process that comes from that type of ore. There is also a copper gold concentrate that you could produce from the sulfides but that would require not just producing a concentrate but then having a different processing. We have looked at autoclave potentially to process that because of the higher arsenic pits in the concentrate. So that would then produce the copper and gold. So that's really the two main parts that would come from that ore body that we are assessing along the way.","John Bridges - JPMC","So at the moment, you are just going after the copper? Or is there some gold there as well?","Gary Goldberg","At the moment, the process with solvent extraction just recovers the copper. There could be ways down the road to look at it different way. Once you leach the copper, you could go back after the gold. But I am not sure whether that's economic. But those are some of the other things the team are looking at.","John Bridges - JPMC","Is this coming from the enhanced copper zone that's underneath one of the pits?","Gary Goldberg","I am not familiar with the term enhanced copper zone. But this is coming from the area right adjacent to the oxide. It's the next layer, I guess, that you call it as you go into the ore body, pass the primary oxide zone.","John Bridges - JPMC","It was enriched down there. That was one of the opportunities at the site. Okay. The exploration development line. You have under spent on your budget on that. Where do you think that's going to be at the end of the year? Because there is a big number in the budget there","Gary Goldberg","Yes. A couple of things. Just to finish that enriched zone, it is much deeper than right near the surface. So that's why, just to finish up on that part, it is in the plans as we assess that. In regards to exploration, we have reduced exploration and that's basically inline with our plans. Some of the numbers that you see also include, because of how we account some of exploration work that's been done at TMAC. So that comes through in to the exploration number that's reported. But we have scaled back from two years ago and Gregory and his team as we go through, we list things by priority and he is working on the key things where we see the best prospectivity.","John Bridges - JPMC","Okay, great. Are you likely to change your guidance then for exploration development?","Laurie Brlas","For 2013, we haven't changed our guidance and we are still on track with that and we will come out with our 2014 number when we give our full guidance for 2014.","John Bridges - JPMC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gary Goldberg","But I think a key point, John. Exploration is still a key part, from my standpoint, is a frontend of the business, and in our business in particular that we need to have a good healthy look at what's done out there but do it in a prudent manner.","John Bridges - JPMC","Yes, obviously. It is a retention between the cutting cost and performing on a quarter-by-quarter basis and having a business in a couple of years time. Right?","Gary Goldberg","Exactly. We are here for the long-term.","John Bridges - JPMC","Sounds good. Thank you.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","Hi, guys. Congratulations on a very strong quarter. Most of my questions have been asked but a couple. At Batu, obviously the high grade is going to kick in at these things. Is that sort of from the start? Or is that a more a mid-year thing?","Gary Goldberg","With regards to Batu Hijau, we are back in to just really the fringes of the ore body now. So we have primary ore going through the mill but it's fairly low grade. We will get back into the higher grade portions of that towards the end of 2014. Then you would see the higher production increases in 2015, 2016 and tailing off in '17 as we then look to develop phase seven and would have phase seven ore coming after that.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","Great, and just one follow up on the CapEx, I know you can probably release it early next year, but Conga, is it going to be less than this year or sort of in line?","Gary Goldberg","I would say it would be less than this year just because we have ramped down. In this year's cost, you have still some of the ramping down of engineering, final purchase of some of the different equipment and you still have some of the construction cost in there of completing Chailhuagon reservoir and the roads in this year. Next year, we look to continue that sort of work, but you won't have all the equipment in those sorts of final engineering costs coming through.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","Great. Last one, just in Nevada. What you are seeing cost per ton basis? What's the trend. Is it flat or you guys are seeing is it coming off sort of labor mining consumables, sort of just total mines, cost per ton?","Gary Goldberg","I think what you have seen and what's reflected in the all-in sustaining crisis reflected in what we see in lower cost per ton. Being out there last week and having a chance to see how the team is doing our Twin Creeks operation for instance terms of tire life, a key consumable cost they are achieving a sustained over 10,000 hour tire life at Twin, and I know it causes a little friendly competition. I know they are dozens over at Phoenix, are seeing numbers that aren't quite up to that and it's helping to drive a little competition, so what's resulting and what you are seeing in their lower all-in sustaining cost is really reflected in lower per unit cost in mining.","Operator","We have a final question from Patrick Chidley, HSBC. You may ask your question","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Hi, again, just a quick follow-up. Just on in terms of looking for opportunities that I tell you I want to pursue. There has been much talk about almost sort of indication that you might want to move into copper.","Have you come across any significant opportunities and what sort of opportunities would you be looking at there? Would it be greenfields, brownfields or existing operations and would you be sort of trying to create more high quality business there in terms of not chasing maybe some larger projects that are maybe not the most profitable?","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Patrick. From our standpoint and as I have been saying, I think it's the Denver Gold Forum and at our Investor Day. We are broadening our horizon to look not just at gold, but also at copper. We have three copper operations as we mentioned and spent quite a bit of time talking about here, the solve extraction and the potential for copper recovery at Yanacocha.","As we look at it though, it's not just to get into more copper or to get into more gold for that matter. We are looking at, does it add value, does it reduce our overall cost, position on the cost curve? Does it add to mine life and does it have both, technical and social political risks that we could manage well, so those are really the factors. It's not the key, and as we have been saying, not about adding volume. It's about making sure it's adding value to the business.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Could it be more of the longer-term sort of slower growth-type of initiative in copper rather than say a big bang?","Gary Goldberg","We are not pressing for a big bang or anything at this point. As market conditions change it changes what might be out there for opportunities, so we are always really looking across the spectrum, but back to those four key points on value, mine life, cost and risk that we could manage.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Right. Okay. thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you. Thanks very much Andrew. Everyone, thanks very much for joining us today. I am very pleased with the business performance trajectory and to see the progress that has been made on improving cost and efficiency across the business, so thanks very much. Enjoy your day and your weekend.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"15606":["Newmont Mining Corp.

All lines will be on listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","And I'd like to turn the call over now to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.","Meredith H. Bandy - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide two, before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here or you can refer to our SEC filings found on our website, newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide three.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Meredith, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter and continued progress on delivering our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business by making our operations safer and more efficient, building a stronger portfolio by self-funding five high margin projects, and announcing the pending sale of Batu Hijau and to create value by generating solid earnings, lowering debt and returning cash to shareholders.","Turning to specifics on slide four, comparing quarter-on-quarter performance, in the last year, we have lowered total injury rates by 6%, reduced all-in sustaining costs by 4% to $876 per ounce and increased gold production by 7% to 1.3 million ounces.","Portfolio improvements for the quarter include: announcing an agreement to sell our stake in PTNNT for total consideration of $1.3 billion; progressing Long Canyon, Merian and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami on time and on budget; and reaching a decision to fund Northwest Exodus, a profitable expansion at Carlin that will begin producing gold later this year.","These performance and portfolio improvements helped us generate exceptional value. Quarter-on-quarter, we increased free cash flow fourfold to $486 million, improved EBITDA by 16% to more than $800 million, lowered net debt by another 13% and maintained our gold price linked dividend. Strong performance starts at our operations.","Turning to slide five, we've lowered our total injury rates by 54% since 2012, and we continue to make progress toward our ultimate goal, which is to send everyone home safely every day. This photo shows the maintenance crew at Phoenix, who recently reached a milestone of three years working without any injuries. I also want to acknowledge our team at Cripple Creek & Victor, who just reached four months working without injuries, our operation's best safety performance to-date.","Safety and efficiency go hand-in-hand. We've been able to lower injury rates from 3.7 to 0.4 injuries per 200,000 hours worked since we acquired CC&V last August. At the same time, we're on track to achieve our targeted savings and to complete the new valley leach facility and recovery plant well ahead of schedule.","Turning to slide six for more on operational performance. We drove all-in sustaining costs down to $852 per ounce in the first half of 2016. These savings were driven by higher volumes, sustainable cost and efficiency improvements, and favorable oil prices and exchange rates. We've reduced costs by 28% since 2012. Nearly two-thirds of these savings are the result of higher production at lower cost operations and improved efficiency across the portfolio. Our costs also benefited from lower capital spending. Sustaining capital is tracking lower partly due to timing, but we're also seeing sustainable savings as the year progresses.","Turning to production on slide seven, second quarter attributable gold production was up 7% from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which helped boost North American volumes by 27%, improved grades and throughput at KCGM and Tanami, and strong performance at Ahafo. These increases more than offset declining production at Yanacocha where we're mining lower grade and transitional ores.","In the second half, we expect to see stronger production at Cripple Creek & Victor and Carlin, along with new production coming on line at Merian. The chart on the right shows the limited impact selling Batu Hijau would have on our full-year 2016 gold guidance giving stronger production from the rest of the portfolio.","I'll take a minute to review the PTNNT sales agreement on slide eight. Last month, we announced an agreement to sell our 48.5% economic stake to Indonesian buyers for total consideration of $1.3 billion. This amount includes gross cash proceeds of $920 million and contingent payments of $403 million tied to metal price upside and development along. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter following regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions precedent.","The sale aligns with our strategy. First, it improves the underlying business by monetizing future production to fuel further balance sheet and portfolio improvements. Second, it strengthens our portfolio by lowering risk. After deal close, about three quarters of our production and reserves will be located in the United States and Australia. Gold will also make up 92% of our reserves. Third, it creates shareholder value. Cash proceeds will be used to repay debt and self-fund our best projects.","Turning to our current projects on slide nine, Merian is now 90% complete. Cash calls are current through the quarter. And we remain $100 million below initial budget estimates. Reduced capital costs support an improved internal rate of return, which is now in the low 20% range.","On the ground, more than 100,000 contained ounces of gold have been stockpiled and commissioning is proceeding on course. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year with first gold poured in the third quarter. We also continue to see strong exploration results, both beneath the current pit and elsewhere in the concession.","Long Canyon is not far behind at 80% complete. This photo shows first ore being placed on the leach pad about two months ahead of schedule. The project remained on budget and on track to reach commercial production in early 2017.","Q2 exploration results are very encouraging and mineralization remains open in all directions. As a reminder, the internal rate of return for this project at $1,200 gold was in the high teens.","Moving from the new mines to expansions, the CC&V expansion includes a new mill and leach facility. The mill is designed to improve recovery of higher grade ore and represents about 20% to 25% of total production. Plan modifications are complete and throughput continues to improve. The valley leach facility began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule. And the recovery plant will be complete by the year-end.","The Tanami expansion involves building a second decline in the underground mine and adding incremental capacity in the plant. We completed the 3,200-meter decline in April, three months ahead of schedule and mill demolition is complete and the expansion remains on track to reach full production next year and to deliver an internal rate of return in the mid 30% range.","Recent exploration results at Tanami confirm the potential to double the current reserve base by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries. These four projects: Merian, Long Canyon and the two expansion projects, will add up to 1 million ounces of annual production at average all-in sustaining costs of around $700 per ounce over the next two years.","With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for financial results.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to report that we delivered a great quarter with some exceptional financial results.","I'd like to start with income turning to slide 12. Newmont reported second quarter GAAP net income of $0.04 per share or $0.09 per share from continuing operations, excluding the $0.05 loss for discontinued operations related to the Holt royalty. We reported second quarter adjusted net income of $0.44 per share, an increase of 69% over the prior-year quarter. The primary adjustment to adjusted net income is a $0.34 per share non-cash tax valuation allowance.","I'd like to spend a minute to explain this a little bit. With the filing of our 2015 tax return, we have the opportunity to carry back losses and receive a refund of the taxes paid in 2013. However, that transaction reduced the likelihood that we will use some of our foreign tax credits in the near term. Those credits are not gone, but we did put a valuation allowance on them due to the reduced likelihood that we would use them soon. The transaction, overall, resulted in an immediate cash inflow of $83 million.","Turning to slide 13 for a look at our second quarter operational performance, strong earnings performance has been underpinned by production growth and continued cost reductions. Gold prices have also continued to rise, averaging $1,260 in the second quarter, up around 7% from the same quarter last year.","Second quarter gold sales increased over 10% compared to last year with, notable increases at Tanami, Ahafo and KCGM. That and the addition of Cripple Creek & Victor resulted in volume increases that more than offset the declining production in Peru.","Gold CAS has improved $5 per ounce from the prior-year quarter, and gold all-in sustaining costs have improved $33 per ounce; both benefiting from the higher volumes and some tailwinds from oil and the Australian dollar.","As Gary mentioned, we expect to see continued production and cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up, and especially Merian coming on line.","Turning to slide 14 now for a summary of the second quarter financials. Increased production along with higher gold price enabled us to significantly improve our revenue, which is up $130 million on the same quarter last year. This and our strong cost performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA improvement of 16% over the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net income increased 76%, reflecting continued excellent performance across the portfolio.","During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $486 million, a fourfold increase over the same period last year, indicating the robust nature of the business and illustrating our ability to benefit from the upside opportunities. Free cash flow did benefit from $111 million in corporate tax refunds, including the $83 million I mentioned already, and an approximate reduction of $100 million in accounts receivable.","We maintained our gold price linked dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year. It's certainly worth noting that if today's gold price is maintained, our gold price linked dividend would double in the third quarter. And as we've mentioned previously, we do plan to reassess the dividend payout later this year as we go through our 2017 business planning process and would expect to be able to adjust it given our strong cash performance.","Now turning to our capital priorities on slide 15; on this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the quarter and how we applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Our operations have generated over $1.3 billion since the start of the year, which we deployed to fund profitable growth. In fact, more than half of our year-to-date capital expenditures of $591 million were development capital for our projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V.","And we've also repaid debt. We've repaid over $640 million of debt during 2016. The vast majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And we've also returned cash to shareholders, maintaining our quarterly dividend. And as I mentioned, our gold price linked dividend policy offers investors additional upside at higher gold prices. We do expect our liquidity to further improve in the second half of the year with the close of our announced sale of our Batu Hijau interest.","Turning to slide 16, we ended the quarter with consolidated cash of $2.9 billion, of which nearly $2.2 billion is attributable to Newmont. Upon the close of the PTNNT transaction, attributable cash will increase by the cash proceeds less the cash held at PTNNT, for an increase in attributable cash of approximately 25%. The transaction is effectively a tax efficient way to bring forward Batu Hijau Phase 6 cash flows, with additional contingency payments of $403 million as compensation for future development optionality. And as you can see, ending up here with adjusted attributable cash of over $2.7 billion. The sale of Batu Hijau also impacts the debt side of the equation.","Turning to slide 17. Strong organic performance, assisted by fair value asset sales, has allowed Newmont to continue to improve the balance sheet. Current net debt to EBITDA of 1-time is expected to rise a little bit following the sale of Batu Hijau before returning to our existing downward trend. This is not far from our long-term target of 1-times net debt to EBITDA at $1,200 gold.","As I mentioned earlier, we've repaid more than $640 million of debt year-to-date and we continue to expect debt repayment of $800 million to $1.3 billion between 2016 and 2018. The sale of Batu Hijau would eliminate the remaining $190 million of PTNNT debt on our balance sheet. We're within our targeted range and now have the financial flexibility to further increase or accelerate debt reduction.","Lastly, I'll talk about our financial performance compared to our competitors. Our three-year cumulative free cash flow leads the industry, allowing us to pay down debt, invest in value accretive projects and pay dividends to our shareholders. Our disciplined capital allocation process has ensured that we invest this cash in our highest return projects resulting in very competitive returns on capital employed.","In conclusion, Newmont's balance sheet remains extremely strong giving us the financial flexibility we need to execute our proven strategy.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Laurie. Turning to slide 20, this slide shows our all-in sustaining costs guidance excluding Batu Hijau.","We reduced our 2016 guidance by $10 per ounce, which reflects improvements in North America, Australia and Africa that will more than offset the sale of Batu Hijau. We also lowered our long-term guidance by $20 per ounce or about 2% through the addition of low-cost production at Northwest Exodus and lower oil price assumptions. Upcoming growth projects, along with full potential savings beyond 2016, could improve costs by another $25 to $75 an ounce in the future.","Turning to production guidance on slide 21, we expect attributable gold production of between 4.7 million ounces and 5 million ounces in 2016, down slightly from prior guidance due to the pending sale of Batu Hijau. Improved grades at Twin Creeks are expected to partly offset that reduction.","In 2017, production is expected to increase to between 4.9 million ounces and 5.4 million ounces as new projects come online. Longer term guidance remains unchanged at 4.5 million to 5 million ounces. It's worth noting that Batu Hijau would not have been a major contributor after 2017, when Phase 6 ore production winds down.","Turning to capital on slide 22, our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. These expenditures are expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities.","Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital of between $700 million and $800 million per year. Development capital guidance covers current approved projects including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at CC&V and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next tranche of profitable projects.","Turning to our pipeline on slide 23, I'll walk through what's changed since the last quarter. As I mentioned, we approved funding for Northwest Exodus last month and the project is under construction. Quecher Main at Yanacocha and Morrison at KCGM advanced to definitive feasibility. We expect development decisions on these two projects in 2017. Estudio Integral is moving to prefeasibility and has been streamlined to focus on sulfide developments within Yanacocha's existing footprint. I'll cover this in more detail shortly. Finally, we added a team underground to the exploration and conceptual phase based on promising drill results.","Turning to more details, Northwest Exodus is a profitable expansion located about 900-feet from the existing underground mine in the Carlin north area, sustaining capital of between $50 million and $75 million will be used to extend the underground mine while leveraging existing infrastructure.","The project adds more than 700,000 ounces of gold production beginning later this year and extends mine life by seven years. Lower cost production will also reduce Carlin's all-in sustaining costs by an average of $25 per ounce during the first five years of production. This project is expected to generate an internal rate of return of more than 30% at a flat $1,200 gold price. Extending the underground mine and infrastructure also creates a platform to support future growth in this highly perspective district.","Turning to Africa on slide 25, the Ahafo Mill Expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs. The expansion is expected to offset lower grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles. Developing the Subika Underground mine would deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo Mill and create a platform to explore the region's promising underground potential. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika Underground mine in the second half of 2016.","Turning to South America on slide 26, we've been assessing options to profitably extend the life of Yanacocha beyond 2019 under the banner of Estudio Integral, which focuses on deposits located within our current operating footprint. As a result of our studies to-date, we're pursuing development of Quecher Main. This incremental oxide deposit would extend the life of the operation to 2024 with average annual gold production of about 200,000 ounces beginning in 2019.","Current capital estimates are between $275 million and $325 million, and we expect to reach a funding decision in the second quarter of 2017. We're also proceeding with prefeasibility studies to explore development of Yanacocha's gold, copper, sulfide deposits. Based on current estimates, these deposits have the potential to further extend profitable production starting in 2022. Prefeasibility studies are expected to take two years, and will coincide with work to improve relations with communities and government leaders whose support will be critical for this investment. Return on investment would need to exceed 15% for us to proceed.","Turning to our market outlook on slide 27. Low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment. Concerns about slower global economic growth and weaker domestic employment have forced the fed to be more cautious about raising interest rates. The markets now anticipate no or at most one rate hike in 2016. Inflation is also trending upward, driven by higher consumer spending and wages. We're seeing more money flowing into gold on the back of these trends.","Turning to slide 28. As I mentioned, depressed interest rates continue to drive global investors towards safe haven products, such as bonds and gold. As a result, longer-dated bond yields in the U.S. have declined significantly and global ETF gold holdings have increased by more than 17 million ounces or nearly 40%. Despite these positive signs, our strategy remains the same.","And I'll end by reiterating our disciplined approach to managing our operations and investments through the cycles, on slide 29. We built a solid foundation over the last three years and we continue to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet through the first half of 2016, but we're not relying on rising gold price or resting on our laurels.","Our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business. And you can count on us to continue delivering safer and more efficient operations, a portfolio of longer life lower cost assets, an exceptional project pipeline and exploration record and a stronger balance sheet.","Thank you for your time. I'd like to now turn it over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And for our first question, it's from Andrew Quail from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Thanks very much for the update. Congratulations again on a very strong quarter. Just a couple of questions. First with the Tanami, obviously, a very good quarter there. Can you give some sort of guidance on the grade going forward there at Tanami?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Give me a second to look that one up. I'm not across the details on that one.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","(25:33)","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If there's another question while I (25:34) look that one up.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. I suppose the other one is, the two projects in Ghana, although it's pretty much at one, the Ahafo Mill Expansion is the big (25:43), you've got the -infrastructure is there. Is there something holding that up, any sort of permits or anything holding that sort of approval up, Gary?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think, we're going through the normal process of community consultation and working with the regulatory authorities there, the EPA, to work through that permit approval process.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And we've continued to optimize that as we signed additional work and that's part of just our normal process of making sure we layer in the cash flows and the work appropriately.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And do you think that will be something we hear about in the second half of 2016?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Absolutely, yes.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Good. Before that Tanami one, you've seen one of your peers actually explore or actually conduct some producer hedging. I'm just wondering if I get your comment on that, Gary. Sorry, Laurie, what that would mean to Newmont, are you guys looking anything like that on the currency side or even on the commodity side?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We've done a bit of currency hedging, but certainly on the commodity side, we feel that our balance sheet is strong enough to manage where we're at and we want to make sure that that upside all accrues to our investors.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And to be clear, the last of that currency hedging we basically unwound and we're letting the rest of that runoff here, which will happen by the end of, well, maybe the next year.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We monitor the market, but haven't added any currency hedges in a couple years.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And back to your Tanami question, really no major change in grade expected here going forward. I think what you've seen in that range is consistent with what we expect going forward.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Okay. So, for our next question is from John Bridges from JPMorgan. Line is open, sir.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, John? Operator, we're not hearing John.","Operator","Just a second please, sir. Your line is open Mr. Bridges.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you hear me now?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Now we've got you, John, thank you.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Wonders of modern technology. Congratulations again on your results and the beat. The project Integral, the Chaquicocha thing is, is that it or are there other things prior to these prefease that you're talking about? Because that's going to leave the project quite light on production. Are there other things that you're looking at in the shorter term?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of what we expect for production, we had initially expected end of production in 2019. What this does is, extends this out at about 200,000 ounce a year rate through 2024. Pending the results of the prefeasibility study on the work on the gold, copper, sulfides, we could see production as early as 2022, but we've got to go through those studies to really confirm it. In terms of other areas of production, I don't see anything that I would introduce at this stage based on what we're looking at.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the African projects, Ahafo Mill and Subika, is it just you getting comfortable with the gold price that supports that and generates a decent return, or are there still a few things that you're looking at before you make a decision?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Really a combination of getting engineering work done, and having that getting the permits to a point where we're comfortable that we can proceed and then bringing it forward for final approval.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. I'll get back in the line. But many, many thanks and congrats.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","And for our next question, it's from Mr. Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. Line is open, sir.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Gary and Laurie, and again congrats to you and your team on strong results. I guess, my question is just a few on the Quecher Main project, how should we think about that in relation to the overall Yanacocha production profile over the next few years? When you say that it's sustaining production at 200,000 ounces, do you mean that's incremental production or that allows you just to sustain the totality of Yanacocha at 200,000 ounces? That's my first question.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The latter is correct. The totality would be at 200,000 ounces from \u2013 on an average, from 2019 going forward through 2024.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you. I probably just invented a word there. The other question I had was on Conga. Anything you can fill us in on the latest kind of political sentiment in Peru toward that, and could you see reigniting Conga any time sort of before 2020?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. We basically have put Conga on the shelf for now, pending, seeing a significant change in the local support for that project. I do think that election changes there are a positive sign in terms of what we've heard the President say about the potential to see development and work more closely with local communities and seeing that development. But for the time being, I don't see us in the current price environment, in the current social climate moving that project forward before 2020.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And if I could just squeeze one last one in, with the sale of Batu, obviously, your complexion and exposure to copper is diminishing. How should we think about your balance sheet now with all of the additional cash? If you were to sort of put your marginal chips down on metals on a go-forward basis, could you see re-upping your copper exposure or are you kind of sending the message now that you're very happy to stay mostly golden? Just trying to understand what your thinking is.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. Good question. I think where we are with our two copper gold producers still in Phoenix and Boddington, so, we still have a place in the copper concentrate market and in producing copper cathodes at Phoenix. When you look at our greenfield exploration, we are really about half of that greenfield exploration is focused on copper gold areas. So, we're not going away or moving away from copper gold, but clearly, our expertise and when you look at our pipeline, I think the next project in there that really is a copper gold project is Estudio Integral, the great copper, gold sulfide resource there that we need to figure out how to be able to bring on in an economic way. So, we're not really moving away from copper, but clearly our production is going to be very gold-centric here going forward.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, it's from Garrett Nelson from BB&T Capital Markets. Line is open.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Thanks. Congrats on another great release. On a sequential basis, it looks like what really drove the strong results on the costs side was CC&V. Your CAS was down. It looks like a little over $90 an ounce and production basically doubled from Q1. In addition to the benefit of first production from the leach pad there in March, can you talk about some of the other things you've done there since acquiring it last summer to drive down the mine's cost and improve operating performance?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It's a good question. And when we acquired CC&V, we indicated that we expected to be able to reduce mining costs by about 10%. And the team there has done a really good job. Things like our contract for tire purchases is an example, as a detail in terms of being able to acquire tires for quite a bit lower than what they were acquiring the tires for before we got involved. I think we continue to look at different ways to improve efficiency. And we've seen that.","You're spot on. We did see the higher production in the second quarter as we got first production out of the new leach facility there. So that helped the divisor and helped the overall costs. I think as we go through our plans and preparations here to look through our 2017 budgets, I'll be looking to see where we can get more than just the 10% in terms of mining cost improvements. I'm looking at our COO next door to me here.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then what's your best guess right now for when you expect Batu Hijau sale to close? Can you get any more specific just for modeling purposes?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think when you look at the different closing \u2013 pre-close requirements, we're still looking at a 60-day to 90-day window at this stage. So, I think the best we can give at this stage. We are progressing, working with the buyer and working with the various government approvals that we need to get and the other stages that are in there. So, it's all moving forward, but we do need, fairly complex transaction and need to work through all the different details.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Great. Thanks very much, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Garrett.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, it's from John Tumazos from John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is open.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you very much for taking my question. Two if I could, Gary. First, could you just review the change in the long-term crude oil price assumption in a little more detail and what the price might be by year.","And second, now that the Indonesian theater is out of the picture, how do you think you and the team will reallocate focus? Will the extra time be spent on Yanacocha oxides or copper sulfides or Conga or Merian or preventing malaria in Ghana? What's the next battle you're going to fight with all that time freed up?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, in regards to helping with malaria in Ghana, I think we actually have made some really good strides on that one already. It's a good thing we've got good folks on the team who know how to help with those things.","First of all, on your oil price question, we've taken our long-term oil price assumption from $65 a barrel to $50 a barrel in those assumptions. So, we'll continue to keep an eye on that, but that's the change you see reflected, in part, along with the Northwest Exodus and the changes to our longer term cost outlook that we provided in guidance.","In terms of focus, clearly, we're focused now on making sure we get a successful transition. As I've said, our Batu Hijau is a great mine with great employees, want to make sure we give a good handover of the operation to the buyers. So, a lot of focus on that here over the next three months. And we've got four, now five, with Northwest Exodus projects that are going through in some cases their final stage; Merian bringing that online successfully is a big focus; Long Canyon, early next year; Tanami getting that through; and the rest at CC&V; and then of course, Northwest Exodus. So, I want to make sure the team's focused on continuing to bring those projects online, on budget or below and on schedule or sooner than schedule.","So, that's really the big focus. I think exploration wise, we continue to see that as a core competency with the team here and our ability to add to existing operations and the work we're doing in the greenfield areas that we've shown on some prior slides in the past in terms of exploration in different areas around the world continues to be a focus for us.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The only thing I'd add to that would be projects in Ghana. Assuming we continue to bring those forward in the back half of the year, that will be quite a few projects that we will have up and running in our process at the same time. So, that'll be a big focus.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you, and congratulations.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, it's from Anita Soni from Credit Suisse. Line is open.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Thanks for the update, and congratulations on the results. My question is just regards to the dividend policy. So, Laurie, you mentioned that it would double if the gold price remains the same. But could you give us some perimeters around what kind of percentage in free cash flow payout ratio that you're looking at? I think you've talked on the call with the divesture of Batu Hijau about revisiting that grid itself because of cost reductions and ability to generate free cash flow.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll start off with that, Anita. I think what we targeted when we put the current gold price linked dividend payout schedule together and that was about a year-and-a-half, almost two years ago now, was based on the way we saw our production and cash flow out over the next several years tied in with our need to continue to pay down debt and invest in projects. And that was based on about a 20% to 25% of our free cash flow paid back out in the dividend.","As we look at the progress we've made on debt reduction over the last couple of years, the progress we've made on projects and the reduction in the cost in some of those and the continued improvement in the cost and efficiency of our operations that gives us the opportunity to look at changing the slope and changing the payout amount. And we're going to look at that. We review our plans for the next five years at the board meeting in October, our 2017 plan as we call it. And as part of that, we'll review whether we want to change that payout percentage, once again looking at what the cash needs will be for debt reduction, for investment in projects and also for returns to shareholders. So that's the process that we'll be going through here in the next three months.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And the only thing I would add is that when we did adjust the dividend the last time we said, we had to make a real priority on debt pay down. And we've made so much progress as Gary said that we feel comfortable that we could probably make less of a priority on that as particular aspect going forward.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. So, you revisited with the board meeting in October and that would be to address 2017 dividends?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. And second question is with regards to CC&V, just on from an operational standpoint, I think you had previously said that it would be back-end weighted to the second half of the year and you posted a very strong second quarter. If that kind of run rate continues for Q3 and Q4, you would probably be pushing the top end of your guidance range even just on throughput, even if the grade dropped again. So, I'm just wondering what the rationale right now is for not guiding upwards on CC&V at this point?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I want to make sure that they get the recovery facility bedded down good and operating well there. Right now, we're taking the carbon over to process over at the original leach facility. That needs to come online. So, just, it's more a matter of being cautious to make sure we get the rest of the project finish before we modify that production guidance.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","All right. Thank you very much. Congrats again.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Anita.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, it's from David Haughton of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Line is open.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Thank you for hosting the call. Gary, you pointed out that in 2017 that the sustaining CapEx is going to take a step up with the number of projects that you've got on the slide deck. Can you give us an idea whereabouts those projects will be, a little bit of an idea as to which mines we should be attributing that higher sustaining CapEx to?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The water treatment you'd see some of that in Ghana, I think a little bit more in Peru quite frankly in terms of where those are, tailings facilities, Ghana as well. And I'm trying \u2013 we'll give obviously more detail on it when we do our guidance here and present that later this year for the future five years.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, it's not universally spread around. It's just a couple of key projects that you've got to undertake in 2017. So, it's not just a widespread lift.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Exactly.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just I think now you were talking about Ghana, I presume that for the go ahead for Ahafo and Subika, are these the kind of projects that you're also looking at higher than 15% IRR at $1,200? Is that the kind of hurdle that you would have in mind to give it a green light?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I definitely see both of those projects standalone being able to achieve that type of a hurdle rate. And then, there's synergy value of doing them both together. So, we'll give more details on that at the time that we would approve the project and announce it to the market.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, oh, we're really waiting on here is just due process of board consideration, allocation of capital. It seems to have ticked a lot of boxes from the permitting and the social license point of view and the IRRs, is just a matter of process now. Is that a reasonable way to assess it?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That would be a good way to look at it.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Northwest Exodus, would you be reporting that separately or would it just sort of be part of the Carlin underground feed that we currently see in your quarterly reporting?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It would be part of the Carlin underground feed that you see. And this year, we had about 5,000 ounces. And just to talk about it, we've got a ventilation raise and then the fans to put in which would occur by the end of the first half of next year and then further development, really it's into 2018 before you see Exodus up to full production. Getting that ventilation raise and also helps gives us air so we can get out further towards the Northwest beyond what you saw in the one slide to the right and access more areas for exploration.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. And for our next question, it's from Andrew Kaip from BMO. Line is open.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning, Gary and Laurie. Congratulations on the quarter. Look, I've got a couple of questions. One, Laurie for you, you've been quite successful at looking at taking loss carries back and benefiting from application. I'm just wondering are we going to see more of that opportunity arise or are the last two quarters something that was just a benefit of that you've been able to realize?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. A lot of times you see that type of thing in the first half of the year as you file your tax return for the previous year. So, the team will continue to focus on that, and I do think our tax team does a great job of focusing on cash. Sometimes you see this volatility in the P&L, but we've got them focused on cash, which I think is most important. You'll probably continue to see the volatility in the P&L, but I don't think you'll see the refunds from a cash standpoint. In fact, we may see some a little bit of working capital flipping in the back half of the year.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Gary, on Merian, you're getting pretty close to commissioning. And I'm just wondering, first of all, what are the main items that your teams are focused on to complete construction? What would you identify as really the critical pass at this point in time? And when should we be thinking that commissioning activities begin?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really have been in the middle of commissioning activities currently. When you look at things like power station, that's been tested and commissioned and handed over to operations. We're now in the process of beginning to test the mill, and doing that with waste to make sure that all of the different elements of that work well.","So, we're kind of working through from there into the rest of the system. I mentioned we've got quite a bit of ore already stockpiled there. So, we're in good shape from the mine standpoint and all set up. So, it's really now just going through the different steps of commissioning and handing over to operations to different facilities. The team's done really a great job in constructing the facility and looking forward to it producing first gold here later this quarter.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Are there any construction activities continuing, or are they really just winding down at this point in time?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Really the major things are all complete. We're now in the wind down. We've been winding down now for several months in terms of the number of contract employees working there to build the operation. So, we're now into that stage of really switching over to commissioning and punch lists.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. All right. And then at Yanacocha, if you're going to contemplate the sulfide development and move it forward, what kind of processing circuit should we be expecting? Is there going to be a component of refractory processing that will be required?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's really a two-step process. It's not so much refractory. I guess, depending on what you call a copper, gold, sulfide concentrate, I'd never called that refectory in my past life. But I guess, where it needs ongoing processing beyond that whether it's a smelter, which you could do in this case or what we have been studying and testing actually here in Denver at some of the labs is using an autoclave to separate the copper and the gold out from that concentrate, and also put the arsenic in a stable form for storage. And that's really the arsenic that's the challenge here in terms \u2013 the technical challenge that we're working through. We believe we have a technical path. We've got to work through the different steps.","The other part of this process would involve a copper leach process. And we've been testing the bioleaching and the FXEW (48:20) process. Actually, it's not only Integral for recovery of copper from the leach pads, but it also would be Integral with the part of the process post processing concentrates through the autoclave to produce the copper. So, it's a little complex. And we're working through the details, but that's at a high level with different components we're going to be using.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Is there a potential to develop or produce a saleable copper concentrate albeit with higher arsenic content?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You could produce it, but there's very few places in the world you can get that processed, and you'd suffer big penalties as part of that by diluting. There is a small part of the ore body that has lower arsenic, so you could segregate and produce some concentrate for sale with a lower arsenic concentrate. That would be part of the detail we'd be going through in the mine planning, but that wouldn't be something that supports a concentrator in its own right.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And then for our next question, it's from Lucas Pipes of FBR & Co. Line is open.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to maybe ask a little bit more broadly on your capital allocation strategy. You have a very strong balance sheet. Your free cash flow generation has been incredibly impressive. When I look at slide 18, your ROCE and free cash flow per share compare very well against your competitors. So, Gary, first, where do you think share buybacks fit into kind of your use of capital considerations? And then secondly, how do you think about M&A in the current gold price environment? Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Lucas. I think in regards to share buybacks, it sits a little further down the list. I think more importantly, we'll look at what changes we'd make to the long-term dividend payout before that would fit into any consideration. And I think the fact that we do have a gold price linked dividend, we do take into account higher cash flows as they come from the higher gold price and look to share that back with shareholders.","In terms of M&A, we were successful last year with our acquisition of CC&V in a lower gold price environment at a time when AngloGold needed the cash. And it was an opportunity that we were able to capitalize on and we see that in the results in terms of how that fits in. Where it makes sense, where it fits and improves the quality of our portfolio is something we'd always consider, but it's got to be done at a value that makes sense to us and to our shareholders.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Got it. And in terms of the kind of geographic footprint, do you like your current exposure? So, should we be thinking about maybe add-ons and the right fits within that context or after the Batu Hijau sale maybe with other emerging countries that could find their way into your portfolio?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the expertise we have in the current operating regions is good, and it's good to leverage that expertise there in the first instance. You look at the projects that we have in line at Ghana that we've talked about for consideration not only later this year, but out into the future with Ahafo North and other potential underground developments, one that I mentioned that we've added to the list at Akyem. Clearly, the regions that we're in we're comfortable with. There's a couple areas exploration-wise I pointed out in the map before that we're looking. Ethiopia would be one area that we're looking at, very early stage development. We're looking in the northeast part of Australia, in Queensland, obviously in a region that we understand well.","So, we'll continue. We always look at all of the operations we have, projects and then external opportunities on the same value versus risk matrix, where we look at value in terms of NPV and return. We look at mine life and the position of the asset on the cost curve. Risk will look at the geopolitical risk and the technical risk of the asset. And if it's something that can improve our portfolio characteristics overall then it'd be something we'd consider.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Lucas.","Operator","And therefore our next question is from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotia. Line is open.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tanya.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Okay. I have two questions, Gary. I can't let you get away without talking about Yanacocha again. So, my first one is on Yanacocha. Can we come back to the sulfides, the Integral, can you remind me exactly how many ounces are we talking about there, gold contained?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to have to take a look. I've got to check that one before I can come back to you.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Yeah. I'm just trying to understand, yeah, just how many ounces is in that deposit and the internal rate of return of that greater than 15%. Is that still in $1,200 gold price?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. That'd be looking at our current longer term assumptions hurdles that we like to see achieved at $1,200 gold and at a $2 copper price.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Okay. I'm just making sure that these sulfides don't require a higher gold price. So, it's not gold price pendant, it's more metallurgical that we're focusing on. And then at the same time, I know we're just focused on this Integral, but when we look at the whole Yanacocha sulfide camp, do we have an idea of how many ounces we're talking about? I've tried to find it. I just can't.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","How many ounces, I don't know the answer to that. We're going to have to get back to you, Tanya, on that.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll have to get back on that one.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Okay. That would be appreciated. And then my next question and moving on to Ghana and back to the Ahafo Mill Expansion, I noticed that you tweaked your production profile for the Ahafo Mill Expansion downward by 25,000 ounces for the first five years. Can you talk a little bit about what's changed there?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's a bit of how you might bucket the capacity between both the mill expansion and I mentioned the synergies with the underground. So, we're continuing to work through in the feasibility study what the final amount is as we go through it, and then provide more detail here as we would announce the project's progression later this year.","Just coming back on your question on Estudio Integral, and I know that using those types of prices we see 5.7 million gold equivalent ounces in that potential development. And that's a mixture, obviously, about what I would say, probably about one-third gold and two-thirds copper at this stage, but that still moves around a little bit.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And I'll wait for the entire camp ounces when you have that number. But just coming back to the Ahafo Mill Expansion, and I understand ultimately you're trying to see what's coming in from the expansion and what's coming in from the underground, but the underground didn't change. So, it's sort of, I've lost this 25,000 ounces. I know it's small on an overall basis. So, I'm just wondering if you just didn't tweak up the Subika Underground or...","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll get more detail as we bring it forward here in October to provide you and the rest of the market. Some of it's just better understanding of grades too because we've been doing lots of drilling and all the different elements or hardness figures into that as well.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Okay. And so, there is maybe something in the greater hardness that has caused this reduction?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We'll run through and provide the detail in terms of how we expect both the plan and the plant to be operating.","Tanya Jakusconek - Tahoe Resources, Inc.","Okay. I guess I'll have to wait for October then. Okay. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tanya.","Operator","Thank you. And that'll be all for the phone-in questions. I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Gary Goldberg.","Gary J.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corporation","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining Newmont's full-year and fourth quarter 2017 conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we continued our steady trajectory of operational and financial improvements in 2017 and laid the groundwork for even longer-term value creation. Before we get into the details, I want to congratulate the Newmont team for executing our strategy by running our operations safely and efficiently and meeting or exceeding all cost, capital, and production commitments, building profitable expansions and advancing exploration prospects on four continents and demonstrating that leading financial, social, and environmental performance do go hand-in-hand.","Turning to an overview of our 2017 performance on slide 4, highlights for the year include delivering superior operational execution which we demonstrated by keeping all-in sustaining costs at $924 per ounce with support from our Full Potential cost and efficiency improvement program, which continues to deliver strong results. Increasing gold production by 8% to 5.3 million ounces as we added a first full year of production from Merian and Long Canyon and taking a measured approach to assessing technology so that we invest where it adds the greatest value.","We also strengthened our global portfolio of long-life assets by delivering the Tanami Expansion safely on-time and on-budget, advancing five projects that will add profitable production, outperforming our exploration targets replacing reserves depletion of 6.4 million ounces and growing our resource base, and securing early-stage exploration options in Canada, French Guiana, and across the Andes.","Finally, we drove toward our goal of leading the gold sector in both profitability and responsibility by improving free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion, improving adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion, increasing our dividend by 87% versus the prior quarter and nearly tripling it versus the fourth quarter of 2016 based on our strong balance sheet and steady production profile, and being recognized as an industry leader for our sustainability performance.","I'll expand on that topic on slide 5. We achieved our second year of working without fatalities in 2017, we also installed fatigue monitors in our fleet of 270 haul trucks, which, along with training, helped keep our drivers and roads safer. To improve consistency, we took a closer look at how we categorize injuries across the portfolio and updated our numbers to reflect the highest industry standards.","As a result, you'll see slightly higher rates for 2017 and the previous five years, but the same overall improvement trend. Going forward, we'll continue to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and to learn from our mistakes as we work to make our operations even safer. It was an honor to be recognized as the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year in 2017 and to be named to The Wall Street Journal's top 250 best managed companies.","Newmont was also ranked as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune Magazine based on the quality of our management team and our strong performance in the areas of social responsibility, long-term investment, people management, and innovation. This recognition speaks to the caliber of our team as well as our success in executing our strategy and living our values. Our teams also differentiated by their project delivery record.","Turning to slide 6. Over the last three years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on-time and 20% below budget. And in 2017, we reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion, a project with an internal rate of return above 35%. We also announced decisions to fund expansion projects in every region.","In North America, we approved the Twin Underground mine and advanced Northwest Exodus in the prolific Carlin district. In South America, we approved Quecher Main to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. In Africa, we approved our Ahafo Mill expansion and Subika Underground mine which will extend profitable production until at least 2029. This investment led to the government extending tax and royalty stability for another five years, which supports Newmont's view of Ghana as a favorable operating jurisdiction. And most recently in Australia, we approved the Tanami Power Project to lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth.","We expect to reach commercial production at Northwest Exodus, Twin Underground, and Subika Underground this year. The six projects shown here will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%, helping to improve our outlook.","Turning to slide 7. Our five year guidance reflects cost and production improvements from our Full Potential work, as well as higher investment in exploration and advanced projects. Covering the highlights, our costs are expected to rise slightly in 2018, reflecting higher stripping at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo, and Twin Creeks, then come back down in 2019 as we bring on new lower cost production at Subika Underground and reach higher grades at key operations.","Our production guidance reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance. And we expect to improve production and operating costs in the outer-years through projects that have not yet been approved. We're also maintaining capital discipline. Sustaining capital is expected to increase slightly in 2018 and 2019 to cover profitable expansions as well as water treatment and tailings facility construction. Development capital covers our existing projects which I just reviewed, and will increase as we approve new projects. For instance, these numbers now include $300 million to fund the Tanami Power Project and our portion of the Turquoise Ridge Mine Optimization Project, which Tom will cover in more detail. This guidance also reflects continued investment in advancing our longer-term growth options.","Turning to slide 8. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin. And we're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon.","In South America, we continued to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru. And positive results from our drilling program at Chaquicocha where we added resources in 2017.","We're also working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritic\u00e1 project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia.","In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing exploration prospects around both KCGM and Tanami. Our investment in long-term value creation also paid off through strong reserve and resource additions.","Turning to slide 9. In 2017, we added 6.4 million ounces of reserves, exceeding our target of 4 million ounces and replacing depletion for the first time since 2012. We achieved this milestone while maintaining the same reserve gold prices the prior year. We also added 7.9 million ounces of resources exceeding our target of 4.6 million ounces, improving grade by 7% and making first additions at Sabajo and underground at Akyem and Apensu North. As you can see on this waterfall chart, 4.4 million ounces of our reserve additions were delivered by the drill bit and 2 million ounces were delivered through revisions and the acquisition of the IFC stake in Yanacocha. Our reserve additions were primarily in North America and Australia, and our resource additions were spread more equally across our four regions.","Positive additions and revisions to our reserve base included 1.8 million ounces at Boddington; 800,000 ounces at Carlin Underground and Cripple Creek & Victor; 700,000 ounces at Turquoise Ridge; 600,000 ounces at our Ahafo surface mines; and 400,000 ounces at Tanami. I want to acknowledge our exploration and operations teams for their collaboration in delivering these exceptional results.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary. I'm pleased to report strong financial results for the quarter and the year and continued momentum in improving our cash flow, dividend, and balance sheet.","Let's start with a look at fourth quarter results on slide 11. Compared to the prior-year quarter, we improved revenue by 8% to $1.9 billion. And this was driven by higher sales at Merian and Long Canyon as well as higher gold prices. We increased adjusted net income by 62% to $216 million or $0.40 per diluted share. We improved adjusted EBITDA by 17% to $736 million and we increased free cash flow by 54% to $445 million.","I'll take a moment to walk you through adjustments for the quarter on slide 12. Starting with earnings per share at the top of the slide, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations this quarter, primarily due to tax and valuation allowance adjustments of $1.30 per share. I'll talk about these adjustments and how changes to the U.S. tax law impact Newmont in just a moment.","Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.11 related to reclamation and remediation losses, $0.02 due to losses on the impairment of long-lived assets and equity affiliates assets, and $0.04 related to a gain from the tax effect of these items. You can see the adjustments related to our fourth quarter EBITDA on the bottom of the slide. We also delivered exceptional results for the full year.","Turning to slide 13. Comparing 2017 results to the prior year, we improved revenues by 9% to $7.3 billion. We increased adjusted net income to $780 million or $1.46 per diluted share and we improved adjusted EBITDA by 12% to $2.7 billion.","Finally, we increased our cash from continuing operations to $2.4 billion and boosted our free cash flow by 88% to $1.5 billion.","Turning to adjustments to full year earnings per share on slide 14, here, too, you see the impact of tax and valuation allowance adjustments on our GAAP net income from continuing operations of a $1.49 per share. Other adjustments for the year included $0.12 related to a loss from reclamation costs at a closed site in Nevada and remediation expenses at former operations; $0.04 due to a gain from the sale of investment; $0.03 related to a loss from restructuring, impairment of long-lived assets and adjustment of equity interests; and $0.03 related to a gain from the tax effects of these items. Once again, you can see the impact to EBITDA at the bottom of the slide. These results help Newmont maintain one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector.","Turning to slide 15. We've worked hard to build a foundation that allows us to continue executing our three capital priorities. One priority is to invest in profitable growth, and we're seeing strong returns on our investment in projects and exploration in the form of improve margins and mine life and a stronger reserve base. Another priority is to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and credit rating. We've done that by lowering our net debt by 83% since 2013, and in the fourth quarter further reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 0.3 times.","Our total liquidity at the end of 2017 was $6.2 billion, and we have no debt maturities due until the fourth quarter of 2019. Our final capital priority is to return cash to shareholders. I'm excited to share how we're doing that by significantly improving our dividend.","Turning to slide 16. In December, we announced plans to de-link our dividend from the gold price and to raise it by at least 50%. Earlier this week we delivered on that commitment, declaring a fourth quarter dividend of $0.14 per share which is 87% higher than the prior quarter and nearly three times higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. $0.14 translates to an industry-leading dividend yield of 1.5% compared to a North American senior gold producer average of approximately a 0.5%. This increase reflects our strong balance sheet and steady long-term production and cash flow profile. It also reflects our confidence in our ability to generate superior returns while continuing to invest in profitable growth.","In addition to approving a dividend increase, our board of directors also authorized a share repurchase program of up to $90 million. The goal of this program is to offset potential dilution from the vesting of our annual equity compensation, and we expect this to occur in the first part of this year.","Before I hand it over to Tom, I'll take a minute to talk about U.S. tax law changes on slide 17. We're still evaluating the complexities of the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but I'll cover four primary aspects here. First, we expect to reduce income tax rate to benefit our North America operations, starting in 2018. Second, the percentage depletion deduction for companies and extractive industries remains unchanged, which is good for Newmont. Third, our total tax rate for 2018 is expected to remain between 28% and 34% based on projected sales and costs. This rate could decrease at higher gold prices. Fourth, the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the monetization of earned AMT credits is also favorable to Newmont.","In short, we expect the new tax legislation to have a positive impact on cash flow going forward. There are, however, two one-time non-cash charges reflected in our year-end financials. Re-measurement of our 2017 deferred tax position resulted in a charge of $346 million. We've also made an election relative to our international tax structure that resulted in a charge of $395 million. This decision to restructure the U.S. holding of our foreign operations allows us to retain optionality as a global taxpayer in the years ahead. We will keep you posted on tax matters as the year progresses.","And now, over to Tom to cover operational highlights starting on slide 18.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Nancy. We delivered solid performance in 2017, while continuing to focus on the things we control. Improving ore-body modeling, mine planning and execution, increasing mill-throughput and recovery, and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This focus helped us to deliver more than $400 million in Full Potential improvements, and offset the things we don't control including lower grades at maturing operations, geotechnical issues and extreme weather events.","Turning to North America on slide 19. The region produced more than 2.2 million ounces of gold in 2017 at all-in sustaining cost below $900 per ounce. At Carlin, we improved ground control and stope design, allowing us to ramp-up production at Leeville and improve development rates by 60%. We're now running a fleet of autonomous loaders at Leeville and Northwest Exodus and you can see our team operating them from the surface in this photo. Work to de-weight Silverstar continues and we'll reach ore that was covered by the slide in the latter half of this year and into 2019.","At Twin Creeks, we mine the first production stope at our new underground mine one month ahead of schedule and remain on track to reach commercial production in mid-2018. We also completed a four-year layback in the Mega Pit, stepping out of the bottom to manage some geotechnical issues. While we originally planned to mine this layback through the first quarter of 2018, we're now reviewing opportunities to offset the impact of exiting a little earlier than planned.","We signed a new seven-year toll milling agreement with our partner to process ore from Turquoise Ridge in Twin Creeks Sage autoclaves, and approve funding from our portion of the Turquoise Ridge Mine Optimization Project. The project centers on sinking a production shaft that will give us access to the richest part of the deposit and improve production rates and unit costs when it comes online in 2022.","At Cripple Creek & Victor, we're loading up the first batch of concentrates for processing in our Nevada mills. And finally at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue on course and we expect to complete the Environmental Impact Statement process over 2018 and 2019.","Turning to South America on slide 20. Our operations turned the corner in the second half of 2017, ending the year with 660,000 ounces of gold production at an all-in sustaining cost of about $960 per ounce.","Merian delivered strong fourth quarter results and the team have launched Full Potential with an initial focus on improving mine productivity and building on already strong mill performance. Construction of our new primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of this year.","At Yanacocha, operations dried out and the team achieved its 2017 targets. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transitional ores and we've also increased our exploration and advanced project spending in the region. Engineering is completed at Quecher Main and we've begun stripping in the mine. And we continue to advance at Yanacocha sulfide studies.","Turning to Africa on slide 21. The region continued to outperform in 2017 on the back of ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements and produced just over 820,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost below $850 per ounce. At Ahafo, we're beginning a layback of our existing Subika surface mine and our growth projects are progressing well. We're completing the primary crusher and grinding mill foundations and have begun to build additional leach tanks for the mill expansion. And we're currently mining our third stope at the Subika Underground mine and still expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. At Akyem, strong performance is helping to offset the impact of harder ore, but unit costs rose as expected in the second half of 2017.","Finally, we continue to advance our regional growth studies which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North.","Turning to Australia on slide 22. In 2017, the region produced more than 1.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of approximately $820 per ounce. We also reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion safely, on budget, and on schedule, overcoming the impacts of record rainfall in the first quarter of 2017. Increased resource confidence at Tanami allowed us to optimize stope design, resulting in high grades and the expanded mill is performing above nameplate capacity.","At KCGM, we continue to remediate a slip in the west wall of a Fimiston Pit from Q1 last year and expect to complete that work this year. We'll reach a decision to proceed with the Morrison layback in the second half of 2019. We delayed approval timing so we can combine two permit applications, but there is no change to the production schedule.","We still expect to begin mining the layback in the fourth quarter of this year, and to deliver first ore in January 2019. At Boddington, the team set and broke records for mill recovery and throughput four times in 2017, helping offset lower grades associated with moving into laybacks in the south pit. Mine plan optimization of Boddington has also delivered significant improvements. As Gary mentioned, we added 1.8 million ounces to reserves in 2017, 1.4 million ounces of which were from positive revisions. We've also approved a new project of Tanami to support continued expansion.","Turning to slide 23. Our Tanami Power Project will lower costs and carbon emissions by 20% and mitigate our reliance on diesel fuel which is trucked to site, by moving to natural gas delivered via pipeline. We have contracted with experts to develop a 450-kilometer pipeline and two onsite power plants. The project will improve supply reliability and scalability as we continue to develop the world-class Tanami deposit. We expect the project to come online in the first half of 2019 with net cash savings at Tanami of approximately $34 an ounce from 2019 to 2023. A capital investment of between $225 million and $275 million covers at least that will be paid over 10-year period and the project is expected to generate an internal rate of return greater than 50%.","Looking to the year ahead on slide 24. The 2018 guidance we presented in December reflects better unit costs and production than our prior outlook and the benefits of ongoing Full Potential improvements. However, as we discussed in December, mine sequencing and plant maintenance shutdowns result in second half weighting with our highest production and lowest cost expected in the fourth quarter. We will advance stripping campaigns in each of our regions during the first half of the year, and execute our annual plant maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter.","We then expect to ramp-up production in the third quarter as we begin to process Silverstar ore and reach high grade ores at Ahafo surface mines. And we look to make a strong finish to the year with Subika Underground coming online and both South American operations reaching higher grades. The photo on this slide shows automated haulage we use to improve safety and efficiency at our new Subika Underground mine.","With that, I'll hand it back to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Turning to slide 26, Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to fund high return projects to sustain future production and improve on our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our new mine growth prospects.","Turning to slide 27. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and the capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada; Morrison and the Tanami Power Project in Australia; the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill expansion in Ghana; and Quecher Main in Peru. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North shown here in green. We expect to reach definitive feasibility at Ahafo North this year and advance the execution in the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady production and improving margins.","Turning to slide 28. Here's a look at our production profile over the next seven years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces per year, and our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our current guidance.","The green layer shows production from our mid-term Ahafo North project which is not included in our current guidance. And the dark blue layer shows the two long-term projects that are in prefeasibility, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside to our current guidance. Summing it up, Newmont's stable asset base and a robust project pipeline represented distinct competitive advantage as does our leading reserve profile.","Turning to slide 29. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid off as we replaced reserve depletion at a constant gold price. At the same time, we also increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per thousand shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years, and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia.","Another distinction is that our mined grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped us achieve and maintain top quartile total shareholder returns since 2014. Putting it all together, we delivered another year of strong results in 2017 and positioned the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon.","Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple, just in terms of slide 27 that you show each quarter. Given a number of the projects are now in the execution phase and if you think about the last couple of years the major acquisition you've done is CC&V. Do you think you have \u2013 are you comfortable with the mix of organic opportunities from here or do you think that you maybe need to look inorganically at other opportunities or JVs at this point given you've obviously progressed a number of the early (30:12) options already?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks for that Chris. I think, as you look, we do have a number that are in execution, so making sure we get those across the line efficiently, safely, and on budget is important. So if you look at the others, the two that I pointed out, Yanacocha Sulfides, Tanami Expansion 2, I'd see progressing this year into the next stage over to the right, likewise with Ahafo North, as we continue development on those projects. And those are some pretty substantial projects when you look at the size and the potential capital of those. So good focus there.","But I think, more importantly, and that's kind of where you're getting to is on the far left, the greenfield side and where we are working with the team at Continental in Colombia to progress that project, and make a decision on whether we want to continue with that investment or not later this year or early next year, our greenfields efforts in French Guiana, efforts in the Yukon and in Australia, so a number of different projects.","And I'll hand over to Tom to see if he's got a couple more to add into that mix.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","I'd also add. Thanks, Gary. If you look at some of the opportunities under conceptual and scoping, there's still some real prospects particularly in around the Ahafo Underground that we need to pursue and the Carlin district and the underground potential around there is still very prospective. So it's really about making sure we continue to do our work to bring those opportunities forward. And as I mentioned in my notes, Long Canyon is we're only in Phase 1, so the opportunity is to continue to progress Long Canyon on the Eastern part of Nevada.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","So, clearly, in summary, Chris, our focus is on the organic pipeline that we have. We've got a very strong organic pipeline. We'll continue to kick the tires, so to speak, on other assets. But as you've seen over the last several years, the only one we did that made sense and added value for our shareholders was CC&V.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Gary, Tom. And in terms of the Yanacocha Sulfides, so can you just step through the main timeline there or what we should be expecting over the next couple of years?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. I'll hand that one over to Tom to cover.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary. So we're \u2013 over the course of this year, we expect \u2013 or at the very end of this year, late this year to commence feasibility studies and we wouldn't be looking to get to a decision to proceed until the latter part of 2019. We really see that that piece of work is the first phase and that first phase is the opportunity to extend Yanacocha's operational life out to 2039 with annual gold equivalent production because there's a lot of copper as well as gold in the sulfide deposit. We're looking at extending that life out to about 2039 of about 350,000 ounces per year and we're still looking at around about the $2 billion mark for that project.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Tom. And the last one for me just in terms of 2018 production, can you just talk through the quarterly progression? I think your productions, Q4 or second half weighted, but maybe you can just talk through some of the operational movements we should be conscious of, I guess, in the first and second half?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks. It's Tom here. I'll take that one again. You're certainly going to see Carlin weighted to the second half in the fourth quarter. Again, as I mentioned in my comments, driven by stripping and the Mill 6 annual plant maintenance that we do in the second quarter. And then, we start to access the Silverstar ore in the third quarter and well into the fourth quarter. So Carlin is a significant contributor to that second half weighting.","You'll certainly see in Merian as we work through our stripping campaign in the first half to three quarters, it reach some high grade ores at Merian. So, we'll see it quite weighted to the second-half.","Others that are weighted to the second half are particularly in Africa, in around Ahafo, as we're in the Subika layback, the open pit at Ahafo, we'll get into some higher grade ores at Subika. And then, we start to \u2013 as we move into commercial production in Subika Underground and bring on the refrigeration plant and get more ventilation into the underground mine, we start to bring on some more ore and higher grades out of Subika Underground. So they are some of the features that have us weighted to the second half and into the fourth quarter.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary and team. Thank you for the update. I got a couple of questions. Just looking at the Tanami Power, you've got a capital outlay here of $250 million give or take $25 million, and that's for a lease payment, is that CapEx outlay for you a lump sum or is it spread throughout the year? How does that work?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, David. I'll be happy to take that one. So we have indicated $225 million to $275 million for that project and that's been accrued as of 2018 as development capital. And then you'll see annual cash lease payments over a 10-year period starting in 2019, and then we will also reflect about $10 million of owner costs and that will be paid in 2018.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","So with that payment, is that going to be a single lump sum or is it spread throughout the year?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","It's spread throughout the year.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, I could just presume it's equal quarter-by-quarter then?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, that's fair enough for modeling purposes.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Question then for CC&V, recovery still very low, I'm just wondering what the outlook there is for the mill component of the ore?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Tom here. I'll take that question, David. We've just moved out of the (36:37) pit and we're moving into two other pits at CC&V. So we're going to see lower grades which is I think going to impact on recoveries through the mill over the next period of time. So if I look at CC&V grade, you're going to see similar grades to what you're seeing going forward, and that's been included in our guidance going forward. So it's a factor of moving out of a pit that had higher grades into two other pits that have some lower grades.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","So should we expect something in that 40% to 45% recovery range then for the mill component?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. In terms of modeling purposes, that's \u2013 I mean, that is something to consider. The other thing is that as I mentioned in my comments we've just taken the first of our concentrates out of that circuit to send to Nevada and put through the mills there, in particular Mill 6, so CC&V will benefit from some higher recoveries as we bring that on. So we've got a rougher con coming through now, we've got some extra flotation sales to put into make it cleaner con to improve the recoveries over the course of this year. So that will also be part of the equation for CC&V and that's included in our guidance.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Over to Merian, some pretty good looking throughputs nearly 15 million tonnes per annum on an annualized basis, that's going through the softer saprolite material you'd be transitioning over the next year or so into harder material. What sort of throughput should we be thinking about once you move into more of the harder material?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, David. Tom again. Yes, we'll start to move through the saprolite this year, we'll see the first of the fresh rock come through that crusher in the second half and the mills' nameplate capacity was down around the 12 million tonnes per annum. So as we start to process the harder ore, it'll come down to those sorts of rates it'll be we've been running up and around 15 tonnes, I think it'll be combination of fresh rock and still some saprolite. So the 12 million to 14 million tonnes per annum is probably something worth modeling.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. And that would be in 2019 and 2020 sort of timeframe?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, I think that would be reasonable, David.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. And just one other thought on the Tanami, with the operating cost savings, were they included in your reserve calculations that were released yesterday as far as thinking about what the implications could be for reserves with the lower cost base?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","We haven't carried that into the reserve calculation yet, David. So that would be an upside as we update into our 2018 \u2013 end of year 2018 reserves.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's it from me. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, gentlemen, Nancy.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I think in Tom's prepared remarks, he talked about the success of $400 million in full development savings. How is that relative to expectations?","And going forward, it's been a great program for extracting value. Does it get harder because it's been so successful or there is enough out there to continue to offset some of the cost creep which I'm sure everybody is worried about in their calculations given the replacement comments?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Michael. Tom again, I'll take that question. I think it was \u2013 as Gary mentioned, I think it was terrific work by all of our teams at Newmont to drive hard on the Full Potential program and the $400 million exceeded quite significantly the targets we set ourselves out. Our starting point for Full Potential is to offset escalation, but we certainly encourage all of our teams to drive to get upside about that, and we certainly achieved that in spades in 2017.","There is still plenty of upside in our Full Potential program. It's moved from a site-by-site focus and it's still very much the accountability of each site team to deliver on their commitments around Full Potential. But we're seeing real potential upside around the opportunities to work together regionally and globally and really leverage our global footprint as an organization. And we still see plenty of upside continuing in milling and mining to improve our cost and productivity. So, we continue to drive that program hard and I think there's still plenty of upside in the years ahead.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you for that, Tom. And for Nancy, the tax implications, can you put a soft target around some of the positive cash flow metrics or any refunds that you might be anticipating over the next couple of years?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think the high level way to think about this is change in rate relative to our North American operations. Again that's all amongst our diversified portfolio of all the regions in the world. And then the other piece is really just positive cash flow associated with that. So the two pieces will be the monetization of the AMT credits, we'll expect a refund on that over the next five years. And then the second piece will be rate reductions for North American ops. So, that's kind of the way to think about it.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's fine. And the final thing is, relative to cap spending, how do you \u2013 Gary, how do you see the lead, the yellow iron (42:20) that you have certainly you've done a great job of keeping it maintained. Is there a new purchase, is it going to be more of buying it given the opportunities you have in your capital program? Is the average age starting to get to a point we need to, to replenish. Just a sense on that and how those prices and budgets may be going into your capital numbers that you put out today?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Thank you. I think as you look at our sustaining capital guidance we gave out for the next five years, that looked at where we're at in terms of improved equipment lives and we've built that into those plans. So there's no big bump in any sort of equipment replacement that's in the next five-year plan. I think the team's done a great job of looking at not just how we get more life out of equipment components and the equipment, but how we utilize that equipment more effectively going forward. So, I \u2013 we also have done, I think, a very good job with our equipment manufacturers, working closely with them on terms that taken longer-term purchase agreements that apply really to all of our operating sites.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And finally, I think, the board should be commended for its confidence in bringing up their dividend policy. Appreciate it. Thanks, Gary, for everything (43:40).","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for any closing remarks.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks. Just a brief set of comments here. Thank you all for joining our call this morning. We're pleased with our performance in 2017. But as always, our commitment is to take it to the next level which we will do by delivering steady gold production at competitive costs, continuing to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders, and technology and staying at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2018 conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team.","Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We turned in strong operational performance despite geotechnical challenges in the second quarter and strengthened our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. This was the result of a steady focus on meeting our commitments, to apply lessons learned and leverage technology to make our operations safer and more efficient, to deliver two projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget, and advance new options to strengthen our portfolio and to maintain our leading dividend, balance sheet and sustainability performance.","Turning to more details on slide 4, the first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,024 per ounce keeping us in line with our full year guidance. We also recorded our lowest total injury rate for the year in June and began to apply lessons learned to raise our safety performance, and we continued to improve costs and efficiency.","I was at our centralized asset health center in Nevada last week where we've expanded our remote monitoring capabilities beyond North America to include Merian suite. The system detected an exhaust temperature anomaly in a truck operating in Suriname. This early alert allowed the team at Merian to investigate and correct a problem that could have caused serious engine damage.","The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long life assets. During the second quarter, our teams completed the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects adding lower cost production in Nevada. We reached agreements to acquire a 50% interest in the world-class Galore Creek asset and to partner with Teck to advance prefeasibility studies. We also formed new partnerships with Sumitomo to advance the Yanacocha Sulfides project in Peru and with Maverix Metals through the sale of our royalty portfolio, and we had about 85 drill rigs operating around the world to advance brownfields and greenfields prospects.","The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the third quarter running and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investor grade credit rating and nearly $6 billion of liquidity.","Finally, we published our annual sustainability report and hosted an investor briefing to highlight our leading environmental, social, and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations.","Turn to slide 5, while our safety performance improved last month, it's not where we want it to be and we've launched two initiatives to turn it around. First, nearly 70% of our injuries year-to-date have involved contractors working at Newmont sites. To reverse that trend, we're leveraging our supplier risk management program to improve transparency, accountability and performance. Through this program, we prequalify contractors based on their safety performance and embed robust controls and plans to make safety an even stronger component on contract delivery.","Second, following the tragic accident at the Ahafo Mill Expansion, we're putting the results of our investigation to work by applying lessons learned across all of our operations. These lessons focus on establishing and enforcing barricades and exclusion zones, designing and verifying more effective temporary structures, and performing comprehensive risk assessments when tasks or conditions change. We're now rolling these lessons out to all Newmont employees and contractors and sharing them across the broader mining community.","Turning to our cost performance on slide 6. Our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement. But as expected, our costs rise temporarily in 2018 as we execute stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Yanacocha. Second quarter costs also reflect planned maintenance shutdowns, lower production and increased investment in advanced projects and exploration. We remain in line with guidance and continue to improve costs and efficiency through our Full Potential Program focusing on enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery, and leveraging technology based on its value and viability.","Turning to production on slide 7. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the second quarter, and we remain on track to meet our full year outlook of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance as well as success in bringing new mines and extensions into production, and 2018 continues to be weighted to the back half of the year when we will reach higher grades in Africa and the Americas.","Turning to our current projects on slide 8, we recently delivered two profitable projects in North America. First, we achieved commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground on the 1st of July which will generate an internal rate of return of about 20%. The project was completed on schedule for $42 million, just below our guidance of between $45 million and $55 million. This extension adds higher grade, lower cost production at Twin Creeks, allows us to process stockpiled ore that had previously been classified as waste and will extend processing life to 2030.","Second, Northwest Exodus was completed ahead of schedule and within budget at $69 million and is expected to generate a rate of return of more than 40%. This extension adds lower cost production at Carlin and serves as an exploration platform to support future growth. Northwest Exodus also features advanced technology to improve safety and efficiency. We're mining the deposit with two autonomous loaders and pilot testing autonomous drills, and we've set up underground Wi-Fi to keep our people, systems and equipment connected.","In Africa, we remain on track to reach commercial production at Subika Underground in the fourth quarter of this year and work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion is ramping up and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019. In South America, we're accelerating stripping at Quecher Main to extend oxide production at Yanacocha. And finally, in Australia, we're laying pipeline at the Tanami Power project which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These six projects will generate an average internal rate of return of above 20% helping to improve our outlook.","Turning to slide 9. Newmont's five-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs with ongoing investment and profitable growth. However, we're beginning to see early signs that input costs including higher oil, cyanide and labor rates could put pressure on our operations and projects. These headwinds are partially offset by a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate and our hedging program through which we've hedged about 10% of our diesel exposure in 2018. We have not changed our global operational guidance, but Tom will cover a few regional and site changes in his remarks.","Turning to our latest investment in the future, on slide 10. This morning, we announced agreements to acquire NovaGold's 50% ownership interest in Galore Creek and to form a partnership with Teck who owns the other half. Galore Creek, located in British Columbia, is one of the largest undeveloped copper gold projects and holds the potential for multiple decades of profitable production. The agreement is for a staged and contingent investment of $275 million with an initial payment of $100 million. The balance of the investment will be made in three stages; on completion of the prefeasibility study, the feasibility study and on reaching a final decision to develop the project.","We believe this acquisition is a good fit with our skills and portfolio and aligns with our strategy to create long-term value for our stakeholders. It also presented an opportunity to partner with Teck, a company noted for its safety, technical and financial strength and its commitment to leading social and environmental performance. Newmont and Teck will define the scope, budget and timeline for prefeasibility studies over the next several months and manage the project through a joint steering committee.","With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy, on slide 11, to discuss our second quarter financial results.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Gary. Turning to slide 12 for the highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.7 billion, a slight decrease from the prior year quarter, driven by lower sales volumes which were partially offset by higher realized gold price; adjusted net income of $144 million or $0.26 per diluted share; and adjusted EBITDA of $545 million compared to $699 million in Q2 of 2017. Cash from continuing operations was $401 million compared to $525 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by lower volumes and higher stockpile inventories and tax payments.","Turning to slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.51 per diluted share. Primary adjustments included an $0.18 adjustment related to the sale of our royalty portfolio and an $0.08 adjustment related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.26 per diluted share.","Turning to capital priorities on slide 14. Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector and we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. In June, S&P Global Ratings highlighted the strength of our financial position and revised its outlook from stable to positive while reaffirming a BBB rating on our senior debt. With liquidity of $6 billion including approximately $3 billion of cash on hand, we remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities including investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders.","Earlier this week, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of 87% over the prior year quarter. Based on an annualized quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and the share buyback program, we are on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders in 2018.","And now I'll hand it over to Tom for a discussion of our operations, starting on slide 15.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Nancy. Turning to North America on slide 16. As expected, Carlin's production was lower as we safely completed our annual planned maintenance at Mill 6 on time and under budget, and we continue to monitor and manage geotechnical risks as we work to de-weight the slip in the Silverstar pit from 2016 in order to access the ore.","At CC&V, production was impacted by lower leach recoveries and continued stockpiling of concentrates for shipment to Nevada. This quarter, Carlin began processing CC&V concentrates, which will improve recoveries at both sites over time. Through June, we shipped 17,000 ounces to Nevada and stockpiled 29,000 ounces at CC&V. Shipments are expected to increase over the coming months.","In addition, improvements to the CC&V mill are now complete. These will allow for the production of a cleaner concentrate to be shipped starting in the second half of 2018.","Twin Creeks continues to manage through lower grades as stripping begins in the next layback of the mega pit. And as Gary mentioned, we completed both the Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus projects adding lower cost production in Nevada. I'd like to thank the teams at Carlin and Twin Creeks for continuing to deliver on our strategy and extend the profitable production in North America.","And finally, studies into the next phase for Long Canyon are continuing on course.","Turning to South America on slide 17. At Merian, we generated solid performance during the second quarter with continued mill productivity improvements. Just last week, I was able to see the new primary crusher operating. It is on track to be commissioned in the third quarter and will help sustain mill throughput when we reach fresh rock early next year.","Four additional trucks arrived at site on schedule and will increase hauling capacity going forward, and our Full Potential Program is underway at Merian and we are starting to deliver further improvements.","At Yanacocha, an optimized ore blending strategy has helped offset slower leach recoveries, and we expect cost to improve as the change in our mill feed strategy has prioritized lower cost oxides over deep transitional ore.","We are accelerating stripping at Quecher Main and expect to start placing ore on an existing leach pad by the end of the year. The drilling program at Chaquicocha Oxides is ongoing and we continue to advance studies for Yanacocha Sulfides to reach definitive feasibility late this year.","Turning to Australia on slide 18. KCGM experienced rock falls on the eastern wall of Fimiston Pit in mid-May. The mine detection systems identified movement prior to the event and no one was injured. Mining continues in the southern end of the pit. However, an exclusion zone has been put in place at the bottom of the eastern wall as an additional safety precaution. As a consequence, mining rights have been reduced and we now expect our share of 2018 production to be between 290,000 ounces and 330,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce. We do have insurance coverage for these type of pit wall events and are engaged with the affected underwriters.","The Mt. Charlotte underground mine and the KCGM processing plants are operating normally and the site is able to process stockpiled ore. The KCGM team continues to assess longer term impacts including mine plan reevaluations. We have received the API permit for the Morrison layback and subject to the mine plan reviews still anticipate some form of this project to proceed later this year.","At Boddington, we delivered a strong quarter with high production as maintenance originally scheduled for Q2 was pulled forward to Q1. This timing shift was part of the site's Full Potential Program to optimize the mill maintenance strategy and improve performance. Looking forward, Boddington is ramping up their planned stripping campaign in the second half of 2018 and it will continue through 2019.","At Tanami, strong mill performance and improved mine productivity offset lower grades in the second quarter. The Tanami Power project has been fully permitted and the pipeline construction teams have been mobilized. Civil work for the power stations is well underway and the project is expected to come online in the first half of 2019. Finally, we are advancing Tanami Expansion 2 studies and drilling a pilot hole for a shaft to further inform our approach.","Turning to Africa on slide 19. In the first half of 2018, we delivered steady results at both Ahafo and Akyem, as strong mill performance continues to offset harder ores and lower grades. However, at Ahafo, unit costs increased due to high inventory cost driven by lower mine grades and higher surface mining costs. As a result, we now expect Africa's 2018 all-in sustaining costs to be between $890 and $940 per ounce with no change to our production guidance.","Looking ahead, we continue to work with the Minerals Commission and are in the process of slightly restarting construction activities at Ahafo's 2 Expansion projects. The delay in the Ahafo mill expansion schedule will shift first gold into the second half of 2019, but we still anticipate reaching commercial production during the same period with no change to the title capital estimate.","Subika Underground continues to ramp up, and despite minor delays in constructing surface infrastructure, the project is still expected to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year. We continue to advance studies for Ahafo North and Ahafo Underground, and we progress the Akyem Underground project to prefeasibility. This mixed stage of study will focus on permitting and increasing resource confidence.","Turning to the rest of the year on slide 20. We continue to be back-half weighted in 2018. Third quarter production is expected to improve as we increase processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada and continue mining at Subika Underground. However, costs are expected to increase at KCGM and at Long Canyon and Boddington with higher stripping. We plan to finish the year strongly with grades improving at Carlin, Yanacocha and Ahafo, delivering a highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. In summary, a global cost production and capital outlook is unchanged, and we remain on track to meet our commitments in 2018.","Now, I hand it back to Gary on slide 21.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Turning to slide 22, we continue to focus on operating and growing our business in four regions where we have the stability, resources and relationships that underpin our ongoing success. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. And we continue to invest in projects and prospects that will improve our margins, reserves, and resources. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline.","Turning to slide 23, Newmont's team has proven its ability to optimize projects, deliver them on time and budget, and generate a solid rate of return. This gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, and Quecher Main in Peru. Twin Underground and Northwest Exodus are also included in our outlook, but we remove from the pipeline at completion. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North shown here in green. We continue to invest in progressing our longer term projects shown here in dark blue.","This quarter, we advance Akyem Underground from scoping to prefeasibility and expect to start delivering the decline in 2020 \u2013 developing, rather, the decline in 2020 with ore process through the existing mill. Finally, we added Galore Creek to our pipeline as a prefeasibility stage project. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.","Turning to slide 24, this is our expected production profile for the next seven years. Gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over the same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance. The green layer shows production from our mid-term Ahafo North project which is not included in our guidance and the dark blue layer shows two longer term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and the Yanacocha Sulfides, representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage and we will maintain that advantage over the longer term by investing in exploration.","Turning to slide 25, in North America, we continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin and progress the prefeasibility study for Long Canyon Phase 2. Our Plateau exploration program is underway in the Canadian Yukon and we plan to test eight different drill targets this year. Finally, we will begin scoping prefeasibility studies at Galore Creek in the coming months. We expect these studies to be completed over three to four years with an annual budget of between $10 million and $15 million for our 50% stake.","In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru, and we're working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high grade Buritic\u00e1 project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. We're also establishing a new country office in Medell\u00edn and have appointed a fit-for-purpose team to establish our presence and relationships in the country.","In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and Akyem, and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia.","Finally in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects across the continent. Newmont has laid a strong foundation for these efforts by establishing fair land agreements with traditional owners and a reputation for respectful engagement.","Putting it all together, on slide 26, we delivered solid second quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We will continue to execute our long-term strategy which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a long-time horizon; invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business; and lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold.","Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning all. Can you hear me, Gary?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. So the gestation period for Galore continues. Do you want to share a little more on your thought process here, is it the (25:29) market, pricing, timing, the opportunities in jurisdiction. What were some of the real major thrusts to bring this all together and has this been on the plate for a while or did it happen recently, just a little more color towards the thought process here with Galore?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure thing. I think as we assess all things, we look for longer term value opportunities and I've been very clear we're looking for gold or copper gold potential. This is actually I think in the history of Newmont, probably the third time around that we've taken a look and this is an opportunity we think at fair value we've been able to acquire and we really like working with Teck. We worked and talked with them in the past. I think our value set and approach to operations and sustainability really come together quite well and just see this as a good opportunity.","Clearly, we've got work to do. We've got a prefeasibility study that's going to take the next three to four years to work through with Teck and figure out what is the right way to develop this deposit and how to bring it forward and when to bring it forward. So there's more work to do, but we're excited about the potential both at the resource and working with our new partner, Teck.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Gary, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, I think you said 83 rigs around the world that you're working on. As we look towards your reserve profile next year, where are some of the opportunities you're seeing some better results and more exciting results to help us achieve those goals?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I mean, I think we mentioned, including in the call here, we're seeing some good results at Yanacocha as we continue to look at both the sulfides and the oxide deposits. Tanami would be another area that looks exciting. I see some interesting results coming out of the Carlin area in terms of work we're doing there. Long Canyon, we continue to bring forward and the Ahafo Underground and, as I mentioned, the Akyem Underground's moved forward. We're seeing some good things there. So still we won't declare reserves changes till the end of the year, but we see ourselves on track towards that 4 million ounce reserve addition, at least that amount here this year.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And finally, Gary, as you assess cost pressures as you highlighted, have they accelerated from first quarter or from what you had anticipated a year ago, are they abating and where are maybe one or two areas that are really \u2013 I'm sure it's more regional than not, but that is more difficult to offset from Full Potential?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think clearly oil costs have affected the whole business, so that one I think everyone's got good transparency and we give some information on. Offsetting that, the Aussie dollar has dropped back down kind of in line with as gold price has come down. So it's down in the $0.74 to $0.75 range. We have seen some cyanide cost increases, and that's really input costs that go into the cyanide product that have been coming through. That's a little bit outside of what we would have had built into our plans. A little bit of labor. Really kind of keeping an eye on, as I said before, we watch where turnover is starting to pick up and we've seen a little bit in North America and in Australia, the labor markets heating up a bit, so we're keeping an eye on that. Nothing outside of what we at this stage had planned for, but it's one that I want to flag for the market as we go forward that we're keeping an eye on.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Excellent, Gary. Thank you for your thoughts.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Gary, everybody. Thanks for a drama-free set of results. Just following on from Mike's question on Galore, it had a pretty long development plan in some of the earlier feasibility studies with this long tunnel and whatever. I know it's early stage, but would you be sort of likely to be dribbling capital into that to shorten the development program and make it easier to make a decision when the copper price and the markets are receptive?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think \u2013 thanks for the question, John, and thanks for the comment on the lack of dramas. I think we wouldn't be trying to time a market. I don't think anyone's that good at this stage. What we would be doing is to really step back, take a good look at the work that's been done, a lot of good work has been done already, but then bring our heads together with the technical and social folks with Teck and work together with our team to come up with the best development plan. There's different options in terms of how to access and develop the resource, the several pits or potential pits that are there and we want to work through. So I don't want to preclude anything at this stage. I think we want to take a look with an open mind at all the options.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just perhaps as a follow-up, you mentioned the underground opportunities within Carlin. What's your vision for that large land package you got there, because if you simply look at the reserve base in Carlin, then it's one of the shorter life assets on a sort of production versus reserve basis. But then, given the underground opportunities you found already and the ones that you have a sense that could be there, then you could be mining there for a long time.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think and as you've seen, Carlin has been in operation for over 50 years, we have a pretty good resource and mineral inventory base that we're pretty confident, as we continue to better understand some of the geology and structure around there, that we could add primarily from an underground standpoint, as I see it, but I spent time \u2013 I was out there last week really at all the operations and feel comfortable in terms of extensions around Carlin. Long Canyon, we continue the development of Phase 2. Some interesting things around Emigrant that we're taking a look at. So as we use both current technology and continue to extend the use of our deep sensing geochemistry to better understand things that may be covered at depths that we haven't actually looked at, most of what's been discovered today has had some sort of a surface exposure or been accidentally found by a water well or something. So I think using this technology to try to discover as yet unfound deposits, I think, has good potential in Nevada.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Good luck and thanks again for the results.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary, Nancy and Tom. I was actually admiring the core that you've got on page 26 from Tanami. Very impressive bit of VG (32:42) there. Just going over to Ahafo, so you're now pushing the commercial startup, it looks like it would be delayed by as much as a quarter given unfortunately the circumstances early this year. But the CapEx is maintained for 2018. Can you see some sliding of the CapEx from 2018 into 2019?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I have Tom address that.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary. Thanks, David. What we're able to do following the shutdown at the construction work on site, David, as we worked through that incident and the appropriate recovery from that, is still quite a bit of offsite work going on, so lot of fabrication and procurement works too going on and that was able to help us minimize the impact of schedule. So we're still seeing a similar spend profile in this year as a consequence of that. So there will be a little bit of flow of our capital into next year as a result of the cessation of construction activity on site, but as I say, a lot of offsite work was able to continue through that time period.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","And you're thinking we should be looking at commercial production more in Q4 of next year than in Q3 or Q2?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","At this stage, I just keep it to the second half and we were very much in the process of remobilizing now. So as we get back into construction activities proper, then we'll be out to reassess the various work fronts and then understand and refine that schedule. So I'd keep it a second half at this stage.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","All right. To Kalgoorlie, so guidance this year down 70,000 ounces impact into next year as a consequence of that east wall slip. Can you just walk us through what the implications are for the mining with, I presume, a restricted footprint of access and remedial work, and what it means for the layback of Morrison and the timing of that?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, David. I'll keep going with the answer to that question. So with the slip on the east wall that took out the ramp on the east wall of that pit. So, that was the ramp we're planning to use for the Morrison layback that we were bringing forward. So as we work through the reassessment of Morrison, it will be how we can mine a smaller Morrison and not rely upon that ramp on the east wall.","Now, as we work through our longer term plans looking at our \u2013 lot of the work today was about safely understanding the impact of that slip and understanding the impact for this year, so work's still underway in terms of the longer term impact and the various scenarios around that. A lot of that is associated with the type of remediation that we'll do on that better east wall and how we might lay back that slip area and the various geotechnical work and the drilling work we'll need to do to better inform that approach. So, that's going to take a little bit of time for us to work through and then understand the longer term impacts beyond 2018 and then how we access the greater Morrison resource, but we'll continue to be mining from the southern end of the pit and there's some material on the western wall as well that we'll be de-stacking that's been sitting underneath the west wall slip and we'll continue to process stockpiled ore through the mill. So the processing plants, the two \u2013 well, the three processing plants at KCGM are still running at full rates and in fact they're running at rates that we haven't seen since 2005. So we're maximizing the processing through the plant to minimize the impact from this slip.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","The strip CapEx there was going to be about $125 million spread over a number of years, 2018 through to 2025 basically and getting production access to Morrison in 2019. Should we be pushing that out by a year or two do you think?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","We'll have a \u2013 I'm anticipating having a smaller Morrison this year. How big that is and what the spend will be, we're still working through. So we need some more time to work through that process. So we'll need to come back to you at a future date with some more information there, David.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","All right. I'll leave it there for now. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks. Thanks, David. And reminder, you get an opportunity to see first-hand that core from Tanami if you visit in November that we've got planned with investors.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Very nice.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And just a follow-up on David's question if I might, maybe is it reasonable to look at KCGM as for the next couple of years, anyway is maintaining sort of your share of production at the 280,000 to 300,000 ounce a year range that is looking at the stockpiles, lower grades and the other sources of work to basically sustain that at these levels. Is that a safe assumption when we look at our model for KCGM?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, I think at this stage, Stephen, as we continue as Tom described the planning work that's going on, I think that's a good starting point and we'll give further update most likely when we give our full year guidance for 2019 at the end of this year.","Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And then just a separate question on CC&V. Tom, you made the reference to that you shipped about 17,000 tonnes (sic) [ounces] of con to the Carlin plant. I guess the question is on a quarterly run rate basis, what should we assume and is that concentrating \u2013 is that concentrate displacing roaster ore as it is a lower grade roaster ore and should we see an improvement in what comes out of the roasters in Carlin as you ship more material from CC&V?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Stephen. I just might clarify that was 17,000 ounces of gold that we shipped in a 30,000 sitting stockpiled. You will certainly see \u2013 there's two things. That stockpiled ore will start to \u2013 stockpiled concentrate will start to move through the third and fourth quarter. We'll stockpile them because we had to do some improvements to a county road that are now complete, so we're ramping up shipments as we speak and we are now commissioning the cleaner concentrate circuit that will produce a higher grade particularly in sulfur coming out of the CC&V plant, so that gold and sulfur will go into Mill 6, so it provides a heat source that allows us to put higher grade Carlin ore through Mill 6, so we will see some benefit at Carlin as a result of that fuel source that comes from that concentrate. We are still very much on target to hit our guidance for CC&V, so if you just look at first half and extrapolate to where we're predicting guidance to be for the year, you can get a measure of the impact of shipping that concentrate to Nevada is going to have on CC&V gold production for the full year and in particular the second half.","Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Perfect. And then presumably extend that into 2019, 2020 as well?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's right. That process of sending concentrate to Nevada will continue in the future years.","Stephen David Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you very much for that, Tom. That's all my questions.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. Good morning, everybody. I guess David asked my questions on the Morrison layback, and just to make sure I understood, so by year-end, we will have some sort of an idea when you put out your guidance, I guess, in December. What the sort of smaller Morrison layback looks like just with the \u2013 getting back to the ramp access that you right now don't have, is that a clear \u2013 am I understanding it correctly?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. That's correct, Tanya.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. So I'll leave that one. And maybe I can come back to two other things. One is just back on Galore Creek. Just wanted to understand, Gary, you said this is the third time you've looked at this. Coming back to it a third time, was it \u2013 there is a willing seller right now, was it just a willing seller? And how did you come up with the valuation on the purchase price, was it based on dollar per ounce in the ground, was it based on a discounted cash flow? I'm just trying to understand how you put value on this.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Well, little bit of all of the above. And it was about a year ago that we began dialog with the group and have worked through our view on what the value of the deposit is at this stage and then went through the normal sort of commercial negotiation that you go through to reach commercial terms and we staged it. So as we move forward and get better confidence in it, it's tied back into us gaining greater confidence in the future and how it would be developed. So, that didn't come all at once. We worked through that as we worked through the prefeas and then feasibility studies.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. So is it safe to say that it's been a year that you've been working on this and you've looked at all of the studies out there and somewhere between looking at the studies and valuation on per ounce in the ground is how you came up with your purchase price for unstaged (43:01) payments?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes, that's correct.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just coming back to Akyem, I noticed that you put a press release on your website with regards to some contention with farmers around the area and some compensation. Can you just give us an update of what's exactly happening there?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. I'm going to hand over to Tom to cover that.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary. And thanks, Tanya, for the question. We're working through a process where some local residents raised some concerns over payment of ground and crop compensation that dates back to before the mine started and then having some issues around mine-related impact. So everything we're doing is consistent with what we're required to do and in terms of the agreements we've had in place. But we've been involved in good faith dialog with community leaders, with the people who are raising these concerns and working through a mediation process to reach a form of resolution there with them. And that process has been progressing over a period of time.","What you saw in more recent times is the group which we're quite comfortable with stage a demonstration to further support their claim. So, that took place, a peaceful demonstration over a few hours a couple of days ago. So the activity was related to that. But we continue to engage in good faith dialog to reach a resolution with those people who are raising those concerns.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","And when is the mediation? Do you have a timeline for the mediation process?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","It's been ongoing and we will continue to work through that process until we can reach a resolution. There isn't any fixed deadline, but we remain ready, willing and able to sit down and discuss these issues with them.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","So besides the peaceful demonstration that you had the other day, is that really the only sort of demonstration you've had on this site with respect to these farmers and their crops?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. Going back in terms of my memory and it's \u2013 yes, that would be the case.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. And we've seen nothing like this at Ahafo in that area?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","We haven't seen demonstrations on these particular issues at Ahafo, but we do see from time to time demonstrations over different issues that we need to work through with the community and the community leaders to manage and understand those issues. So it's not unusual in Ghana to see the community demonstrate as part of a process of talking through their issues.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Okay. We'll continue to monitor it. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tanya.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Jalonen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Jalonen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Gary. Maybe a question for yourself; and Randy, just coming back to Galore again, I know there's been a few questions, but I still haven't quite heard from you because here's a project that Teck basically mothballed many years ago, never heard much about it and then now it's come back to life again. Just wondering where Teck \u2013 or sorry, Newmont, I guess Teck also, see the opportunity to improve the economics of the project that could lead to a positive feasibility studies or attractive returns, I guess, that's what I was wondering.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think as you look in Teck's published information, they've got it out there as a longer term opportunity. We see it in a similar manner and one that we'll work together to see if we can improve on the valuation. I'm going to see if Randy wants to add anything to that.","Randall E. Engel - Newmont Mining Corp.","Mike, I think there's \u2013 this project, there is opportunities to look at the things like the tunnel, the access opportunities, I think phased mine planning, plant design optimization, all of those opportunities with taking two quality partners like Teck and Newmont working together, it really could create some substantial value above and beyond what's been looked at so far. I think there is good opportunity to define the upside further on the ore body and the resource.","Michael Jalonen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Does this kind of signifies Newmont's acquisition strategy, focusing on more longer term development projects rather than assets in production?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, I think that fits with what we've been saying to the market, what we went through at our Investor Day, really looking at earlier stage opportunities that we can bring in either through our own exploration or through partnering with different parties and bringing those forward. That doesn't mean we won't look at operating assets, much like we did with CC&V a few years ago, if we can obtain them at fair value.","Michael Jalonen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Well, thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","Yes, thank you. Gary, are you getting a better sense around the Chaquicocha Oxides and how that fits in between now and Yanacocha Sulfides and how that fits in potentially with Quecher Main?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, at this stage, Quecher Main is progressing well. We hope to see some initial production there later this year. And that's actually doing quite well. We were down there last month visiting. The Oxides is yet to be included in any of our plans. So it'd be something as we put our plans and give our forecasts later this year for 2019 on out that we'd look to include the Oxides, but we continue to see good potential for both the north and the south Chaqui Oxides as we continue to drill and get a better handle on that. So, that would be in addition to what we've already provided in guidance and something that we'll present later this year.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","Quecher Main is a couple of hundred thousand ounces a year and bridges you to Yanacocha Sulfides, this would be over and above that in terms of incremental production.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's the right way to look at it, Greg.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","Any sense of potential there?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","We'll come out with that later this year when we give guidance.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks. Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lucas Pipes of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everybody, and thank you for taking my question. Not to belabor Galore Creek too much, but obviously over the last few years there has been a tremendous amount of uncertainty caused by resource nationalism and obviously Galore Creek safe jurisdiction in British Columbia. To what extent did that play a role in evaluation of this asset and the strategic decision to invest there?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think as you look, we've got a footprint that's in four jurisdictions that allows us to take a look at potential opportunities in all those four jurisdictions. Canada being one and we think this is a good \u2013 it's one of the elements clearly, Lucas, that we do consider when we look at opportunities. So, that was one of the elements.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","But it's not \u2013 I shouldn't read it as a pivot more towards safe jurisdictions you continue to feel comfortable, kind of where you are or do you think maybe the center of gravity could shift a little bit over the coming years.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think we continue to go where the best assets and the best potential profile is. An example is the Medell\u00edn office that we've just opened up in Colombia. We see that as a strategic toehold there towards what we see as an improving situation there and something that looks good. Much like we saw Peru 20 years ago, we see Colombia. So I wouldn't say we're rushing in any certain direction, we're going where it makes sense.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And then on Galore Creek, do you think that the project is more valuable with Teck as a partner or do you think it could maybe make sense for you to go ahead by yourselves?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","No, I think our view is working alongside Teck makes good sense there.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Well, thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Lucas.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for any closing remarks.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you for joining our call this morning. Newmont delivered solid second quarter results. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $1,024 per ounce, in line with our full year guidance.

We also declared an industry-leading dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet and continue to provide more information on our environmental, social and governance performance and our goals for the future.

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. And I would now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.John SeabergThank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's fourth quarter and full-year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Operating Officer, and other members of our executive leadership team who will be available for questions at the end of our call. Including Russell Ball, Chief Financial Officer; Randy Engel, Executive Vice President of Strategic Development; and Grigore Simon, Senior Vice President of Exploration.Turning to slide two. I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement as we will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com.And now I'd like to turn the call over to Gary.Gary GoldbergThanks, John, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the quarterly results I would like to make some introductory comments and spend a few minutes speaking about safety. I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank my predecessor Richard O\u2019Brien, as well as our CFO, Russell Ball. First of all I would like to personally thank Richard for the solid foundation that he has built here at Newmont and I am honored to take the company into the next phase of development.Richard can take great pride in what Newmont has accomplished under his leadership. He has built a solid operational foundation, a talented team and a strong balance sheet. He instilled a more rigorous financial discipline that resulted in industry-leading per share performance in gold reserves, gold production and operating cash flow. He also led the introduction of an innovative gold price linked dividend that gives our shareholders direct leverage to gold price.Similarly, as most of you would have seen last night in our earnings release, Russell Ball, has also decided to step down and will leave Newmont later this year. He plans to continue in his current capacity to ensure a smooth transition as the company seeks its new CFO. I would like to thank Russell for his tireless contributions to Newmont over the better part of the last two decades. Like Richard, Russell can take great pride in Newmont\u2019s accomplishments with his leadership as CFO. Russell helped the company build a solid financial foundation with a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility needed to position Newmont as an industry leader. Thanks to Richard\u2019s and Russell\u2019s hard work, contributions and leadership, Newmont is well positioned for the next stage of its growth and development.Safety is our most important value and I\u2019ll start on slide 3 with a look at our performance. In 2012, we reduced our total injury rate by 6% and the number of serious injuries by 36% compare to 2011. In the last quarter of the year, we achieved a new company record as we drove our total accident frequency rate below 0.5 injuries per 200,000 worked. In 2013, we\u2019ll work to lower our total injury rate by an additional 10% as we move our focus towards our goal of zero harm. Safe operations are productive operations. Conversely, less safe operations create distracted management teams, performance volatility and compound safety risks. Safety has and will continue to be a passion for me and I believe it will deliver economic and social benefits for all Newmont\u2019s stakeholders.Turning to slide 4. We are committed to maximizing value for our shareholders by focusing on mining fundamentals from technical competency to safety and social responsibility. This will lay the groundwork for profitable growth and stronger cash flow generation. Over the next few years we expect capital spending to decrease with the completion of projects such as Akyem in Ghana, Phoenix Copper Leach in Nevada and reduce spending on Conga. These new contributions to our production profile, combined with increased production from Batu Hijau should positively impact Newmont\u2019s free cash flow in 2014 and 2015.Newmont generates over $300 million in after-tax operating cash flow for every $100 increase in the realized gold price. And with our focus on total cost management, we think we can further improve our leverage to gold. We will continue to return capital back to our shareholders, with our gold price linked dividend. Since its introduction in April 2011, we have returned over $1 billion to our shareholders, with another $210 million in distributions planned for the first quarter. We return more cash per share and offer more leverage in our dividend policy than any company in the gold industry. We also plan to maximize value of our assets by maintaining a strong balance sheet, sustaining a dedicated workforce and reducing our total costs.Turning to slide 5, we show Newmont\u2019s all-in sustaining cost under the evolving World Gold Council\u2019s definition for 2012 and 2013. This emphasizes our commitment to managing the total cost of production and providing greater transparency to our stakeholders. Our 2012 all-in sustaining cost of $1,149 per ounce was favorably impacted by $130 million in cost reductions last year. Looking forward, we expect all-in sustaining costs to remain flat from 2012 to 2013. This will be accomplished by reducing our combined general and administrative costs, exploration, advance projects and sustaining capital expenditures by approximately 15% to 20% compared with 2012. These costs will offset a roughly 5% increase in expected 2013 CAS from inflation and the impact of lower grades. This is a step in the right direction, but still is not good enough and one of my key areas of focus will be to reduce these costs even further across all of our operations.On to slide 6. Earlier this week we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.425 per share based on last quarter\u2019s average P.M. Gold Fix of $1,718 per ounce. This equates to a yield of about 4% at our current share price. We are committed to maintaining our gold-linked dividend policy which provides gold leverage without the cost of holding physical gold or ETS.Turning to slide 7. We have a geographically diverse asset portfolio and nearly 100 million ounce reserve base in a land position covering over 75,000 square kilometers. I will highlight each of the regions individually, but the point I want to make is that this scale will support our success for years to come.On slide eight we have summarized our fourth quarter and full year operational performance. Attributable gold production quarter-over-quarter was stable while our year-over-year production was down 4%. For the year, the decrease is a result of continued Phase 6 stripping at Batu Hijau, lower throughput grade and recovery at Tanami, and mine sequencing at Waihi. Copper production for the same two periods was down largely due to the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau. Our gold CAS per ounce was $720 for the quarter, full-year CAS of $677 was within our previously announced range of $670 to $680.The increase of 15% for the year is due to lower production, higher mining and milling costs and lower byproduct credits. Copper CAS per pound increased 86% for the year due to planned lower production as we worked through Phase 6 stripping at Batu Hijau and higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington. We expect copper CAS to improve significantly once we are back in the bottom of the pit at Batu Hijau. Finally, all-in sustaining cost increased for both the quarter and year as higher CAS and lower copper byproduct credits were spread over lower gold production.Our financial results are summarized on slide nine. We continued to generate significant net income and cash flow from operations. Our adjusted net income was approximately $550 million for the quarter and $1.9 billion for the year. We generate cash flow from operations of approximately $850 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. We also continued to return capital to our shareholders with total dividends paid of $1.40 per share. Reported net income was favorably impacted by a gain from discontinued operations, a gain on the sale of assets including the (inaudible) property in Australia as well as some favorable tax benefits due to internal restructuring.Now turning to slide ten. During the fourth quarter, North America's production was lower while performing in line with plans. While Africa's was growing, APAC's production was slightly higher, offset by expected lower production in South America. CAS increased to $720 per ounce due to lower production from North and South America, higher royalties in North America and Africa, and higher waste mining costs in APAC.Turning to slide 11. Our North America region continues to be the big driver of our business, contributing 42% of Newmont's production in the fourth quarter. Full year gold production from North America increased slightly over 2011, to just under $2 million ounces, as we saw higher throughput at Mill 6 and Twin Creeks in Nevada, along with contributions from the new Emigrant leach pad which began production in the third quarter. At La Herradura in Mexico, production was in line with a year ago. North America CAS increased 7% over last year due to higher diesel contracted cost and royalties in Nevada, as well as higher waste tons mined and higher commodity prices at La Herradura.Looking forward, due in part to extremely cold winter weather in Nevada we experienced in December and into January, we are about 30,000 ounces behind plan as of the end of January. We intend to make this production up as the year progresses and we are maintaining our 2013 production outlook for Nevada of between 1.7 million and 1.8 million ounces.Turning to slide 12. We continue to develop the district potential surrounding the Long Canyon deposit in Nevada. Yesterday we reported an initial inferred resource of 2.6 million ounces and we continue to see the long-term district opportunity for 3 to 4 times that initial resource. We have an additional 65,000 meters of drilling plan for 2013. We plan to submit our draft environmental impact study to the BLM at the end of this year and we are continuing with our selection and confirmation study.Moving to slide 13. Yanacocha\u2019s fourth quarter performance was in line with expectations. Full year production was higher than 2011, which favorably impacted CAS. Our 2012 guidance for Yanacocha reflects a 25% decrease in production from 2012. We expect to maintain these production levels for the next few years. Those volume impacts are also reflected in Yanacocha\u2019s 2013 CAS outlook. You\u2019ll see that capital is reduced by more than half due primarily to lower spending at Conga.At Merian, we completed a feasibility study at the end of 2012 and declared reserves of 2.9 million ounces. With those results, we\u2019ve now met the requirements to achieve an ownership interest of 80% of the project. Our investment agreement is now in front of the Suriname\u2019s National Assembly pending its approval, which is expected in the first half of this year.On slide 14, we\u2019re still on track with the water-first approach at Conga. We expect to complete the Chailhuagon reservoir later this year and we are refreshing our approach to stakeholder engagement in the region. Conga will only move forward if we have local community and government support as well as acceptable returns.Moving to slide 15. Our Asia Pacific regions fourth quarter performance was positively impacted by a strong finish at Boddington. Other Australia\/New Zealand production was down due to the lower throughput in greater Tanami as well as lower throughput at Wahi, both of which we had discussed previously. At Boddington and other Australia\/New Zealand CAS increase due to higher strip ratios, higher mill maintenance costs and the impact of the carbon tax being implemented in Australia. Capital expenditure is down in Australia\/New Zealand due to the reassessment of the Tanami shaft project we announced last year.Batu Hijau\u2019s fourth quarter production was impacted by geo-technical issues that we expect to have addressed this month. These issues impacted our weight stripping capability. Full year performance was a function of processing lower grade stockpile material, lower throughputs and recoveries. For 2013, we are separating reporting for APAC into Australia\/New Zealand and Indonesia to align to our management structure. Our outlook for Batu in 2013 is similar to 2012. We are working through the Phase 6 stripping campaign and plan to reach higher grade ore later in 2014. Upon completion of this stripping phase, we expect gold production could increase by as much as 10 times by 2015 over our 2013 outlook.Just a quick update regarding the divestiture process at Batu Hijau. Our current economic interest is still 48.5% and discussions continue with the Indonesian government in regard to divesting the final 7% stake. The fifth extension of the closing deadline of the purchase and sale of this stake was signed in January, extending the deadline to 26 April. Our effective economic interest will be 44.56% once the divestment is complete. We will keep you informed as we look to the Indonesian central government to designate the ultimate purchaser of the divestiture share.Late last year, we also negotiated a new labor agreement in Indonesia in exchange for benefit improvements and wage increases of 3% and 4% in 2013 and 2014 respectively. We negotiated work practice changes that will positively impact safety and productivity. We employed a good process around the negotiations with great cooperation from all involved and specific goals we hope to achieve. I would like to offer my compliments to the management and worker representatives involved in the negotiations.On slide 16, Ahafo contributed 561,000 ounces of production in 2012, in line with 2011. CAS was up from a year ago, primarily as a result of higher labor, commodity and royalty costs. Capital costs are up in 2013 as we complete the construction of Akyem.On slide 17, Africa\u2019s production is expected to grow over the next few years, primarily through the development of Akyem where we expect production to begin in late 2013. I had the opportunity to visit Akyem last week and I am happy to report that we remain on schedule and on budget to meet the target. In addition to reviewing construction and mining progress, I had the chance to visit with some of our Akyem apprentices, you can see here in the picture in the lower right. These young men and women are from the ten local communities that surround the project and are in various stages of their four year training program. Once their training is complete they will fill various skilled positions at Akyem.Moving on to slide 18. We are pleased to report that we have covered depletion and increased our gold reserve base to 99.2 million ounces. Our reserves were calculated at $1400 gold, up from $1200 gold last year, which added about 1.5 million ounces due to the higher gold price. Additions come primarily from North and South America, in particular at Merian and Leeville-Turf. Revisions came from Boddington, Tanami, Ahafo, and Twin Creeks.As part of our total cost management effort, we reduced 2012 exploration spending by 12%. In 2013, we will trim exploration cost by a further 25% compared to 2012 as we focus on our best opportunities. On slide 19, you will that copper reserves were calculated at $3.25 per pound in 2012 compared to $3 per pound in 2011. Copper reserves decreased to 9.5 billion pounds as we depleted reserves from production without significant additions.Turning to the final slide. Newmont has turned in a good performance in 2012 but we can and we will do better. I have been in mining for 30 years and at Newmont for just over one. What I would like to do is share a few observations about the sector and my vision for the company as I take up the reins as CEO. Like all gold miners we face significant headwinds. First, input and labor costs are rising and the cost of getting an ounce of gold out of the ground has doubled in the past five years.Second, the industry has a tradition of chasing reserves growth rather than cash flow. Third, new deposits are expensive to develop and in increasingly difficult jurisdictions. As an industry, our total return performance has been poor. Especially against the backdrop of more than a decade of year-on-year gold price increases. Our investors and our board understandably expect to see better returns and so do our management and our employees. I see these trends as a call to arms for me and for Newmont. We have a tradition of creating wealth to shareholders, delivering value from our assets and working safely and responsibly in tough operating environments. None of that will change on my watch.However, we are not content to stay in the middle of the pack and business as usual is not an option. Our cash flow potential is strong, our cost cutting program is gaining momentum and we are making real progress and tightening our capital discipline. We also have a solid asset portfolio, reserve base and team. This is why I am excited about Newmont and you should be too. But I am also excited about making some changes that will help us breakout of that pack. Our attention to safety is good but we need to get better. We are shift the managerial focus of the business to maximizing our profitability and I intend to inject a much greater sense of urgency into how we do that. We need to change the trajectory on our cost and productivity.We have been increasing the rigor of our capital allocation processes. I am saying no to capital requests quite regularly and we will continue to do so until our business cases warrant funding. We need to built flexibility into our plans so that we can manage through the inevitable gold price changes without needing to make kneejerk adjustments. In this context, our shift to a total cost focus is a better reflection of our true performance. I continue to be impressed by the commitment and hard work of our employees and contractors. And I know they will support me in achieving these goals. On this note, I would like to recognize the accounting, finance, tax and internal audit teams who have put out an extraordinary effort this time of year.I know that our investors appreciate timely, quality audited financial statements, as do I. To sum it up, I want to build a Newmont that regularly delivers on expectations and is focused on execution. I know you will need to see some results before you\u2019re ready to credit Newmont for delivering on its full potential, but I invite you to watch this space.Thank you very much and I\u2019d like to open it up for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions). Our first question today is from John Bridges from JPMC.John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co.You laid out succinctly all the challenges the industry is facing. Just wondered how you felt that your policies would differ from those of Richard and Russell who we congratulate and wish best of luck in their new endeavors. Any comments on that?Gary GoldbergSure thing, John and I appreciate the question. I think first of all I\u2019m building off of the great foundation that they\u2019ve helped to build here over their years of service at Newmont. I clearly come with an operating background and years of experience in a variety of businesses, but had my start here in the copper business in Utah in some difficult times. I started when Bingham Canyon had 7,000 employees and five years later we had 90 employees. So I\u2019ve seen the swings and roundabout and with that comes an experience base that really wants and helps me focus people on looking at the long term in terms of delivering value which is not different than Richard, but it really brings a push for me on that. And also making sure you\u2019re prepared for the inevitable swings we\u2019re going to get along the way. You\u2019re seeing the focus and continue to see the focus on safety and safety results. I think the approach to capital rigor and how we go through and assess projects and make sure that we\u2019ve got good, sound technical basis, the reserves, the right plans in place to be able to effect value are some of the areas that you\u2019ll begin to see. So carrying it is in some ways heightened, but it also brings my experience base to the fore.John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co.Well, I hope by giving that detail of the employment fall at Utah you haven\u2019t given any of your people heart attacks. I wonder if you \u2013 just as a follow up, a geology question, Long Canyon has been \u2013 the ounces have been slow to come. I wonder if you could detail a little bit as to why that\u2019s happening and why it\u2019s taking so long. Thank you.Gary GoldbergThanks John. Just so I don\u2019t give anyone a heart attack, that was a significant decrease in price. We closed Utah Copper. As you look today it\u2019s running pretty well. Moving on to the Long Canyon question, actually the reserve, actually the resource that we reported is in line with what we would have expected at this phase in development. We\u2019ve got a lot of drilling which we said we needed to do when we acquired the asset. We continue to do the drilling. So it\u2019s not out of line with what our expectations are for being able to announce resource at this stage. We continue to work through the different phases of the process, but it also I would expect it\u2019s going to take a number of years to get to where we do expect to achieve the final numbers that we painted as the potential future. Right now our focus is making sure we have what\u2019s an appropriate amount of reserves to be able to declare when we begin production. So that\u2019s really where our focus is now. But I also want to make sure people are aware of the full potential of the deposit. So it\u2019s not just putting drilling in to fill up the resource bank. It\u2019s putting it in where we need to put it in and it will come with time.John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co.Excellent. Congratulations on the results and replacing your reserves. Thank you.OperatorOur next question is from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank.Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AGGood morning, Gary. My question is just following up a little bit on the exploration front and in terms of the return that you\u2019re seeing on the exploration dollars that Newmont\u2019s been spending quite heavily in the past few years. I think if we strip out the gold price effect, you\u2019ll agree that there wasn\u2019t that much change in actual proven and probable for Newmont year on year. And I was just wondering about your thinking in terms of if you\u2019d still rather be heavily funding that kind of expenditure or if you\u2019d rather put the money into other things. And if you could also comment about this Tanami shaft project being suspended, if that\u2019s along the lines of the capital rigor you\u2019re talking about.Gary GoldbergOkay. First on reserves and thanks for the question, Jorge. Clearly that\u2019s why we\u2019re transparent about what the gold price increase is, so yes, without that increase it would have been about even from year-to-year. But a lot of good hard work has been done by the exploration team to get to the additions that you see there. And I see that as a very effective, cost effective way for us to add to our reserve and resource bank going forward. So Grigore and his team and a number of us spent a lot of time last year, taking a look at our priorities and making sure that we are focused on where we think are the best areas to put the money and the most effective ways to spend our exploration dollars.So I have looked at it as a bit of belt tightening. Making sure we are effectively spending the monies that we do have targeted. So I do see this as a continued important part for our future. In regards to the Tanami shaft, last year we announced that we are really putting that whole project on hold, pending the ability to make sure we delivered good operating results. So we made that decision last year and I do see that as part of the capital rigor. It's important that we get the good returns on our existing assets before we make the investment and further expansions.Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AGThank you. And may be if you could also comment a little bit about your move to this cost, all-in cost as is generally in the industry now. Could you talk maybe about the other side of the equation as well? I think that perhaps we are focusing too much on the numerator and not the denominator which I am also trying to understand from companies. The all-in invested capital, do you see any push from the industry to start to be more forthcoming about what ultimately goes in projects both in terms of land value and CapEx.Gary GoldbergYeah, I think first of all, my view of it, and that comes back to the rigor we put into the investment analysis. We take a look and clearly we are NPV driven. We have a view on gold price that goes in and we have ways that we go through those different analysis and look at the ups and downs. I think we are pretty transparent, Jorge, in what we provide to the market and what we expect the development capital cost to those projects to be. I think the other piece, and one of the things that I am looking to drive not only all-in sustaining cost but what's the return on capital employed, and getting those numbers out in front and across the business. It is a critical metric that I am used to using and we are using here at Newmont.Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AGGreat. Well, I look forward to more of that disclosure about the return on capital employed on a go-forward basis. Thank you.OperatorYour next question is from Patrick Chidley from HSBC.Patrick Chidley - HSBCGary, I just wanted to ask you about where you see cost pressures this year going forward. Are they labor, are they energy, are they reagents, for example. And a follow-up question to that is, where do you see productivity improvements in Newmont. Given your [present] experience there and given your past experience in the mining industry, do you see Newmont as -- do you see any low hanging fruit there in terms of productivity or is it just really quite tough?Gary GoldbergOkay. Thanks for both questions, Patrick. In regards to where we are seeing the cost pressures, I think clearly labor costs which tie back to your question on productivity, are related. The changes you saw in our contract at Batu Hijau reflect a real effort by the team there. To make sure that we share with our employees what the business case is and what the issues are that we face at each of the operations in regards to cost. So making sure people are aware of the issues that the industry faces within our businesses, an important part I think of managing that cost effectively so that we do control. So that\u2019s one piece you see and I think that\u2019s our job to manage that piece.The second piece in regards to increase in cost, probably cyanide is cost is one that we see a bit of an uptick more this year and it's one we are working with our global supply chain team to look at how we manage and how we might approach it differently. But I think, with my background, and I was involved in some global supply chain deals with my past employer, I think there is some opportunities there to look at how we do contracting. I think we have done a good job historically but I think it's time to revisit those things again across the business.In regards to productivity, we have launched a process and it's begun at Boddington, that we are calling our full potential process to review costs really from the mine plan right through gold production. Including G&A costs, all the operating costs and productivity. That began last month. I will actually be visiting Boddington here in another week to see how that process is proceeding. But the plan is to begin there using our internal experts as well as a little outside assistance. But looking at what we can do to really extract the full potential from the business. So I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s easy, low hanging fruit by any means. You\u2019ve got to work at this in this business, but we\u2019ve got to get on with it. We\u2019ve got the process going and the plan is to roll that across all of our regions through the course of this year.Patrick Chidley - HSBCAnd just a follow up. I know Newmont had for many years quite a significant technology investment and technology center there in Denver and I\u2019m wondering if anything has come out of that in terms of new technology that might bring down costs in future at the mines.Gary GoldbergPatrick, that\u2019s one area we\u2019re always looking at. I think we invest both in new innovation as well as making sure we\u2019re applying existing technologies effectively. We\u2019ve made some changes in management there just recently. We have Scott Lawson who\u2019s joined as our Senior Vice President of Technical Services and with that we\u2019re combining with the technical group here in Denver the business excellence group so that we really combine those resources and in fact the project I mentioned, the full potential is being resourced out of Scott\u2019s team. So we do look at that. I think there\u2019s some things we can apply. I know we\u2019ve had a team over to take a look at the operation center in Perth that Rio Tinto runs to take a look at how we might apply that at our Nevada operation. So we are taking a look at those sorts of things, but probably more so not bleeding edge technology changes, but fast follower.Patrick Chidley - HSBCJust one final question. Just can you just confirm or re-confirm that the focus of Newmont is still on gold and you wouldn\u2019t be thinking about diversification?Gary GoldbergI think, you look at where 90% of our revenues come from our focus is clearly on gold. I know I\u2019ve got a background in coal, but I\u2019m not going that direction.OperatorOur next question is from Mike Jalonen from Bank of America.Michael Jalonen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchGary, welcome aboard there and I guess officially March 1 and your new role. But this is question on Merian. I know that you have a reserve feasibility study. I guess could you share with us any capital costs, production costs for Merian for that feasibility study?Gary GoldbergAt this stage we\u2019re still going through the process of reviewing the results of that feasibility study internally. We actually have our investment review process which will come forward here in another \u2013 for detailed review here in another month. I did have the benefit of visiting there a couple of weeks ago and looking at this potential operating sites. Along with it I visited the Rosebel operations of Iamgold just to get a flavor of what it\u2019s like to operate in Suriname and I\u2019ve got to say I\u2019m really impressed with the work that our team has done on the ground in understanding this resource and what we might be able to do with it. So we\u2019re working with the government. As you may or may not know, the government would be a partner in this project going forward or at least has the opportunity to become a partner and getting the investment agreement details reviewed and approved by their parliament is the next phase in that process.Michael Jalonen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchJust one quick question. What kind of infrastructure would you need for Merian once you make a go ahead decision? Power lines, whatever?Gary GoldbergYeah. The power and our power situation is a little different than Iamgold\u2019s because they get power off the grid. We would be independent of the grid because we\u2019re located away from the grid. So it just doesn\u2019t make sense to build the power line there. So we would be powering through our own self generation at the site.OperatorOur next question is from Greg Barnes from TD Securities.Greg Barnes \u2013 TD SecuritiesJust want to get a better feel for how Yanacocha is going to evolve over the next several years. I know you said production would be maintained at 2013 levels for a couple of years. What happens after that?Gary GoldbergGood question, Greg. I think a couple of things as we look at Yanacocha and Yanacocha has really been founded on all the oxide deposits there and we\u2019ve been both milling and leaching as you know for almost two decades. As we look to the future, the amount of oxide deposits are decreasing, but we\u2019ve got a fantastic sulfide resource. So we\u2019re looking at where we can take that and expand that and it\u2019s not just gold. We also have copper there too. So we\u2019re going through a variety of things. One of the projects we\u2019re doing right now is a test of bio leaching for copper recovery from the sulfide copper deposit. So lot of technical work going in too because of the quality of some of the reserves and basically the arsenic that would be in some of the concentrates if we were to produce the copper or gold concentrate, to make sure that we can properly process it and cost effective, we obviously do that as well. At the same time we have got to Conga where I mentioned we are continuing with the water first project there. But looking at the ability to get through the social acceptance, and a lot of work is going on in the ground there. We have made some changes with management and we have moved our headquarters up to Cajamarca, which I think is an important place for us to be located because it's an important for the overall business going forward there in Peru.So I think that\u2019s critical for us as we look at getting the social acceptance we need to be on the ground. And then clearly we have got to hit the financial numbers. So how that all fits together is part of the work we are doing here this year and as we re-prioritize where Conga fits into that mix.Greg Barnes \u2013 TD SecuritiesYanacocha [process] then, does production step down in stages over the next five or six years?Gary GoldbergYeah, we have really taken a step this year to realign based on what our reserve base looks on the oxide deposits and then look at how we will supplement that through some satellite oxide deposits and then fill in with the sulfides I mentioned after that.OperatorYour next question is from Stephen Walker from RBC Capital Markets.Stephen Walker - RBC Capital MarketsGary, two questions. The first is a follow-up to Mike's question on Merion. Where are you in the process of negotiating with the government and are there any milestones here in the near-term that we could expect from those negotiations. And then as a part of that, if you were to get negotiations with the government finalized and an [operating] agreement in hand, how long would it take for the board or at what stages it at with respect to board approval and construction start?Gary GoldbergOkay. In regards to the government negotiations, we have actually been through a very productive set of negotiations with the government. We have reached an agreement and that agreement is what's in front of the parliament for approval. The government is going through a process of vetting that with various parties, and it's not a process that has a specific timeline to it that\u2019s why I say we hope to see it by midyear. But I know that the government and the different parties are actively reviewing that. So I think the milestone really is the parliament's approval.In regards to board approval, obviously having the government approval is a critical piece. Permits is a critical piece, but most importantly having the financial returns that justify the investment is the critical piece that we would be putting in front of the board. So that could come as early as the first half of this year or it could go into the second half of this year. And then once we get that approval, as soon as we get that approval, we would move right on in. The team is set up and has looked at different ways to execute and begin construction of that project, which is not an extremely long time. I think from the time we get all the necessary approvals, we are looking at about a two-year window to get that developed and get first production.Stephen Walker - RBC Capital MarketsGreat. Thank you for that. And just a second question. On Batu Hijau there is going to be a fairly material impact as you finish the way stripping phase here and going to the higher grade copper-gold, gold-copper core again. Can you give us a sense over the next 24-36 months sort of the ramp up and the tail-off, of how that material gets blended into the mine sequence.Gary GoldbergYeah. It's probably more complex to do over the phone than with a little picture. But I think we do start to run in to [deposits] of the higher grade ore and some of the sub-grade ore along the way and we will be processing that through a little bit here in '13 and we run into more of that in '14, until the end of '14 when we get into really the full ore body. So you will see bits of it start to show up more in '14 and it will really grow through '14 and then '15 will be into the full new ore, fresh ore.OperatorAnd your next question is from Tanya Jakusconek from Scotia Bank.Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia BankRichard, Russell, just wanted to wish you the best for your future endeavors and welcome Gary. I wanted to come back to Yanacocha. I am just looking at the reserves that you currently have in place and assuming that we keep it just sort of stable production level, it looks like we only really have four years left of the mine life, including that\u2019s maybe a bit longer with the stockpile. I\u2019m just wondering, are there any results from the pilot plant testing that was being done on the Yanacocha sulfides and what\u2019s the status of Cerro Quilish? I think we used to have a resource of over 2 million ounces there. Just wondered where that was and yeah, maybe just that.Gary GoldbergOkay. Well, in regards to the pilot plan testing, we\u2019re in the final stages of completing the pilot plant and then it takes a good year to 18 months to run effective tests to make sure we get the recoveries. We've had great lab results and pilot scale, what we call column leach test to confirm recoveries and actually it looks quite attractive from that standpoint. But we need to go through this process of confirming through building and these aren\u2019t small leach pads. These are million ton leach pads that we\u2019re building to be able to test that we are able to get the recovery. So I would see that\u2019s still out about 18 months. We'll get indications earlier, but that's still about that long.Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia BankAnd maybe just coming back on Cerro Quilish, where are we on that deposit?Gary GoldbergYes. Sorry. In regards to Quilish, Quilish is still a resource that's there, but it's not one that we have in our current development plans. We, as you may know, we had issues in looking to develop it at one point in time and actually have made a commitment to the local communities not to pursue that at this time. So we\u2019re still keeping with that commitment.Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia BankOkay. So that's not one of these ones that you're looking in terms of supplementing then for the \u2013 when Yanacocha oxides fade off?Gary GoldbergThat's correct.Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia BankWould it be fair to say then, Gary, that we're looking at a four year mine life and a little bit longer on the stockpiles at Yanacocha if we kept this current rate?Gary GoldbergIf we were to not have any success with the sulfides which I'm still confident, the team is working on and has good potential to extend, that's correct.OperatorOur next question is from Garrett Nelson from BB&T Capital Markets.Garrett Nelson \u2013 BB&T Capital MarketsYou've obviously made a significant cut to the CapEx budget versus what the company spent last year, but development CapEx still represents about 40% of the total. Will you continue to take a look at the returns on these growth projects or should we consider the CapEx guidance a definitive total of what's been approved and what you plan to spend this year?Gary GoldbergYeah. Thanks Garrett. I think in terms of the projects that we have going out there, clearly, Akyem is coming on board later this year and that one's going to move through the completion. The Phoenix Copper Leach project, also looking for later this year to come on. You've seen the decision made with Tanami and I think that's the right thing, but I've done the scan across all of our operations and we'll continue to do and put the rigor behind assessing our capital investments and development capital investments to make sure we get the return on capital that we need to do the projects.","OperatorOur next question is from Dave Hove from Stifel.Dave Hove \u2013 Stifel NicolausGood morning, Gary. My question is first on the $700 million for the exploration in advanced projects. What are the major \u2013 which projects are the major consumers of this expense and how should we think about it going forward? I know for 2013 the guidance is $600 million to $700 million?Gary GoldbergI\u2019m sorry. Just a minute.Russell BallSo your question is the combined exploration in advanced projects of $600 million to $700 million in total, correct?Dave Hove \u2013 Stifel NicolausYes.Unidentified Company RepresentativeSo we expect that in the next few years we have opportunities, particularly in the advanced projects area to tighten up our spending there as well. That's part of our overall effort to reduce total costs. And I think as you see, the capital discipline that Gary has been referencing throughout the call, advanced projects is probably one of the areas that we have some additional opportunities.Dave Hove \u2013 Stifel NicolausSo right now, which are the major projects which consume that?Unidentified Company RepresentativeThe major project to consume most of our advanced projects you\u2019re going to see some of the projects in Africa, the likes of Subika. You\u2019re going to see some of the projects in Nevada, the likes of Long Canyon. Those are going to be the two main areas where you'll see advanced project spending.Gary GoldbergAnd a little bit in the Long as well in Indonesia would be the other one I would put in there. Sorry, Dave, I haven't picked up where you are pointing with the number.Dave Hove \u2013 Stifel NicolausAll right. Not a problem. Okay. Then a second question on Long Canyon, how much was spent for exploration there in 2012 and what is the budget there for 2013.Gary GoldbergOkay. I've got Grigore here to give an update on that.Grigore SimonHi Dave. Yes, this is Grigore. We have spent $12 million in exploration at Long Canyon and for 2013 we have $16 million allocated.Dave Hove \u2013 Stifel NicolausOkay. And are the development plans still for -- I think there was a date before 2017 or something like that, it is still part of your plan?Gary GoldbergYes, that\u2019s still the plan in terms of once we're submitting the permit later this year to the BLM, and we would expect that the timing of that review plus our own, obviously, internal reviews of the capital approvals would target first production in 2017.OperatorOur next question is from Michael Dudas from Sterne Agee.Michael Dudas - Sterne AgeeGary, how do you think about, going forward how you and the board are going to allocate for external investment opportunities? Is it going to differ much than what Newmont has done over the past few years? And on the other side, have you gone through a full review, I know you are going to start I guess officially next week, of the asset base and the reserves? And how much more opportunities there would be monetization or joint ventures or outright asset sales as you're trying to improve those capital returns?Gary GoldbergOkay. Thanks for that. I think in terms of external opportunities, we always scan the horizon but at this moment there's nothing that's on our radar screen. So I think that's where I'd put it. I'm also sensitive to having been involved in the mining industry for 30 years to how those things work and how you deliver value from those things, and that's important. I think the internal portfolio, it is something I've spent the last year looking at and looking at where our business is set. I've heard a lot of talk out in the industry of people looking to dispose off assets and with all of these eager people that are out there to buy them. My approach is to understand your assets, understand where the issues are, give the teams an opportunity to address those where we are on the high-end of the cost side, and work through that in the first instance before looking at what we might do in terms of asset disposal. So that's the approach you'd see for me in this process. But clearly, you've got to take a look at what's delivering versus what's not delivering and get after it.Michael Dudas - Sterne AgeeSo we think that'd be a 2013 process for you or could we, maybe have something from you sooner than that.Gary GoldbergAll right. I think from my standpoint, it's a process that's ongoing in terms of assessing the performance of our portfolio.Michael Dudas - Sterne AgeeAnd finally, the longer term outlook for production from what Newmont put out last year, are you willing to still commit to that or is that something again as evolving as you are figuring things out, and what targets would be going forward relative to your re-found focus on rates of return on invested capital.Gary GoldbergI know our longer term view showed a range of 6 million to 7 million ounces. And I think the key piece that goes with that is it's got to be profitable production and that's the focus that we have within the business. So as we review that and review our longer term plans, we'd let people know if that changes that range, but really our focus is on profitable production going forward.Michael Dudas - Sterne AgeeTerrific. Just wondering if I could get a gold price forecast from Russell before he leaves?Russell BallThanks for that, Mike. Long-term bullish as ever, short-term clearly some headwinds, lot of liquidation. Maybe what are you seeing is some -- we can't [big] margin called out. But, yeah, we can't run this business on the quarters, Mike, and long-term we're still very bullish. The fundamentals are there and it's just a question of time before the debt issues start rearing the head again.OperatorYour next question is from Brian MacArthur from UBS.Brian MacArthur - UBSI just want to go back to Batu Hijau for a minute. You did make a comment about potentially getting the final 7% settle down where you'd end up with 44% afterwards. Has anything changed with price given all the discussions in Indonesia about new taxes, whatever? Is that a fixed in stone prices that drags on or what's the update? Or we're just still waiting for them to tell you who you can sell it to?Gary GoldbergBrian, I'm going to hand that over to Russ to address.Russell BallHe gives me all the fun ones here. Yeah, we have a contractual price. However, I\u2019d submit in reality there's been a lot of order under the bridge over the last two years. If you think about it even the four month dividends out or capital reinvested. So at this stage we have a firm contractual commitment. As Gary mentioned earlier we have continued to renegotiate that. I'd say that when this transaction closes, or I should say if and when this transaction closes there will be a further discussion around price, I have no doubt in my mind.Brian MacArthur - UBSOkay. And maybe just a follow-up in that. So again we're going to finish the stripping, we're going to go under the bottom pit, have lots of good years through '14, 15, '16. Maybe just a comment on what the longer-term view is on Batu Hijau and obviously it will depend on all these other things, but structurally what the view is there. Has that changed? We talked about Elang everything else. Just what may be your views are on that, Gary?Gary GoldbergYeah. I think, clearly there's a Phase 7 stripping process to come in behind. So that is one that we're evaluating clearly the economics, but right now it would look attractive to come in and following behind with that, looking at the timing, we'll still have what we've gone through this last time. We're going to through a period of feast and then a period of working through the stockpile. Elang is one that we continue to drill. I was out at site last year to take a look at what's there. Great resource, but how we put that into practice will be the one that we\u2019ve got to work through here over the next year or two and figure out what to do and what the next steps might be there.OperatorAnd our final question today is from Robert Reynolds from Credit Suisse.Robert Reynolds \u2013 Credit SuisseJust to go back again to Batu Hijau. I'm wondering, you mentioned of course 2015 you'll be into the full ore. How does the production look in comparison to these high stripping years once you\u2019re back into the full?Gary GoldbergI\u2019ll hand that to Russ.Russell BallRobert, if you go back and look at Phase 5, and I think it was 2009 and 2010, you'll get an indication order of magnitude. As Gary said, it very much is feasible for them at Batu. The last time we were in the bottom of the pit was 2009 and 2010 and that will give you an indication as to what that middle looks like. Obviously there's mining variation when you get down to the bottom. It is interesting, as you get into the bottom it is far more gold dominant than copper. So you tend to see the relative weighting of gold increase significantly when you are in the bottom of the pit.Robert Reynolds \u2013 Credit SuisseOkay. So the similar grade to those years or is that \u2013 will that change?Russell BallYeah. I'd say plus or minus 10% to 15%, it will give you an idea of what it'll look like.Robert Reynolds \u2013 Credit SuisseOkay. And then just moving to Boddington, the measured and indicated resource there declined by about 3 million ounces. I\u2019m just wondering if you could comment on what happened there.Gary GoldbergYeah. Happy to take that one on. Bottom-line, it's the cost increases we've been experiencing in the business that we took into account in calculating the resource and we had to make a reduction. These are marginal ounces as you can imagine at this gold price that dropped out. So that's what caused the reduction.Robert Reynolds \u2013 Credit SuisseWere those ounces, would they require significantly more stripping than the ounces currently in the reserves or is it just the lower grade?Gary GoldbergIt's significantly more stripping. It would be basically the next shale in an ultimate pit if you were to look at it that way.Robert Reynolds \u2013 Credit SuisseOkay. And then a final question on Waihi. Is the golden link mine life extension, is that still in your plans?Gary GoldbergYes. We\u2019re still moving ahead with that at this stage.OperatorThank you. And I would now like to turn the call back to the speakers for closing remarks.Gary GoldbergOkay. Well, thank you everybody. I appreciate all your questions and your patience here as I go through my inaugural earnings announcement here with the Group. I really just want to come back and re-emphasize the appreciation I have for both Richard and Russell and their contributions, the team that's been putting together all the numbers that we go through here at the year-end, and most importantly, to all the employees and contractors across Newmont for all your efforts to continue to work safely. I am looking forward to next week at BMO and a chance to talk more with our investors about the future and great future here at Newmont. Thanks very much.OperatorThank you and this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"15416":["Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) Q4 2013 Results Earnings Conference Call February 21, 2014  8:00 AM ET","Executives","Kirsten Benefiel - Senior Director, Investor Relations","Gary Goldberg - President and CEO","Laurie Brlas - CFO","Chris Robison - Executive Vice President of Operations and Projects","Randy Engel - Executive Vice President of Strategic Development ","","Analysts","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Brian Yu - Citigroup","John Bridges - JPMorgan","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Market","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the call over to Kirsten Benefiel, senior director of investor relations. Thank you, you may begin.","","Kirsten Benefiel"," ","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, president and chief executive officer; Laurie Brlas, chief financial officer; Chris Robison, executive vice president of operations and projects; and Randy Engel, executive vice president of strategic development. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of our call.","Turning to slide two, I\u2019d like to refer you to our cautionary statement. We will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks. More information is included in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","Now, please turn to page three, and I will turn the call over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Kirsten, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. I welcome this opportunity to highlight the strong results our team delivered in 2013, for maximizing production and exceeding cost reduction targets, to bringing profitable new projects online and divesting noncore assets. I also want to help you understand Newmont\u2019s potential in the years ahead. ","My goal is to clearly explain our stable production profile and the substantial cost reductions we are committed to achieving, and give you more specifics on what we have done to scrutinize and optimize our project pipeline. ","Finally, I will delineate the specific steps we have taken to improve our financial flexibility by modifying our dividend policy and securing commitments to restructure our debt. Let me make our capital allocation priorities crystal clear: they are to maintain financial flexibility, invest in our top development prospects, and return capital to shareholders, in that order.","The first record result for 2013 I will touch on is safety. Turning to slide four, safety is fundamental to running an efficient business, and in 2013, we achieved our lowest total injury rate on record. In human terms, this means that compared to 2012, 176 people did not get injured, 36 did not miss work due to an injury, and nine avoided a serious injury.","In business terms, a strong safety record means we are operating at peak efficiency. Safety and social responsibility are at the heart of our employee value proposition and help us to attract and retain the best and the brightest. ","Now I want to review the value proposition we offer investors, turning to slide five. Newmont is the premiere U.S. based gold mining company, and the value we offer shareholders is grounded in our operational, financial, and strategic acumen. ","Starting with our operations, we have a strong asset portfolio with 70% of our production derived from Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. We are managing our portfolio to deliver stable production of about 5 million ounces of gold per year over the next three years, with 90% of our revenues coming from gold.","We are also relentless in our work to improve costs and efficiency. I brought in two world-class mining experts and tasked them delivering a step change in operational performance: Chris Robison, our head of operations, and Scott Lawson, our head of technical services. They were responsible for leading our team to achieve cost reductions of nearly $1 billion in 2013 and we will apply that same expertise and discipline to achieve at least another $600 million to $700 million in savings from 2014 to 2016.","Turning to our balance sheet, we have taken decisive action to maintain financial flexibility in a challenging price environment. Our new CFO, Laurie Brlas, is also a mining veteran, and led our efforts to reschedule our debt payments and revise our dividend policy to improve financial flexibility. Laurie\u2019s job is to keep us focused on delivering against our capital allocation commitments.","One further point of clarification, we do not believe that issuing equity to pay off debt is a sound business practice, and we have no intention to do so.","Finally, we have reevaluated and reinforced our approach to maximizing the value of our investments and our portfolio. You all know Randy Engel, our head of strategic development. Randy has established a more rigorous approach to screening assets and opportunities based on their contribution to value, as measured by NPV and return on capital employed and mine life, as well as their impact on our portfolio cost and risk profile. ","We now view everything through this lens, which has helped us to prioritize our best organic development opportunities and move forward with divesting assets that are not a good fit with our strategy. We realized nearly $600 million by divesting noncore assets in 2013. ","With that clarification on how we create value, I\u2019ll turn to the specifics on what we delivered in 2013. Turning to slide six, last year we committed to improving costs and efficiencies by $500 million to $750 million by 2015 and delivering on our production goals. I am pleased to say that the team met and exceeded these commitments.","First, we lowered consolidated spending by $966 million compared to 2012 and reduced our all-in sustaining costs by 6%. This was critically important in light of the 16% reduction in gold price we experienced last year. Second, we achieved the top end of our gold production guidance of 5.1 million ounces. ","Third, we brought our Akyem and Phoenix copper leach projects into full commercial production. We\u2019ve all seen a lot of mining projects run over on costs and schedule. I am proud of our team for delivering these two projects safely, on time, and on budget, and for the work that they did to reevaluate and optimize our project portfolio in 2013 so we can maintain this industry leading standard.","Finally, the flipside of building a stronger portfolio is divesting assets that no longer fit the strategy. As I mentioned, we realized nearly $600 million in 2013 by divesting noncore assets, and this work continues. Drilling into the specifics of our cost performance on slide seven, we reduced our consolidated spending by 14% or nearly $1 billion in 2013. This figure excludes impacts related to stockpile and ore on leach pad writedowns, which Laurie will address later.","As you can see on this chart, sustaining capital reductions are the largest component of this reduction at $702 million. The next largest reduction was in our advanced projects and exploration area, where we reduced spending by $235 million. It\u2019s important to note that these are sustainable improvements. We aren\u2019t just deferring our spend to a future date. I also want to underline the fact that we still have more value to extract in this area.","Turning to slide eight, for details on our 2013 production performance, we increased gold production slightly in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily through very strong fourth quarter production in Nevada, and particularly in Africa, with steadily increasing production in Australia and New Zealand due mainly to productivity improvements at Tanami and higher grades at Waihi, and consistent delivery in South America.","In addition to delivering on our production commitments, we delivered the two new projects on time and on budget at Akyem and Phoenix copper leach, which will produce about 400,000 ounces of gold and 9,000 tons of copper, respectively, in 2014.","Finally, we began work on our turf vent shaft in Nevada in 2013. This project will add up to 150,000 ounces of gold production per year, starting in late 2015, by providing access to higher grade ore at lower costs. Lower prices in 2013 affected our reserves and resources, but we also improved our average grades, turning to slide nine. ","We declared total gold reserves of 88.4 million ounces in 2013, down from 99.2 million ounces in 2012. Reserves were calculated at $1,300 per ounce, down from $1,400 last year. The positive effect of our sharper focus on value was a 7% improvement in the average gold grade of the reserve base. ","We came close to offsetting depletion by adding more than 5 million ounces of quality gold reserves, including 1.1 million ounces at Tanami, 1 million ounces at Long Canyon, and 500,000 ounces at Merian, all at grades higher than our business average. ","Copper reserves decreased from 4,300 tons to about 3,700 tons, mainly due to plan revisions at Boddington and lower prices. Copper reserves were calculated at $3 per pound in 2013 compared to $3.25 a pound in 2012. ","We also improved the value of our project pipeline in 2013. Turning to slide 10, our short term project pipeline includes investment opportunities that represent more than 1.5 million ounces of production at competitive costs. The most advanced include Merian, in Suriname, where we recently signed a mineral agreement with the government and improved project economics.","This project represents an additional 400,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold and we will decide whether to proceed in the second quarter of 2014. This project is value accretive, and gives us a foothold in the highly prospective Guyana Shield area.","Long Canyon is the only major gold discovery in Nevada in the last decade. In 2014, we will complete feasibility studies for an optimized and reduced capital phase one mine that could deliver approximately 150,000 ounces of annual production. We expect to reach a decision to proceed in early 2015.","Finally, we are exploring two expansion projects in Ghana, the Ahafo Mill expansion would optimize throughput and help counter the impact of the lower-grade ore we are currently mining. This investment could add approximately 200,000 ounces of annual gold production. The Subika underground mine would improve ore grade and could add approximately 200,000 of gold production annually.","We will reach a decision to proceed with either one, both, or some combination of these projects in 2015. I also want to give you more specifics on our exploration pipeline. Turning to slide 11, while we\u2019ve reduced our exploration spend, we have certainly not abandoned this core capabilities. In fact, of forecasted 2014 production, 75% was discovered by Newmont geologists.","Our strategy is to focus on high-value opportunities, from near mine to generative exploration. A few examples of exceptionally high grade finds include Exodus and Bull Moose, which are near our existing Carlin underground mines in Nevada; Maqui Maqui, which is within our Yanacocha operations in Peru; Subika Underground, which is directly beneath the Subika open pit in Ghana; and Federation, which is adjacent to our Tanami operation. These prospects are expected to add higher grade materials to our inventory in 2014. It\u2019s still early days, and we\u2019ll keep you informed about our progress. ","Before turn it over to Laurie, I\u2019ll provide a brief update on Indonesia, on slide 12. As you know, Indonesia\u2019s proposed export ban on copper concentrates has been postponed from 2014 until 2017. In its place, the government has introduced new regulations on export permit conditions and a progressive export tax that is in direct conflict with our contract of work.","We continue to meet with government officials to seek clarity and a mutually acceptable resolution. Earlier this week, the Gresik smelter resumed operation after a maintenance shutdown, and we expect to ship our first concentrate to them next week. We also have contingency plans and other remedies in place if we cannot resolve our differences. Our ultimate goal is to restore stability in the short term and protect asset value in the long term. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Laurie to discuss our financial performance. ","Laurie Brlas","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll begin on slide 14. As you can see from the results we reported last night, the actions we are taking to optimize cost are clearly helping to offset the effects of an approximately 16% reduction in gold prices this past year.","Comparing 2013 with 2012, we delivered revenue of $8.3 billion, down 16%, due to lower commodity prices. On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $2.8 billion as strong operating performance was offset by $4.4 billion in asset writedowns.","Adjusted net income was nearly $700 million, or $1.40 per share, down from $3.71 per share in 2012, primarily due to the reduced gold price. ","Cash flow from operations was very strong, at $1.6 billion for the year. This is clear evidence of the outstanding efforts of our operators to manage cost in the current challenging price environment.","Turning to slide 15, we see the impact of asset impairments and NRV adjustments on our net income for the year. I would like to walk you through the reconciliation to adjusted net income. ","Full year earnings per share on a GAAP basis was a loss of $4.94. We experienced a total of $6.88, net of taxes and minority interest, for impairments and revaluations. These writedowns were largely attributable to reductions in assumed long term gold prices. ","For accounting impairment testing at year-end, we assumed $1,300 per ounce of gold and $3 per pound of copper. $5.01 net of tax is related to impairments of property, plant, mine development, and other long term assets, primarily at Boddington in Australia and Long Canyon in Nevada.","The same factors that impacted these operating assets also affected our deferred tax assets. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance with an impact of $1.07 to earnings per share. When calculating adjusted net income, we also exclude the gain on sale of assets as that is nonoperating as well.","Thus we ended the year with adjusted net income of $1.40 per share. We also had a charge of $1.11 related to the revaluation of stockpiles and ore on leach pads. Approximately $0.61 of this is attributable to gold, and the remaining $0.50 to copper. Adjusted net income would have been $2.51 if you add the stockpile revaluations to it as well. ","Moving on to slide 16, the fourth quarter was a particularly strong quarter for us, with all-in sustaining costs of $1,032 per ounce, down 14% over the prior year. Our gold CAS was $755 per ounce for the quarter, and it fell at the low end of our 2013 full year outlook. And I do want to point out that these figures include the impacts of the NRV adjustments I mentioned. ","Realized copper pricing for the fourth quarter of $2.99 was impacted by higher than expected treatment and refining charges at Boddington. Copper CAS of $4.02 was negatively impacted by the NRV adjustments.","For the 2013 fiscal year, all-in sustaining costs were down 6%, or approximately $73 per ounce, from 2012. Realized gold and copper price for the fiscal year were down 16% and 14% respectively, and CAS was up 12% and 89% respectively. The all-in sustaining costs in CAS numbers include the noncash impacts of NRV adjustments, which make it challenging to see the significant improvement in our costs. ","Turning to slide 17, we can see the impact of the NRVs on our reported costs applicable to sales more clearly. On a consolidated basis, you can see that our CAS for 2013 excluding NRV adjustments was in line with 2012 at $675, demonstrating that our commitment to reducing costs and implementing efficiency improvements is taking hold.","Total NRV adjustments included in CAS were $347 million for the quarter and $958 million for the full year. Across our regions, we saw CAS either improving significantly or holding the line over the prior year. When Chris discusses operating results later, he will provide additional detail on how our regions delivered on our objectives and he will focus on CAS excluding the NRV adjustments.","Now moving on to slide 18, as Gary mentioned, our capital allocation strategy is focused on three points. First, improving financial flexibility, second, enhancing our portfolio to focus on those assets with the greatest risk-reward profile, and third, returning cash to our shareholders. ","First, improving our financial flexibility remains a top priority for us, and we\u2019ll continue to take actions to ensure we improve our balance sheet position. The outstanding focus in 2013 shows in the numbers and the actions. We ended 2013 with $1.6 billion in cash and no borrowings on our $3 billion revolving credit facility. ","Even more important, we generated $1.6 billion in cash from continuing operations for the year, which includes $400 million in the fourth quarter, the quarter with the lowest realized gold price of the year. ","You may remember that three months ago I was very pleased to report our first quarter of positive free cash flow in two years. Well, I\u2019m even more pleased to report that we did it again in the fourth quarter. With two straight quarters of positive free cash flow behind us, we clearly have turned things around.","We\u2019re cognizant of our debt requirements as well, and are focused on reducing debt and taking other actions to improve our financial flexibility. Yesterday we announced our success in obtaining commitments for a term loan of $575 million, which I\u2019ll discuss shortly. ","We also look to rationalize nonstrategic assets and interest as a source of additional financial flexibility. In 2013, we divested approximately $600 million in noncore assets. All of these actions have served to significantly improve our financial flexibility. ","The second element of our capital allocation policy is to take actions that will enhance our portfolio. Our assets remain the lifeblood of our company, and we will continue to leverage the inherent strength of our current portfolio and exploration strategy to drive production over the long term. And I\u2019d like to note that while we believe it\u2019s prudent as a company to evaluate acquisition prospects, we would only do so if such opportunities are accretive to cash flow in the near term. ","Thirdly, while we remain focused on strengthening our balance sheet and looking at ways to enhance our portfolio, we are also committed to returning capital to shareholders through our gold-linked dividend that has been adjusted to the current realities of the industry. And I\u2019ll review our stated policy in a minute. ","Moving on to slide 19, as Gary mentioned earlier, one of our core priorities is maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. Over the last two days, we announced two actions that clearly support that priority. ","First, we secured commitments from a group of lenders for a five-year term loan of $575 million. The proceeds are expected to be used to repay the $575 million of convertible debt maturing in July 2014. The term loan is structured to facilitate early repayment without penalty from free cash flow, as we expect to delever over the five-year period. This slide illustrates our revised maturities after considering the term loan, which positions us very well. ","We have also instituted a revised dividend policy that allows for sustainable returns to our shareholders, without compromising our ability to invest organically or maintain financial flexibility. We will continue to pay a dividend at a gold price above $1,200 per ounce, with significant leverage for shareholders as the price of gold rises. You can see the increasing dividend on this slide.","In summary, we are taking the right steps to strengthen our balance sheet through additional asset divestitures, a reduction in the dividend payout schedule, and most importantly, maintaining an ongoing focus on generating cash through continued cost and efficiency improvements.","And I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Chris, who will provide you with a regional update for 2013 compared with 2012.","Chris Robison","Thanks, Laurie, and good morning to everyone. Moving on to slide 21, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance our regions delivered in 2013. In Nevada, fourth quarter gold production increased 12% from the prior year quarter, due to higher tons and grade at Mill 6, higher grade at the Juniper Mill, higher grades at Phoenix, as well as higher leach production at Carlin North Area and Emigrant. This were partially offset by lower royalties paid due to lower metal prices and higher inventory builds. ","Full year production over the prior year was flat and, exclusive of impairments, CAS was $642 per ounce for the year. The regions delivered exceptionally well on the all-in sustaining cost front, reducing all-in costs by 8% to $964 per ounce.","On the project side, we\u2019re very pleased the Phoenix copper leach project achieved commercial production on time and on budget in the fourth quarter. This project will add 9,000 tons of copper production each year.","Moving south, on slide 22, Yanacocha\u2019s fourth quarter attributable gold production decreased 21% from the prior year quarter, mainly due to planned lower gold leach production resulting from lower grades. Yanacocha\u2019s CAS per ounce increased 35% from the prior year quarter, due to leach pad writedowns and lower production. Excluding impairments, South America\u2019s CAS for the year was $546 per ounce, slightly up from $505 per ounce prior year.","South America production is down 20% over prior year, as planned. However, despite reductions in production, the region achieved a 6% improvement over prior year all-in sustaining costs coming in at $1,032 per ounce.","Turning to slide 23, our Africa region delivered strong production and a reduction of 19% in all-in sustaining costs over 2012 and the successful startup of the Akyem operation. Ahafo fourth quarter attributable gold production increased 32% from the prior year quarter, due to higher ore grade and throughput. Ahafo\u2019s CAS per ounce decreased 27% from the prior year quarter due to lower milling costs and higher production.","Production from the region increased 25% over prior year, due to the successful ramp up at Akyem in the fourth quarter, delivering 129,000 ounces, well above our expectations of approximately 50,000 to 100,000 ounces for the year. I commend the team for delivering this project on time and under budget. ","Moving to Indonesia, on slide 24, Indonesia production was down and costs up over prior year, as expected, as the phase six stripping campaign remains underway. We anticipate reaching the higher grade phase six ore in Q4 of this year.","Fourth quarter attributable gold and copper production decreased 14% and increased 38% respectively from the prior year quarter due to lower ore grade from gold and higher ore grade from copper, as well as higher copper metal recovery. CAS increased 51% per ounce, and 57% per pound, respectively, due to stockpile writedowns. Excluding stockpile writedowns, gold CAS was $927 per ounce for the full year. ","Finally, we move to Australia and New Zealand, on slide 25. I recently visited all of our Australian and New Zealand operations, and was extremely pleased with their efforts to reduce cost and improve productivity. This is particularly evident in our Tanami and Waihi operations. Fourth quarter attributable gold production increased 5% from the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher ore grades and higher throughput. ","Other Australia and New Zealand CAS per ounce decreased 23% from the prior year quarter due to lower operating costs and higher production at Tanami and KCGM. Full year gold production for the region is up 7% and all-in sustaining costs are down 2% over prior year, due to improved operating efficiencies at Tanami and Waihi.","I will now turn the call back to Gary to discuss our outlook and the optionality our portfolio offers.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you, Chris. If you could turn to slide 27, Newmont delivered in 2013, and we are committed to meeting or exceeding the targets we are presenting for 2014 through 2016. We expect gold production to rise to between 4.8 million and 5.2 million ounces in 2015 and 2016. This would represent an increase of about 5% compared to 2014.","In North America, production is expected to rise from 1.6 million to 1.9 million ounces, mostly due to better grades and lower stripping ratios at Carlin and Twin Creeks, which represent an additional 300,000 ounces. We will also benefit from new production of between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces per year, starting in late 2015, as the turf vent shaft is completed.","We expect Australia and New Zealand production to remain stable at 1.7 million ounces, with portfolio improvements offsetting lower production at [unintelligible] as that mine matures. ","In Africa, production is also expected to remain stable in the 700,000 to 800,000 ounce range. Akyem will deliver 400,000 ounces per year, and Ahafo will rebase to between 300,000 and 400,000 ounces in 2015 due to increased stripping as we execute laybacks.","In South America, we are evaluating options to boost production through laybacks and optimizing our approach to developing the Conga project. In the meantime, we are projecting that production will decline by about 200,000 ounces as our deposit matures. ","Finally, we are projecting gold production increases of about 200,000 ounces per year in Indonesia as we reach primary ore at the end of 2014. This represents about 6% to 7% of our overall gold production in 2015 and 2016.","Turning to our copper production outlook on slide 28, we also expect Batu Hijau copper production to grow by 50% to more than 100,000 tons in 2015. Copper production at Phoenix and Boddington is expected to remain stable at about 50,000 tons annually over this same period.","Turning to our cost outlook, on slide 29, we surpassed our cost and efficiency improvement targets in 2013, and will continue our strong trajectory over the next three years. Our outlook is for all-in sustaining cost reductions of approximately $600 million to $700 million, which will offset the effects of inflation and rising input costs and keep our cost per ounce stable.","We are confident that we can accomplish this, but we\u2019re not entirely satisfied, and we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to boost productivity and efficiency. Let\u2019s turn to slide 30 to look at what this means for gold costs. ","Gold CAS is expected to remain stable from 2014 through 2016, with improvements offsetting a 3% compound annual inflation rate. About two-thirds of our savings are expected to come from operating cost and efficiency improvements, while the remaining third will come from better throughput and recovery.","North American CAS is expected to benefit from higher grades, lower stripping ratios, and improved plant performance. In South America, CAS will benefit from processing plant and facility consolidation that will help offset the impact of mining older deposits. In Africa, we will optimize the mine fleet and achieve other productivity improvements that will help offset the impact of lower grades and higher stripping ratios at Ahafo. ","In Australia and New Zealand, efficiency improvements will focus on increasing mill throughput and improving maintenance and dispatch practices. Finally, the ramp up of phase six mining is expected to significantly improve both gold and copper CAS at Batu Hijau in 2015 and 2016. ","Taking a brief look at our copper costs, as we turn to slide 31, our overall cost to produce copper will rise with production volume increases. More importantly, our unit costs will be reduced by more than 60% from 2014 to 2016, primarily due to efficiencies of scale in Indonesia. Our outlook also calls for reduced sustaining capital expenditures in the years ahead.","Turning to slide 31, as I clarified earlier, we are taking a reasoned approach to these reductions. After three decades in the mining industry, I can promise you that drastically cutting sustaining capital to make the numbers look good in the short term ends up costing significantly more in the long term. ","This page shows the total capital spend, which is predominantly sustaining capital. Development spending is down this year, as we\u2019ve completed Akyem and Phoenix, copper leach, and reduced our spend at Conga. Our sustaining capital spend is expected to increase by about $250 million in 2014 compared to 2013, due to increased spend on deferred stripping at Carlin and Twin Creeks, mining development at Tanami, and tailings expansions at Gold Quarry and [unintelligible]. ","That said, our total capital spend will decline by 30% from 2014 to 2016, exclusive of further investment opportunities. We\u2019ve had great success in improving project economics, at Merian in particular, and we will reconsider our development spend for the right opportunity. The ultimate outcome of cost and capital discipline is a healthy business. Let\u2019s move on to the final slide and look at where we\u2019re taking Newmont in the medium term.","Our vision for Newmont is to lead the gold sector in creating value for shareholders. As we have demonstrated over the last half hour, we are on track to maximize value in the short term and to capture the benefits of economic recovery and demand growth in the longer term. We have set a clear path to improve the business by building a portfolio of longer life, lower cost assets, by delivering steady production, by making cost and capital discipline part of our DNA, by maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and financial flexibility, and by replenishing our growth pipeline.","Thank you for your time, and I\u2019d be happy to field your questions now. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Patrick Chidley from HSBC, your line is open.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC ","Just a question on your projects, really. Maybe you could supply us with a little bit more detail and information on what the plan is at Merian, for example. Is it going to be a leach or a mill? What kind of strip ratio should we assume given the grade that you\u2019ve got there?","Gary Goldberg","Merian\u2019s actually near surface deposit. It would be run through the typical leach process after milling. And we\u2019re expecting between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces a year production over the first five years. The ore in the first part, that sits up near the surface, is very soft ore, so you actually get very good throughput. And coupled with the grade that you saw, that\u2019s what helps to provide really good front end production over the first couple of years. ","Capital on that, in terms of what would be remaining to spend, and as we\u2019ve announced here, we now own 100% of that project, the government has the potential to take up 25% under its rights with our mineral agreement, but the capital overall, remaining to spend, is between $800 million and $1 billion. ","Patrick Chidley - HSBC ","And if you made the decision in the second quarter or coming up soon, then would you start construction this year? Is that how it is, or is there more work to be done?","Gary Goldberg ","Yes, that would be what we\u2019d be doing. It would take about two years from the time we make that decision to the time we get to first production. And I\u2019ve been down there, and obviously had a chance to visit our competitors\u2019 operation at [unintelligible] to take a look and very similar sorts of conditions early on in the mine life.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC ","And I noticed you added [unintelligible], 9.5 million ounces, to the resource statement, for the first time. Is that something that\u2019s developing into more of a project for you now?","Gary Goldberg ","At this stage, we\u2019ve added it into resource, but we\u2019re not doing a whole lot of work on it, given some of the other things going on in Indonesia. ","Operator","Brian Yu, your line is open.","Brian Yu - Citigroup ","My question is more on Yanacocha. It seems like from your guidance there\u2019s a nice 1% bump in production for 2015. If you could give us maybe a little bit more detail on what\u2019s happening there?","Gary Goldberg ","Actually, Yanacocha, we expect fairly steady production this year and next year, and then see the decline in 2016, our attributable share down about 100,000 ounces, 200,000 overall. The team there\u2019s been looking at different ways to be able to extend the mine life as we continue to progress the work on our [water first] strategy at Conga.","Brian Yu - Citigroup ","I might have misread it. It seems like your cash costs are dropping nicely in 2015. If it\u2019s not production, can you elaborate on what\u2019s driving the cost reductions?","Gary Goldberg ","I might ask Chris Robison to comment briefly.","Chris Robison","While we\u2019ve already seen some good cost reductions in the Yanacocha, we continue to focus there through our Full Potential project, and we see significantly more costs coming out in \u201915. So that would be the main driver. Ounces are pretty flat.","Brian Yu - Citigroup ","But then it comes back out? In 2016, costs are getting pretty close to a thousand?","Gary Goldberg ","In 2016, because we\u2019re not giving production out beyond \u201916 with this, we\u2019ve got some stripping we\u2019re doing in \u201916 to do laybacks to provide production out in \u201917 and \u201918. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Bridges from JPMorgan. ","John Bridges - JPMorgan ","I know you can\u2019t say much in Indonesia, but what\u2019s changed in the last three months? And then there was a story yesterday that some operators there had got export permits, but I understand that you didn\u2019t get any. What should we take from that?","Gary Goldberg ","I think a couple of things. In terms of what\u2019s changed in January, January 11, the government did come out and extend basically what they had in place for a potential export ban from 2014 to 2017. I met last month at the World Economic Forum with a couple of different ministers of Indonesia to talk about the situation and talk about potential paths to a solution. ","I think what I\u2019ve seen happen here in the last day or two, you saw, I think it was five different groups that were granted export license. One of those is the Gresik smelter, which we ship copper to, and that provides for them to be able to ship basically the refinery slimes or the anode slimes out to get processed and operate. The rest you saw were, I think, pretty much just nickel and nickel matte producers that received their licenses. ","We\u2019ve not achieved that, and neither has our other competitor there in Indonesia, as we look at the situation. We are in discussions about what we might do that fits within their overall objectives and what we need, and what we believe we\u2019re supported in with our contract to work.","I think the other thing you\u2019ve got going on, we\u2019ve moved, over the last three months, closer to the parliamentary elections, which are in April, and then a presidential election in September. And what you do have going on is the sort of things that happen around an election that can cause some uncertainty. So we\u2019re working through that at the same time.","John Bridges - JPMorgan ","And actually, they\u2019re quite cash-strapped in that country, I believe.","Gary Goldberg ","I\u2019m with you in terms of I believe having our operations running and contributing to the local economies where we operate, for employees, the regional government, national government, is an important part and contribution to Indonesia.","John Bridges - JPMorgan ","And then you said that you weren\u2019t going to issue equity to pay down debt, but you\u2019ve got the Merian project, you\u2019ve got a decision on Long Canyon coming up. I\u2019m just wondering the extent to which you feel you can finance that growth capital within the production and cash flow profile you just detailed. ","Gary Goldberg ","As you look at where prices are today in particular, we\u2019re very comfortable that Merian at this stage can be done within the cash flows we\u2019re forecasting over the next year or two. And we\u2019ll have to assess Long Canyon. And that\u2019s why what we haven\u2019t done is built in any of these projects until they go through and get board approval. But part of that process will be looking at what our capital is that\u2019s available. And in the meantime, as we\u2019ve emphasized, we\u2019re still looking at other assets that may not be core, and that we might be able to sell.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Graf from Cowen.","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company ","Just circling back to Indonesia, how much of Batu Hijau\u2019s planned 2014 production can be placed at Gresik?","Gary Goldberg ","At this stage, if our current plans are in place, it would be about half of our production for the year. We\u2019re looking at some contingency plans that would allow us to actually take our production back through the year, if it was needed, and then Gresik could handle up to 90% of our production.","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company ","And then as a follow up to that, it seems to me that the 2009 mining law and the current export tax and ban violates your contract of work, and if nothing is going to happen politically to change that in the near term, and you guys go to international arbitration, how will that unfold?","Gary Goldberg ","At this stage, we\u2019re trying to avoid taking it to arbitration and have the discussions that we believe we can have with the government to resolve the situation. So if we\u2019re required to go to arbitration, which I\u2019d put kind of towards the last resort from my standpoint, then we go through a process of filing and actually we\u2019re then into a longer process several months to a year to work ourselves through an arbitration process, but at the same time, continuing to work to resolve the issue. ","But at this stage, that\u2019s not at the forefront of our approach. Our focus is on having discussions with government officials to resolve the issue for the benefit of Indonesia and obviously for the benefit of our employees and our shareholders. ","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company ","And just finally, the Batu Hijau expansion that had been in the works, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s off the table until things are clarified?","Gary Goldberg ","Yeah, what we have at the end of this year, we\u2019d be getting back into primary ore for phase six, and then we\u2019re into that for the next two to three years. The expansion you\u2019re referring to, phase seven, we\u2019d begin stripping for that towards the end of that 2016 timeframe. At this stage, plans to move forward with phase seven are pending resolving this issue.","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company ","I guess I was also referring to the mill expansion, to take total throughput at Batu Hijau to 175,000 tons a day.","Gary Goldberg ","At this stage of the mine life at Batu Hijau, we\u2019re not pursuing a mill expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank ","I was wondering if you could disclose the terms of the recent $575 million bank loan that you obtained, and if you could just contrast that with, perhaps, why you chose to do that instead of a bond.","Laurie Brlas","The terms are very similar to our existing revolver. Very minimal covenant package. An example of the confidence our banks have in us. I think that\u2019s a very positive statement. And really we selected the term loan because of the prepayment without penalty, and the goal to delever over the coming five years. With the bond, we would not have that type of a luxury. So it was for that reason.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank ","And what kind of interest rate are you paying?","Laurie Brlas","LIBOR plus 1.5.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank ","And maybe a second question, just conceptually, you did mention that your intention is to delever. Rough numbers, we\u2019re looking at you guys earning anywhere between $200 and $300 an ounce of free cash flow, just based on the sort of all-in sustaining cost concept. But then your interest expense could be around $300 million to $350 million a year. Just wondering what your projected tax assumptions are in 2014. Do you expect to pay any cash taxes?","Laurie Brlas ","Yeah, we will be paying some cash tax, but it will be less than we paid in 2013.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank ","And then if you made a decision on Merian or any of these other growth projects, would the door be open there to raise equity for those projects, bring in a partner? How would you intend to fund some of those big cash calls if your free cash flow does not support it? Or would you simply just delay the project?","Gary Goldberg ","In the case of Merian, and given where current conditions are, obviously it\u2019s got to be taken forward and receive board approval, but we see Merian as one that we can cover within our current cash flows. As we look out to 2015 and the decisions that we\u2019ll have in front of us there, we\u2019ll have to assess the situation at that stage.","Operator","We do have a question from Garrett Nelson from BB&T Capital Markets. ","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","I\u2019m wondering what the guidance assumes in terms of production from new mines. Are the primary drivers basically higher ore grades at Batu Hijau and in Nevada, in addition to the turf vent shaft production in late 2015?","Gary Goldberg ","I think what we\u2019ve included in here, we don\u2019t have, for instance, the Merian project that I talked about, so that would add production, if we went forward with it in 2016. We don\u2019t have Long Canyon, we don\u2019t have the things I talked about Ahafo, the mill expansion, or the underground. Those are all projects that, once they come forward, we make a decision and would include them. Then we\u2019d include those in the statistics and make the changes to our forecast. ","The only new project or major development project we\u2019ve got going on that\u2019s showing up in the production numbers is the turf vent shaft, which comes online towards the end of 2014. The rest of the swings you see are around primary grade, as I mentioned, at Twin Creeks and Carlin, as that increases in 2015 and then 2016. ","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets ","And then based on these guidance ranges, in current gold prices, it looks like your free cash flow generation could be significant over the next few years. Is your first priority the Merian and Long Canyon projects? Or is it debt paydown? If your intention is deleveraging, perhaps targeting the 2017 or 2019 maturities, are you targeting any specific leverage ratios?","Gary Goldberg ","Lots of questions in there. I think the key, though, comes back to what the priorities are. I think we\u2019ll look at development opportunities that generate free cash flow and look attractive. I think paying down debt does fit in there, and then tying back to our commitment to shareholders to return a portion of our free cash flow back to shareholders, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in our modified gold price linked dividend would be where our priority and targets are.","Garrett Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets ","Do you have any specific leverage ratios in mind?","Laurie Brlas ","We don\u2019t really have a specific leverage ratio in mind. Continuing to work with the rating agencies and focus on the investment grade balance sheet, that\u2019s been our focus, and continuing to manage the debt. And as Gary said, it\u2019s really a balance of all those activities. I wouldn\u2019t suggest we put all of it into debt paydown, but a portion of it would be very good.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Goldberg.","Gary Goldberg ","Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining. There are three points that I\u2019d like you to take away from today\u2019s presentation. We delivered nearly $1 billion in costs and efficiency improvements in 2013, and we have plans in place to deliver another $600 million to $700 million. ","Second, we delivered two projects on time and on budget at Akyem and Phoenix copper leach, and we optimized our exploration and project pipeline. We will only invest in the most prospective development options, such as Merian. ","Third, we\u2019ve taken decisive action to maintain financial flexibility with changes to our dividend policy and we\u2019ll apply strong rigor to our capital allocation process. ","Thank you very much for joining today. "],"15757":["Newmont Mining Corp.

Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Q3 2018 Earnings Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's third quarter 2018 conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team.","Turning to slide 2, before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Jess, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We delivered strong performance for the third quarter and continued to execute our strategy, which includes: delivering superior operational execution by running our mines safely and efficiently; sustaining a global portfolio of long-life assets by advancing profitable expansions and exploration on four continents; and leading in profitability and responsibility.","Before we get into the details of our third quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to recognize Tom Palmer and congratulate him on his promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I've known Tom for almost two decades, and have had the pleasure of working with him since 2014 when I recruited him to join the Newmont team.","More recently, I recommended to our Board of Directors that Tom be promoted to President based on his performance and experience and as the next logical step in his development. Tom and his team has skillfully executed the strategy we established over five years ago which has reflected in our results as we continue building the next generation of profitable mines with the focus on capital discipline and industry leading returns.","Turning back to the third quarter details on slide 4, the first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the third quarter, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $927 per ounce, consistent with our planned back half of the year weighting. We delivered good safety performance and reached our lowest total injury rate for the year, as we continue applying lessons learned across the business. And we also continued to improve cost and efficiency through our Full Potential Program and advancing our three most promising digital initiatives including: Smart Mine, connected worker and advanced process control. These initiatives are critical for us to offset inflation and increasing cost pressures at our operations.","The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the third quarter: in North America, we commissioned the cleaner flotation circuit to complete the CC&V concentrate project; in South America, we placed the first Quecher Main ore on the leach pad in September, and mining continues on schedule; in Australia, we advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study; and in Africa, we started commissioning the Subika Underground project, and are on track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter.","Finally, we've continued to plant seeds for the future by forming an exploration partnership with Evrim Resources for the Cuale project in Mexico and invested in Miranda Gold in order to serve mining projects in Colombia. We remain excited about Colombia's prospective gold districts, and are working with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritic\u00e1 project. This also applies to the security of the people around the project, which does not currently meet our expectations.","The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the third quarter, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we maintained one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with an investment grade credit rating and $6 billion of liquidity. Finally, we were recognized as the Mining Sector Leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for an unprecedented fourth year in a row. This performance starts with running safe operations.","Turning to slide 5, while the third quarter marked our lowest total injury rate for the year, we're not letting up, as there's always more work to be done. We remain focused on driving visible felt leadership by reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors, along with the verification of critical controls to prevent fatal injuries. In order to prevent injuries, our team have recorded over 15,000 verifications to critical controls with a completion rate of 99% year-to-date.","So, previously mentioned, we're honored to be ranked as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index again, highlighting the performance goals we continue to set, including: minimizing our environmental impact and partnering to improve the availability of shared resources like water; demonstrating best practices in Corporate Governance, codes of business conduct, and risk and crisis management; and investing in community infrastructure and skills development, so we can continue to earn the right to operate and grow.","Turning to our cost performance on slide 6, our long-term record shows a steady trajectory of improvement. But, as expected, our costs rise in 2018 as we execute planned stripping campaigns at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington, and Yanacocha. Year-to-date, costs have decreased to $973 per ounce, which is consistent with our second half weighting. And we lowered and narrowed our 2018 AISC outlook to $950 to $990 per ounce, driven by continued outperformance at Boddington, Akyem, and other sites across our portfolio, partially offset by higher costs at Carlin.","Turning to production on slide 7, we produced 1.3 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the third quarter, as we reached higher grades in Africa and South America, and increased processing of CC&V concentrates in Nevada. And earlier this month, we poured our millionth ounce of gold at Merian after just two years of operation.","Due to recent geotechnical events at Carlin, we narrowed our full-year production guidance to between 4.9 million and 5.2 million attributable ounces. Tom will cover this update in more detail later. Overall, we remain on track to achieve our highest production in the fourth quarter on the back of planned higher grades at Leeville, Yanacocha and Ahafo.","Turning to our current projects on slide 8, in the third quarter, we delivered two profitable projects in North America, with Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus. Both of these projects extend mine life and add lower cost production. And we are currently executing four projects that will be completed before the end of 2019. In Africa, we remain on track at Subika Underground, which will add higher grade, lower cost production, and work at the Ahafo Mill expansion has ramped up, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of 2019.","In South America, we're extending oxide production with Quecher Main, and we placed first ore in September. This project serves as a bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. And finally, in Australia, we're making good progress on the Tanami Power project, which will lower costs and emissions and facilitate future growth. These projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20%.","Turning to slide 9, our ability to pursue growth on four continents is a distinct competitive advantage. In North America, we continue to pursue underground expansions at Carlin and are progressing prefeasibility studies for Long Canyon Phase 2. And we begun scoping the Galore Creek prefeasibility studies with Teck Resources.","Finally, we recently partnered with Evrim Resources to advance the exploration of Cuale, a prospective gold project in Mexico. In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha Sulfides and Chaquicocha Oxides projects in Peru. And as I previously mentioned, we are working with Continental Gold to support development of the Buritic\u00e1 project.","We're also pursuing a range of other promising exploration prospects in Colombia, Chile, Suriname and French Guiana where we've recently begun drilling at the Esperance site shown in this picture. In Africa, we're advancing studies of underground deposits at Ahafo and Akyem, and continue to progress the Ahafo North project. And we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we've advanced our second expansion at Tanami, which Tom will touch on further, and continue to explore greenfield targets across the continent.","With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on slide 10 to discuss our third quarter financial results.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary. Turning to slide 11 for the highlights, I'm pleased to report good financial results despite gold price decreasing over 7% compared to the prior-year quarter. This quarter, we delivered revenue of more than $1.7 billion, adjusted net income of $175 million or $0.33 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA of $636 million. Cash from continuing operations was $428 million compared to $489 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower metal prices and unfavorable changes in working capital.","Turning to slide 12 to review our earnings per share in more detail, for the third quarter, we recorded a loss in our GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.31 per diluted share, primarily due to the impairment of long-lived assets at exploration properties and Emigrant in North America. As shown on the slide, these impairments were adjusted for a total of $0.74 per diluted share.","Other adjustments for the quarter included $0.14 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts, and $0.04 related to a change in the fair value of our marketable equity securities and gains on asset and investment sales. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share.","Turning to capital priorities on slide 13, Newmont continues to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector with liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.4 times. And we remain well-positioned to execute on our capital priorities, including: maintaining an investment grade credit profile; investing in the next generation of Newmont operations to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base; and returning cash to shareholders.","Yesterday, we declared a dividend of $0.14 per share for the fourth consecutive quarter. We're on track to return nearly $400 million to shareholders in 2018 through dividends and our share buyback program, which aims to maintain a constant share count. We also continue to support increased financial transparency in the gold sector.","Over the last several months, we have led a working group with the World Gold Council and our peers to provide greater clarity and consistency for all-in sustaining costs reporting. The Council expects to issue an updated AISC guidance note next month with a January 1, 2019 effective date.","For Newmont, the proposed changes are expected to lower our AISC due to the exclusion and reclassification of non-sustaining costs related to activities such as exploration, advanced projects, and R&D. Historically, we've taken a more conservative approach when reporting AISC, and we believe the changes will make our cost basis more comparable to our gold industry peers. We will provide additional details on these changes and reconcile to our past methodology when we issue our 2019 guidance on December 5.","And now, I'll hand it to Tom for a discussion of our operations starting on slide 14.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Nancy. Turning to slide 15, year-to-date, our North American operations have produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs under $1,000 per ounce. For the third quarter, Carlin delivered solid performance, as production increased following the planned Mill 6 maintenance shut in Q2, and we started to see higher grades as expected from our underground mines.","At our surface mines, we continue to actively monitor and manage geotechnical risks. At Silverstar, our work continues to remediate the 2016 slip, and we still plan to access higher-grade ore in the fourth quarter. However, after experiencing further wall movement during the third quarter, we have stepped out to manage this issue. As a consequence, we are targeting a smaller mining footprint in this pit.","In early October, we also experienced a wall slip at our Gold Quarry pit. The detection measures we've put in place identified movement prior to the event, and no one was injured. Mining in this pit is currently suspended, and our teams are working through an assessment of mine plans and next steps to safely restart mining.","As a result of these challenges, we lowered Carlin's 2018 production outlook, and now expect the North America region to produce approximately 1.9 million to 2.1 million ounces. As Gary mentioned, at CC&V, we completed the concentrate project. The cleaner flotation circuit is performing to design and we are ramping up concentrate deliveries to Nevada.","We expect a strong finish to the year, as we continue to draw down stockpiled concentrates and process them through Carlin's Mill 6. Twin Creeks delivered improved costs and grade following the completion of Twin Underground in July. And at Long Canyon, Phase 2 studies continue to advance as to our new mine exploration programs, assessing the next wave of expansion across the region.","Turing to South America on slide 16, as Gary mentioned, earlier this month, after just two years in operation, Merian poured its 1 millionth ounce. I'm tremendously proud of the team for safely achieving this milestone. In the third quarter, Merian delivered solid results through continued mine and mill productivity improvements. We declared the primary crusher ready for intended use in early September. This new crusher will help sustain mill throughput and enable the processing of fresh rock beginning early next year. We also expect productivity at Merian to increase over time with the recent addition of four new haul trucks, combined with the ongoing improvements through our Full Potential Program.","At Yanacocha, we reached higher grade ore in the Tapado Oeste pit, and continue to see the benefits from our optimized mill blending strategy. Quecher Main stripping is ramping up, and we placed first ore on an existing leach pad in September as construction of the new leach pad continues.","Studies at Chaquicocha Oxides continue to advance with drift development to the north and south completed, serving as a platform for the exploration drilling we have underway. The Yanacocha Sulfides, we plan to extend our feasibility study work by a few months to allow us to optimize our tailings storage strategy and complete the associated engineering. We now expect to complete the feasibility study in the first half of 2019 and make a full funds decision in 2020.","Turning to Australia on slide 17, at Tanami, we delivered strong third quarter performance with higher grades and sustained improvements in mill throughput. The Tanami Power project continues on course, construction activities at the power stations are ongoing, and the gas pipeline trenching and welding is progressing ahead of schedule. We expect to deliver this project in the first quarter of 2019. At Boddington, our optimized mill maintenance strategy has helped improve both productivity and costs, and we now expect a lower 2019 all-in sustaining cost of between $880 and $930 per ounce.","Our planned stripping campaign will ramp up through the remainder of this year and continue through 2019. At KCGM, we continue to manage the impact from wall slips early this year. Mining rates have been reduced. However, we continue to mine and process ore from the Super Pit and Mt Charlotte underground supplemented with stockpiled ore.","During the quarter, we finalized the insurance claim of $25 million for our share of lost profits. Considerable work is also underway to assess the longer-term impacts, and we expect to provide more information in early December.","Looking to the future, we recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2 to definitive feasibility study, and anticipate reaching an investment decision in the second half of 2019, followed by a three-year construction period. For an investment of approximately $650 million to $750 million, this project is expected to add an incremental 100,000 ounces of annual production from 2023 through 2027. The project is not included in our current guidance.","Turning to Africa on slide 18, Africa again delivered solid results on the back of higher grades and strong mill performance. At Akyem, continued outperformance allowed us to lower our 2018 all-in sustaining costs for the Africa region to $820 to $860 per ounce. Looking ahead at Ahafo, commissioning is underway on the Subika Underground surface infrastructure and the project continues to progress on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of this year.","The project is expected to add 150,000 to 200,000 ounces of higher grade, low-cost production annually over the next five years. Construction activities at the Ahafo Mill expansion resumed in August, and the team is making good progress on civil works at both the SAG mill and primary crusher.","During the fourth quarter, we expect to complete the installation of the new pebble crusher and CIL tanks. We remain on track to achieve commercial production during the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to advance our regional growth studies focused on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem, as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North.","Now, I'll hand it back to Gary on slide19.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Turning to slide 20, Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and operating model that we need to create value over the long term. We began transforming our business six years ago, and I remain very proud of the team for the work done to set our business up for success over the long term by: optimizing the portfolio through the monetization of non-core assets; advancing profitable growth on all continents adding more than 2 million ounces of gold production at all-in sustaining costs of about $750 per ounce; investing in exploration across the cycle to support a stable production profile with approximately 70% of our production and reserves located in the United States and Australia; and restoring our balance sheet to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our most promising projects and prospects. All of these attributes give us the optionality and the ability to stay disciplined in how we pursue value creation and generate returns for shareholders.","Our portfolio is also differentiated by a robust project pipeline. Turning to slide 21, our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency, and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing margins and reserves. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here: Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill expansion in Ghana; Morrison and the Tanami Power project in Australia; and Quecher Main in Peru.","Two midterm projects that will improve our outlook are: Ahafo North and the recently advanced Tanami Expansion 2, both shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund these projects in the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects shown in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady, long-term production and profitability.","Turning to slide 22, this gives you a feel for our production profile for the next seven years. Annual gold production is forecast to remain at around 5 million attributable ounces, and our share of global mine production is projected to grow over that same time period. This profile includes production from existing operations, as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance.","The green layer shows production from Ahafo North and Tanami Expansion 2, both midterm projects which are not included in our guidance. And the dark blue layer shows Yanacocha Sulfides, a longer-term feasibility project representing further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage.","Putting it all together on slide 23, we delivered strong third quarter performance and are laying the groundwork for an even stronger future. We'll continue to execute our long-term strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer time horizon; invest in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business; and to lead the gold sector in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold.","Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today will come from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning, Gary, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. You've been working on Subika for a long time. So I'm guessing that thing is pre-developed. I'm just wondering if you could surprise us in Q4 with a lot of production coming out of there. When do you expect that ore to start coming out, and what are the constraints on pulling that tonnage at this point?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning, John. I'm going to hand over to Tom to address that question.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning, John. What you're going to see in the fourth quarter is a combination of a couple of things, both associated with Subika. So, we're currently mining in the Subika open pit as well, and we'll move into higher grade ore in the Phase 3 layback at Subika. So you're going to see the contribution of some higher grade ore from Subika open pit coming in our fourth quarter numbers.","Then what happens with Subika Underground? We have been mining from there all year, but as we commission the fans, the ventilation fans and the refrigeration plant, it allows more air into that underground mine and allows us to increase our mining rate. So you'll see some more tonnes coming out of the mine and the better grades you get from Subika. So, in the fourth quarter for Ahafo, combination of two things, both surface and underground, both associated with Subika. They're going to contribute to fourth quarter performance.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Are we sort of talking in the third person here? But we're in the fourth quarter already, so is that equipment in place?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Well, the equipment is absolutely in place. It's got electricity on it, and we're busily working on getting to a point where we'll reach commercial production this quarter.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then perhaps a bigger picture question, with the pit problems in Carlin, the whole industry is facing mature pits. And you've got Subika coming on and the underground projects in Africa, Tanami, and your share of Turquoise Ridge. So, to what extent are you positioned to switch to a bigger underground, less influenced by mature pit configuration over the next few years?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","John, I think when you look at our production today, we're roughly 25% of our productions coming from underground. We expect over the next 10 years to see that number rise quite a bit. And I think we've got some really qualified folks running those underground operations, and really ultimately what will be an all-four regions that we operate in at the end of the day. So, I think we're well positioned to continue to make that switch. As you know, at the end of the day, it's still based on the ore bodies and those characteristics. And I think we're well positioned to address both surface and underground opportunities in the future.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Cool. Okay. Well done, guys. Thanks a lot.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary, Tom and Nancy. Maybe my first question is to the newly appointed President looking at Subika again. I got to say that I was pretty surprised at the underground mining rate which is about 1.5 million tonnes per annum that we saw in the last quarter. Just wondering what your expectation is going forward that seemed quite a bit higher than what I'd previously anticipated.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, David. Tom here. Yes. You're going to see \u2013 our mine sequencing in the third quarter allowed us to get rates pretty similar to what we'll see when we've got the full ventilation on. So, you'll see roughly those rates going forward that you saw in the third quarter. What you are going to see though as we get the air to different parts of the mine is our ability to access higher grade stopes.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. So...","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Similar tonnes, better grade.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","All right. So, I was previously assuming something like 1.2 million tonnes per annum, but you're feeling comfortable at 1.5 million by the sounds of it. So, I'd just make that little tweak.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","I'd keep it in that range...","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Not get too aggressive. Okay. You're talking me down.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. Well done.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Over to Merian, also a higher mining rate than what I'd anticipated as well, and wondering what we should be thinking going forward. Were you just in softer ore there and that helped you out, or how should I be thinking about it?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","We are, you can think about Merian in terms of wet season impact. So as we come into the dry times of the year, which we saw some of it in the third quarter, you will get some higher rates. We are seeing the impact of the four additional trucks coming in. So, you will see some higher mining rates as a result of the additional fleet. But the rate you're seeing in the third quarter is pretty consistent with what you might see going forward. And then, at various times in the Merian mine sequence, we will reach some higher grades, and that's one of our fourth quarter weightings for this year is in the Maraba pit, we will move into some higher grade ore.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. And in the third quarter, there was more mining than processing, so you're adding to the stockpile. Is that part of your strategy? Because previously, you've kind of mined what you milled, are you looking at building a stockpile going forward?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","You will see \u2013 we'll see increased waste movement, and you will see, yeah, us mining more ore and stockpiling it as we keep the mill fed.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Last one, at Phoenix, there was more production than sales. Will we see a catch-up in the fourth quarter? Is it just a matter of timing of shipments?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Exactly right, David. That's timing of concentrate shipments at Phoenix.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much. I'll leave it there.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Gary, Nancy and Tom. Yeah, few questions from me. I just wondered, Tom, if you could go into a little bit more detail on the geotechnical issues at Carlin, maybe step through the timeline on how you're seeing that progressing and when you'll be able to make more decisions going forward on that. That's my first question.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Chris. Maybe (31:10) two pits. So, Silverstar is in the North part of Carlin and Gold Quarry is in the South part, so they're a good 20 miles apart across that Carlin complex. In Silverstar, the work we've done through the third quarter to step out and manage some of the activity we saw through the third quarter, that's all in good shape. We're in ore and we'll be mining there from now until the end of the first quarter, and that really sees the end of the Silverstar pit. And that's the order of about 160,000 ounces to come out of there. So, that's factored into our guidance for the remaining part of this year.","Gold Quarry, the area that slipped, it says \u2013 as I think John said, it is a mature pit and the area that slipped was the \u2013 some alluvial material at the very top of that pit, so a wall that had been sitting for quite some time. So, we've got some work to do to step through and understand the mechanisms for what happened there, and then develop a remediation plan to get back in and accessing ore out of Gold Quarry. A lot of the work in Gold Quarry for the short- to medium-term is actually stripping. For the Carlin complex, Gold Quarry is one of five open pits that we've been mining, multiple underground mines and then multiple stockpile sources.","So, the overall impact to Gold Quarry, put it in perspective, year-to-date Gold Quarry has contributed about 100,000 ounces of Carlin's production. So, there are a number of other things we can do to source ore for the processing plants at Carlin whilst we work through how to best remediate that section of the Gold Quarry pit.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Tom. That's helpful. Just in terms of the overall environment, I think I've asked this question maybe six months or so ago, and just wanted to get an update on it. And maybe it's for you as well, Tom. Just on the consumable side and the general cost environment, how are you seeing that from labor, pressure from diesel, et cetera, just as we head into 2019? Thanks.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","We're certainly seeing some increase in cost from diesel globally which, I think, everyone's experiencing. With some reasonable production coming out of Australia, we do get some offset from the Australian dollar helping in that space. Other consumables, we're monitoring. We are certainly seeing pressure in those. That's where our Full Potential Program comes into play, and we look to offset those escalations with our Full Potential improvements as a minimum.","From a labor perspective, most parts of the world, yeah, we're seeing pretty stable labor costs and attrition rates. Probably in Australia, just starting to see with the market in Western Australia in particular heating up with the iron ore players, a little bit more attrition and an area that we're keeping an eye on that may put some pressure on labor rates into next year. So, that's a particular area we're keeping an eye on.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay, thanks, Tom. My last one is just for Nancy. In terms of the cash balance, it's still above $3 billion, can you just give us an update there on the ability to reduce the cash rates? I know that there's obviously some restrictions in South America, et cetera, but maybe you can just talk through where you see that trending over time.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. We think about our cash balance as a real benefit and a differentiator for the company. And as we continue to generate free cash flow, we will use those dollars, both generative and what's on the balance sheet, to fund our business going forward, that will mean investment in the business through CapEx. We've enhanced our exploration dollar spend this year, and we're also providing more cash back to shareholders in the form of the share buyback to cover dilution and enhance dividends.","So, all of those kinds of things will allow us to continue to invest in our business and also give us a lot of flexibility for opportunistic M&A \u00e0 la things like CC&V done in a lower gold price environment. So, we want to continue to have those levers. The other piece, as of today, we have that flexibility to pay back our notes that come due in both 2019 and 2022. And we'll use some of the cash proceeds for those repayments, but another lever we can pull. So, we enjoy that cash to have ultimate financial flexibility for the company as we pave the way for the next few decades.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color. Yeah. I mean, I was referring specifically to the size of the cash balances. So, obviously, it's quite a large number for the company just in terms of looking at the net debt I guess overall. I was more meaning around South American and the restrictions on getting some of the cash out and some of the more details around the specifics on the cash balance.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Oh, sure. Yeah. We have cash in jurisdictions where we want to continue to invest in our business. So, for example, in South America, as you think about the capital requirements coming up over the next few years for projects like sulfides and some other projects, we want to maintain cash balances in-country. So, we don't have any restrictions today in terms of repatriating cash to the U.S., but have chosen very purposefully to keep the cash in certain jurisdictions. So, we're comfortable with that balance, and we're comfortable with the complement of the countries in which it's allocated today.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Nancy. That's all from me. Thanks.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Yes. Good morning, everybody. I just have a technical question...","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning, Tanya.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Morning, Gary. Of course, can't leave you without a technical question, so coming back to Gold Quarry, I just wanted to have an idea of the \u2013 without seeing a photo or looking at the size of the slide, how much ore are we impacting?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Tanya, it's Tom.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Yeah, Tom. Sorry. Yeah.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sorry, Tanya. Did you have something else you wanted to add?","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Yeah. I just wanted to know the slide, the pit wall failure at Gold Quarry. How much ore have we impacted with that slide?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","The impact has been \u2013 in terms of an area that we were planning to mine on the opposite side of the pit, that's not affected by the slide. It's more about what we need to do to remediate the slide before we can access that ore on the opposite side of the pit. So, that's part of the remediation step.","Then that area that's slipped would be part of a future layback where we'd actually tape that material down to get to ore into a future layback on that side of the mine. So, it's not sitting on top of ore per se. It's more about \u2013 in some instances, it's helped in terms of laying itself back, but we need to think about how we safely get through and remediate that area.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. So, nothing's been sterilized or anything like that. It's just a matter of having to remove it, and as you said, it's helped you a little bit on the layback that would have otherwise had to be laid back.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's right. Picture the Carlin formation or alluvial material at the very top of mine flowing down into the pit, and it's a matter of cleaning that up now.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. Do you know how many tonnes are sitting in the bottom of the pit of this slide just size wise, so...","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","It's sort of a couple of million tonnes of the \u2013 sped from the \u2013 imagine, it's a mature mine, so it's a deep pit. So, imagine, that's spread over quite a distance.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay, so it's a couple million tonnes. Okay. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tanya.","Operator","Our next question will come from Lucas Pipes of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. Most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to follow up a little bit about the comments regarding the succession planning from the prepared remarks. Gary, if you could maybe elaborate on your thoughts on that, and obviously he's had a great tenure and just wanted to hear kind of what some more background on sharing that language. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure thing, Lucas. I think as were in the prepared remarks, I've known Tom for almost two decades and brought him in. We gave him the challenge of Indonesia right off the bat. So he's been fire tested in terms of some pretty challenging situations as we went through export permit issues and ultimately a divestment there. Tom then moved over to the APAC region and ran that quite well, and the operations there, we ended up divesting Waihi during his term there and also divesting Batu Hijau. And two-and-a-half years ago, Tom was promoted into the COO role. And Tom and his team have really been core to delivering our strategy over the last two-and-a-half years and working with the board on plans for succession and plans for his development, it made sense this stage to take this next step and naming him as President and COO.","Lucas N. Pipes - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Got it. Got it. Okay. Well, that's helpful color. I appreciate that, and best of luck.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Lucas.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, everybody. Gary, as you look out to 2019, I'm sure we're going to go into a lot more details in December. But given where gold prices are and have come down over the past several months and looking at your several opportunities for investment for the pipeline, are you concerned about \u2013 what timing and capital outflows and how you want to develop these projects especially given your capacity to develop with your internal team as we look forward to these like medium-term opportunities before we move on to a larger, a more expansive ones like that in Latin America?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Michael, it's a great question, and I think \u2013 we always have gotten the question, can you move these things faster, and I've stressed the point that we want to make sure we do the study work along the way. We happened to have four projects coming along in the later part of 2019, first part of 2020. In some ways, that gives us leverage depending on where gold price is. Keep in mind, we do our plans at a base of $1,200 an ounce, and we have our hurdle rates. And at this stage, these all look to be good projects that would add value to our shareholders to move forward. But your point in regards to \u2013 at least they're going on in different regions, so that's a positive. In terms of how we manage them, when we bring them on, that's one of the things we do consider as we make the decisions to move forward. And we, of course, would want to move forward with the best projects first. But I think we sit in a really good spot and we have flexibility depending on where gold prices go. And as you heard from Nancy, we do have the ability to fund those projects going forward.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And that's very helpful, Gary. And following up on \u2013 you had some prepared remarks about Colombia. Maybe you can share with us \u2013 since the issues occurred last month, what Newmont and Continental have done and any changes or thought process relative to getting things a little bit more stable down there before you start moving much more quicker into that relationship?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think two key areas: one, working with Continental to better understand what happened and what actions need to be taken to make sure people are protected. So, that's at the forefront in terms of working with them.","In regards to our own people that are down there working on exploration at this stage, as we work through with Continental and with our own people down there, we are not doing any active exploration on the ground. We're making sure we work with the local authorities and communities to make sure that before we put people down on the ground that they can be properly protected and work safely down there. So, those are the two key areas we're focused on.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you, Gary.","Gary J.

Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Jess, and thank you, all for joining us this morning. Newmont delivered some strong results in the first quarter of 2018. Our costs and production remain in line with our global guidance, we're building seven profitable projects on four continents, and we advanced the next generation of Newmont mines to the next stage of development. We also generated $644 million in adjusted EBITDA and declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, making it the strongest among the senior gold producers. This performance, however, was overshadowed by a tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion that resulted in six fatalities.","Turning to slide 4. As a background, construction contractors were in the process of pouring concrete for an elevated slab on April 7 when the roof collapsed. Emergency response teams were deployed immediately, but our efforts were not successful. And six men, whose names you see here, lost their lives. Tom and I traveled to Ghana to join our regional leadership team in reaching out to their families, our employees and government and traditional leaders to offer our heartfelt condolences.","We have assembled an expert investigation team and are supporting the government's investigation to understand exactly what happened. Operations in Ghana were temporarily suspended in the wake of the accident so we could review safety standards and conduct risk assessments prior to resuming operations. Both Ahafo and Akyem are now up and running, but certain work on the Ahafo Mill Expansion has been suspended until we and the authorities are satisfied that work can resume safely. This loss has had a profound impact on the entire Newmont family, and it is with great humility and resolve that we renew our commitment to working safely. Nothing is more important.","Turning to more details on the quarter on slide 5, we continue to deliver our strategy, starting with superior operational execution. This includes producing 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $973 per ounce, in line with guidance and continuing to improve cost and productivity through our full potential program. For instance, we're launching our first centralized process control hub in Australia, which allows experts at each site to collaborate on resolving problems and raising performance.","We also continued to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter. We remain on track to complete Northwest Exodus, Twin Creeks Underground and Subika Underground later this year. We also advanced Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides and Long Canyon Phase 2 to the next stage of development study and added Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline. And we progressed our near-mine exploration programs, as well as promising greenfields prospects on four continents.","We delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $644 million, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter, declaring a dividend of $0.14 per share, nearly three times higher than the first quarter of 2017, and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector.","Finally, we met sustainability targets to uphold human rights and lower water use and greenhouse gas emissions. I invite you to read more about our performance in our Sustainability Report, Beyond the Mine, which is posted on our website.","Turning to our cost performance on slide 6. While our track record shows a steady trajectory of improvement, our cost rise temporarily in 2018, as we undertake stripping campaigns at Carlin, Boddington, Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Our profile also reflects increased investment in exploration and projects, in keeping with our focus and creating long-term value. Cost will come back down, as we reach higher grades and bring on new lower cost production at Subika Underground later this year.","Looking at the first quarter of 2018, we remain in line with guidance and we continue to improve cost and efficiency, by enhancing ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and its viability.","Turning to production on slide 7. We're also maintaining a steady production profile. Our outlook reflects productivity gains in mine planning and mill performance, as well as success in bringing new mines and extension into production. We expect to deliver between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in 2018 and we're on track to meet that commitment with 1.2 million attributable ounces of gold produced in the first quarter.","As a reminder, production is weighted to the second half of the year when we'll recoup production from the Silverstar mine at Carlin in Nevada, reach higher grades in South America and Africa and bring the Subika Underground Project online.","Turning to more on our current projects on slide 8. As I mentioned, we remain on track to reach commercial production at the Subika Underground later this year and we've begun to restart construction work at the Ahafo Mill Expansion as we perform detailed risk assessments on the various tasks involved.","In North America, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground remain on track to reach commercial production later this year. We also began shipping concentrates from Cripple Creek & Victor for processing in our Nevada mills in early 2018 and Tom will have more on our results to-date. In South America, Quecher Main is well underway. This project is designed to extend oxide production and bridge to developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits.","Finally, in Australia, we're progressing the Tanami Power project, which will lower cost and emissions and facilitate future growth. These six projects will generate an average internal rate of return above 20% helping to improve our outlook.","Turning to slide 9. Newmont's five-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs, with ongoing investment and profitable growth. We've not changed our global guidance, but Tom will talk about a few regional and site changes during his remarks.","Turning to our longer term growth prospects on slide 10. Our ability to pursue growth on four continents is a distinct competitive advantage and one that builds on our established infrastructure, proven operating and project experience and strong regional relationships. In North America, we've advanced Long Canyon Phase 2 to prefeasibility study and continue to pursue multiple underground expansions at Carlin. We're working with Goldstrike to further explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon.","In South America, we continue to see favorable drilling and process test results in Peru at the Yanacocha Sulfides projects and have included a new project, Chaquicocha Oxides that Tom will review in more detail. We're partnering with Continental Gold to support the safe and efficient development of the high grade Buritic\u00e1 project as well as nearby exploration assets in Colombia. And we're also excited about Esperance, an early-stage exploration property in French Guiana.","In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem and we're working with a local partner, Ezana, to explore greenfields opportunities in Ethiopia. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and advancing greenfields exploration prospects in Western Australia, New South Wales and the Northern Territory.","With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Gary. Turning to slide 12 for first quarter financial highlights. Compared to the prior year quarter, revenue improved 8% to over $1.8 billion, driven by higher realized gold price. Adjusted net income increased 36% to $185 million or $0.35 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA increased 12% to $644 million.","Cash from continuing operations was $266 million, primarily due to higher working capital outflows and increased investment in exploration and advanced projects.","Turning to slide 13 to review our earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.32 per diluted share, up 146% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 loss related to restructuring costs and a $0.02 loss primarily due to valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per diluted share.","Turning to capital priorities on slide 14, we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector with total liquidity of $6 billion and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.4 times. We continue to invest in the next generation of Newmont operations in order to improve mine life and build a stronger reserve base. We also remain focused on returning cash to shareholders. Earlier this week, we declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share, reflecting an increase of $0.09 over the prior year quarter.","Based upon an annualized $0.14 per share quarterly dividend plus the share buyback program executed in the first quarter of this year, we're on track to return more than $350 million to shareholders this year. Looking forward, our balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow allow us to continue executing our strategy.","And now, I'll hand it over to Tom for discussion of our operations starting on slide 15.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Nancy. Turning to Africa on slide 16. Our priority in Ghana is to look after people, starting with those who lost family members in the tragic accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion and extending to our team who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership under very difficult conditions. We're working to understand what went wrong, so that we can make sure it never happens again. Not only at Newmont, but in the broader mining community.","Turning to operational performance. Both Ahafo and Akyem delivered strong results in the first quarter. This is largely due to ongoing mill throughput and recovery improvements, which helped to offset the impacts of harder, lower grade ore at both operations. We were also pleased to reach an agreement, representing fair wages and benefits with the Ghana Mineworkers Union.","The Subika Underground continues on course. We're currently developing our seventh stope and expect to reach commercial production later this year, driving outlook for an even stronger second half. And we approved funding for definitive feasibility studies at Ahafo North, where we are focused on optimizing the project, securing permits and engaging stakeholders. Finally, we continue to advance longer-term development of our underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem.","Turning to North America on slide 17. North America also turned in a solid quarter. At Carlin, work to improve ground control and stope design has allowed us to ramp-up production, with improved development rates and higher grades in our underground mines. We continue to de-weight the Silverstar pit and expect to reach ore later this year. Mill 6 is performing well. We're processing the first shipments of concentrates from Cripple Creek & Victor and seeing higher than expected recoveries. But we expect lower production in the second quarter, as we undertake our annual planned maintenance shutdown on Mill 6.","CC&V's production was impacted by the timing of leach recoveries and the stockpiling of concentrates during the first quarter. But we expect full-year cost to improve, with higher recoverable leach ounces and higher than expected recoveries on concentrates sent to Nevada. At Phoenix, mine plans and sequencing have been reconfigured to improve value. We are focused on gold zones in 2018 and we'll shift to higher grade copper zones beginning in 2020.","Finally, we have revised guidance for Twin Creeks to reflect slightly lower production and higher costs for 2018. This is result of exiting a layback earlier than expected last year to manage geotechnical issues and shifting focus to our next stripping campaign at the Mega pit. The team is actively pursuing opportunities to offset these impacts and our North America production outlook remains unchanged.","Turning to growth. We remain on track to reach commercial production at the Twin Creeks Underground and Northwest Exodus later this year and Long Canyon Phase 2 studies have advanced to the prefeasibility stage, paving the way for potential production by 2024.","We also recently executed a purchase agreement with Agnico Eagle for the joint venture interest in land near Long Canyon, securing future growth optionality and potential resource extension into this highly prospective district.","Turning to South America on slide 18. Merian continues to deliver solid mill performance with ongoing improvements in mine productivity And we commenced mining in the Maraba pit, providing high grade separate light ore (00:15:16) to the mill. Our primary crusher installation is advancing on course and will be completed in the second half of the year as we reach fresh rock.","Medium-term expansions at Sabajo and longer-term exploration at Amazonia is also underway in Suriname. Production at Yanacocha is slightly delayed due to the timing of leach recoveries, but we do not expect any changes to production guidance. However, Yanacocha's cost guidance is improving on the back of optimized or blending strategies at the gold mill. Stripping has begun at Quecher Main and we remain on track for first production in early 2019. And we continue to see promising drill results at Chaquicocha where we are dividing two underground oxide deposits to the south and north of the existing pit.","You can see this shown in yellow at the bottom of the slide. This successful exploration work has given us the confidence to add Chaquicocha Oxides to our project pipeline at the prefeasibility stage and we expect to convert some of this oxide deposit to resource at the end of 2018. As Gary mentioned earlier, we advanced Yanacocha Sulfides to feasibility study in the first quarter, and we continue our work to optimize our technical approach.","Turning to Australia on slide 19. At Boddington, we optimized our mill maintenance strategy to reduce the total number of plant shuts per year from four to three. This change delayed some production in the first quarter, but we expect to recover those ounces over the course of the year. Mine sequencing at Boddington resulted in higher copper and lower gold production in Q1. We expect to reach high gold grades during the second quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year targets.","We're also re-sequencing our mine plant at KCGM as we take a considered approach to remediating the west wall slip in the Fimiston pit. As a consequence, we have reduced our production outlook for 2018 by 40,000 ounces. Despite this short-term setback, we're well positioned to access high-grade ores over the longer term. At Tanami, we've launched a refresh of our full potential program with a focus on increasing mine productivity to match already strong mill performance and we continue to progress our second Tanami expansion.","We've started raise bore drilling a pilot hole to guide our approach to sinking a shaft that will allow us to maximize value from the deeper ore body. We expect to reach a funding decision on the project in the second half of 2019 and for construction to take around two years.","And finally, we have begun construction on the Tanami Power Project which involves building a pipeline and two power stations that will allow us to switch from diesel fuel to natural gas as our main energy source. We expect the project to be commissioned during the first half of 2019 and to lower energy costs and emissions by 20%.","Looking to the remainder of 2018 on slide 20, our global cost production and capital outlook for 2018 remains unchanged, despite lowering our cost guidance in North America and South America and reducing our production guidance at Twin Creeks and KCGM. We continue to expect back-half weighted results in 2018, reflecting higher stripping and maintenance shutdowns in the first half and higher grades and new lower cost production from the Subika Underground in the second half. And we expect to achieve our highest production and lowest costs in the fourth quarter. So we're on course to meet our commitments in 2018, but we will continue to challenge ourselves and learn lessons to improve safety, costs and productivity at our operations and projects.","With that, I'll hand it back to Gary on slide 21.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Turning to slide 22. Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and the resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund high-return projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond. Our portfolio is also differentiated by our near-mine growth prospects.","Turning to slide 23, our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency and it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves. The newest addition to our pipeline is Chaquicocha Oxides, which Tom presented earlier. Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here. Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada, Morrison and the Tanami Power Project in Australia, the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana, and Quecher Main in Peru. A mid-term project that will improve our outlook is Ahafo North, shown here in green. We expect to reach a decision to fund this project in the second half of 2019. Finally, we continue to invest in progressing our longer-term projects, shown here in dark blue. This pipeline lays the foundation for steady long-term production and profitability.","Turning to slide 24. Here's a look at our production profile over the next seven years. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces. And our share of global mine production is projected to grow from 4.4% in 2015 to 5% by 2024. This profile includes production from existing operations, as well as sustaining and current projects that are included in our guidance.","The green layer shows production from our mid-term Ahafo North project which is not included in our guidance and the dark blue layer shows two longer-term feasibility projects, Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides, which represent further upside. Overall, Newmont's stable asset base and robust project pipeline represent a distinct competitive advantage as does our leading reserve profile.","Turning you to slide 25. One of the practices that distinguishes Newmont is that we never stopped investing in exploration across the price cycle. And in 2017, that investment paid-off as we replaced reserves depletion at a constant gold price and increased resources. The value and risk profile of our reserve base also compares favorably to the gold sector average. We offer 128 ounces per thousand shares and an operating reserve life of about 12 years and more than 70% of our reserves are based in the U.S. and Australia.","Another distinction is that our mine grade is about the same as our reserve grade. Our focus on quality reserves has helped sustain top quartile total shareholder return since 2014. Putting it all together, we continue to deliver strong results and position the business to generate more value over a longer time horizon.","Summing it all up on slide 26, our performance in the first quarter was strong but indelibly marked by the six fatalities our team suffered at Ahafo. The best thing we can do for our team and our shareholders is to learn from that loss and recommit to our strategy, which is to deliver steady gold production safely and at competitive costs over a longer term time horizon, continue to invest in the next generation of mines, leaders and technology across our portfolio and stay at the head of the pack in terms of the value we create and the standards we uphold.","Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Gary and team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is probably for Nancy. Just in terms of the working capital moves during that quarter, do we think about those as a one-off for this year or is there something to look for in the other quarters?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. Great question and just a reminder, we don't give guidance on free cash flow. I would think of it more of timing differences and a couple of drivers for that is really timing of shipments created a bit of an AR build at both Merian and Phoenix. There was also a bit of build on leach pads and con inventory as we prepare to ship from CC&V over to Nevada. And then, in this particular quarter, there was a bit of timing around accounts payable just mostly at North America and Boddington. So I would consider those to be just a bit of anomalies for this particular quarter.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Nancy. And just maybe this one's for Tom, in terms of the maintenance during 2Q, you talked a bit about Mill 6 at CC&V. Can you just run through the other operations and the impact on the production in 2Q specifically that you've allowed for as a result of that? Thanks.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Chris. The major maintenance work, it's our annual \u2013 every second quarter we do the annual shutdown on Mill 6. So that's typically a three-week shutdown and so that's the major maintenance impact on production at across the business in the second quarter. Now, Mill 6 is now taking concentrates from CC&V. So again, you'll see the impact in terms of stockpiling some of those concentrates and then they'll come through the mill as we come out of that shutdown. So just commenced that shutdown and it runs for about three weeks.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Tom. And then, just in terms of the overall M&A environment at the moment, has anything changed there? You've obviously got a great pipeline of organic opportunities. But are you looking at anything on the other divestment or investment side outside of the organic opportunities?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","No. I think, Chris in terms of \u2013 as you put it, we've got a great pipeline of organic projects and we really remain focused on those. We do continue to scan the horizon and look at things and kick the tires as we've done over the years. CC&V having been the only one that we actioned over the last five years. We'll continue to look but really see the production and the potential of the projects we have and from the exploration work that we do. And we're focusing on some of these earlier stage areas like I mentioned in my comments in South America, in Africa, in North America, and in Australia. And we keep focusing on those.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Thanks, Gary. Then the last one for me is just the talk about Northern Territory and the royalty hike. Have you got any thoughts on that? I think it's reasonably small but just some comments if you don't mind.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think I'll hand that one over to Nancy. I think, I mean, it's been talk primarily in Western Australia that has been where the focus has been. We've been through a couple of rounds. Our key focus has been on getting the facts out in terms of what the true impacts are on royalties and working with other gold producers in that region. In regards to Northern Territory, I'll hand over to Nancy where that's at.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. We have been watching that one very carefully. There have been movements in that area from a legislative perspective and our tax department and our gov-rel people, as well as our operations people have been very closely tied to that. We understand generally the thinking around a royalty-based profit or an ad valorem-based, either of which we've evaluated and have considered the impacts on our plan. So as we build our business plan into 2019, we'll figure out the best way to incorporate those and that will also be represented in our guidance that we gave later this year. We don't expect significant changes, but we are certainly watching that and will reflect our guidance as appropriate.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's it for me. Thanks for all the answers.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary and team. Thank you very much for the update. My first question, maybe it's for Tom, if you don't mind. Chaquicocha, what's required to get that into production from what you can see now?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, David. So I don't know if you can still see slide 18 in your deck. But as we have drifted -- we drifted in underneath that pit exploration drifts to understand and define the sulfides deposit. But the exploration drifts we sized as production drifts. So we have that capacity there.","So now, as we'd identified and defined that oxide deposit, those exploration drifts will enable us to further define those. And then we'll have \u2013 as through the exploration drift (00:29:30) to that mine infrastructure and ready them up to develop the stopes and mine that ore. So exploration drifts provides some of that infrastructure. The upsides then provide a further bridge from Quecher Main to the sulfides. That ore is mill grade, so it can process through our current mill at Yanacocha. And the work we do to bring it on will actually provide synergies in terms of infrastructure for underground sulfides at the Chaquicocha.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","So having a look at slide 18, you're referring there to the blobs called South Oxide, I presume. So it's hard to tell where it's sitting relative to the pit, but it's accessible only by underground, you wouldn't be able to lay-back the pit?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","We certainly looked at those options, but the one we're taking a pre-feas is to access those through underground mining, through the exploration drifts you can't see in that picture that are sitting in underneath that deposit. And then, the little blobs you see on the north side is where we're drifting out to further explore those. So we're pretty excited about what that might present over the coming months as well.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Just a higher level question here. Looking at your development CapEx guidance for the year, it's around about $600 million. Your run rate for the first quarter was well below that. Is there either, A, a big catch-up for the balance of the year or is there a risk of some of that CapEx sliding into 2019? And is there any implication of that lower spend in the first quarter on the delivery of the various projects that we see in the pipeline.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I'll let Tom cover that.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, David. The run rate is predominantly driven by our spend on Tanami Power. So you'll see that as we've got pipe being delivered, we're into the right season now in the Northern Territory. We'll have \u2013 I think it's five work fronts sinking that pipe. You'll see that's been increased as we start to construct both the pipeline and the power stations at Tanami.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. And back to Nancy, Chris had asked about the working cap and thank you for the answer. But just so that I understand it, can we expect an unwind of some of that $350 million incurred this quarter through the balance of the year?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. Some of that will begin to unwind for sure.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Right.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Again, we don't give guidance on free cash flow, so it's kind of hard to give you a view as to exactly how that will unwind. But we'll try to provide some transparency to that as the year goes on.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","Yes. Good morning, everybody. I've got a few questions, probably for Tom, on the technical side. Tom, the Morrison decision on the timing there, I thought we were supposed get an update with that in Q1. What's going on with Morrison?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tanya. So Morrison, we're scheduled to start that lay-back in the fourth quarter. We had talked previously about approving it in the first quarter, but we made a decision to combine the final permits for Morrison, with some other permits associated with the road out to the tailings facility into a single application. That's now with the government and being processed and we'd expect to see that permit come through probably in the third quarter, in line with starting that lay-back on schedule in the fourth quarter.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","Okay. Okay. Thank you. So, it's just being put into another permit and moving forward. It's still on the same timeline.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's correct. That's correct.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","And then, maybe just looking \u2013 and I appreciate and sorry to hear about the fatalities of the miners in Ghana and obviously number one focus is safety and making sure that everything is in line to reopen safely. Can you just let us know what exactly is being done at the Ahafo Mill Expansion and at what point, if we're down for a while, do we start slipping in the schedule?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Tanya. So our focus over the last two weeks, as I talked about is really making sure that we're providing support to the families impacted by the tragic accident and ensuring that our teams are getting the support they need to ensure that they are focused on doing the work safely.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","Yeah, of course.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","In terms of the mill expansion itself, the status of it, this accident happened in around the civil construction and we're about 70% through that work for the project and very much moving into the structural, mechanical piping phase of the project. So that's the status of the project.","We're reasonably well-advanced and if you recall commercial production's in the second half of next year. So we're going through a process, as we look to ramp up, of inductions, refreshers and doing robust risk assessments on all the work fronts we have across that project as we bring it up to speed. And then, we'll assess what impact that ultimately has on the timetable. But into the structural, mechanical piping stage of the project and second half of next year for commercial production.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","And is there any point at which if we're down and of course, safety is number one in making sure that mine can come up safely. Is there a point in time that if we are not up and running, let's say, by Q3 or Q4 of this year that we slipped. I just don't know the timeline in term of slippage.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tanya. So the Ahafo surface mines and the existing mill at Ahafo were all back up and running 24 to 48 hours after the accident. The Subika Underground was up and running in the similar timeframe. So the Ahafo operation is running as per normal. So this is really then the extension to the mill. And we're working \u2013 as I say, we're working through that process. As Gary said in his talk we're actually working through those restart activities and risk assessments now. We're not anticipating any change to our guidance as we work through this process.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","Okay. And then, maybe my last question and you mentioned that we have the roaster down for maintenance for three weeks in Q2. Is it safe to assume that Q2 operationally may be just a bit slightly weaker than Q1, because of the downtime at the roaster and then, obviously, picking up into Q3 with a strong operational quarter for Q4? Is that how you see the year panning out?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think that's pretty reasonable, Tanya. It's certainly going to see it pretty flat through the second quarter, yet cost will be up because of the maintenance work. You'll start to see Q3 come up a bit. But certainly going to be Q4, as we get into the \u2013 we actually get the Subika Underground starts to ramp up, but you will be into the Silverstar or into higher grades at Merian.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","Okay. And then, what Nancy said, the unwinding of the working capital adjustment will help with the free cash flow generation. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","(00:37:13).","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tanya.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carey MacRury of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Hi, good morning.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning.","Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","You've moved Long Canyon Phase 2 into the prefeasibility stage. I'm just wondering at a high-level, can you talk about what you're targeting there in terms of production level and potential mine life?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I'll hand over to Tom. Usually, we don't get into the big details at this stage until it moves a little further along, but I'll have Tom cover where we stand with that.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks. Thanks, Gary and Carey. As Gary said, we're still in the fairly early stages of this study. Just moving into pre-feas and the project is really about extension of the open pit moving into underground and moving below the water table. So a key part of the pre-feasibility study work is working with the various state and national agencies to advance our water models and do the field work associated with understanding the impact of de-watering. So it's really at that stage as we work through probably, that work over this year and into next year. If that all proceeded well, you'd be looking at starting, stripping in 2021 and moving through to 2024 and your first production would be after 2024 and we're looking to line it up as we come out of the current Phase 1 that that would then be a seamless transition into Phase 2.","Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","So is it more about maintaining Phase 1 production levels or is production expected to go up?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","At that stage, I'd be saying it's probably more maintaining the current levels. But we're still \u2013 it's early stages in the pre-feas. We've got a fair bit of work to do on understanding that whole water balance.","Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Okay. And then, secondly on Ahafo North, you've completed the pre-feas on that. Just a similar question, is there any details you can share on that?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. So really as we move into definitive feasibility, it's really about now optimizing on that project as we move forward for full funding. We're looking at around an annual production of 250,000 ounces out of a standalone mine. It's about 30 kilometers northeast of the existing operations. We've got about 3.3 million ounces of reserves and around 1 million ounces of resource. We're looking at a 13-year mine life and investment in the range of $750 million. And we're working towards a decision in the second half of next year and around about a three-year development schedule.","Carey MacRury - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for any closing remarks.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you all for joining our call this morning and I appreciate the questions. Newmont had some solid first quarter results. We produced 1.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $973 per ounce in line with guidance. We advanced profitable projects and exploration projects on four continents and we increased our dividend while maintaining a strong balance sheet. But we also experienced a terrible loss. Please join me in keeping the families of our fallen colleagues in your prayers and in renewing your commitment to work safely above all else. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect the line."],"15609":["Newmont Mining Corp.

All participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. And please note that the event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Meredith H. Bandy - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide 2, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found at our website at newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us on the call. Newmont delivered an exceptional quarter. Tom, Nancy and I look forward to presenting our teams' work, to overcome challenging conditions at the beginning of the year and improve our outlook for the remainder of 2017, launch another profitable project and invest in targeted gold prospects and create value through improved revenues, EBITDA and dividends.","Turning to more details on slide 4. Quarter-on-quarter, we improved our underlying business by continuing to reduce workplace injuries, maintaining leading sustainability practices, lowering all-in sustaining costs 3% to $884 per ounce, and increasing gold production 13% to 1.4 million ounces.","During the second quarter, we strengthened our portfolio by funding the Twin Underground project in Nevada, a profitable expansion of a well-known resource, progressing expansions at Northwest Exodus, Tanami and Ahafo, investing in Continental Gold's portfolio of high grade prospects in Colombia, and signing exploration agreements in Canada, Australia and French Guiana.","Steady performance and portfolio improvements give us the means to create long-term value for shareholders. During the second quarter, we delivered nearly $700 million in EBITDA, a 16% increase from the prior year quarter; a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.6 times, making ours one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector; our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow; and a 200% increase in our dividend declared for the second quarter. Value creation starts at the mine phase.","Turning to slide 5, Newmont's mines continue to be among the safest in the world. In the second quarter, we brought our total injury rate down to the lowest level we've achieved in two years. While we're proud of this performance, our overall approach to safety is to remain humble. And we continue to learn from mistakes and strengthen our controls. A safer operation is a more efficient operation and ultimately more sustainable.","The photo you see in this slide shows the ultra-fine grind mill we installed at KCGM about two years ago. The mill replaced a roaster and virtually eliminated stack emissions at KCGM. This environmental improvement was achieved while the team also delivered a 14% improvement in throughput, something that Tom will cover in his remarks. Before I move on, I also want to acknowledge the KCGM team for reaching 4 million hours without a loss time injury during the quarter and for donating their safety bonus to people in need in their community.","Turning to our cost performance on slide 6, in the second quarter, we delivered all-in sustaining costs of $884 an ounce on the back of higher production, lower capital and ongoing full potential savings. This brings our gold all-in sustaining costs to $892 per ounce for the first half of 2017 and our cost reductions to 24% since 2012.","Nearly two-thirds of these reductions are the result of our ongoing Full Potential program, which rests on continuing to improve our technical fundamentals and replicate best practices, prioritizing technology investments based on their value and viability and developing the leadership, talent and culture we need to sustain operational excellence.","Turning to slide 7. We increased attributable gold production to 1.4 million ounces, a 13% improvement over the prior year quarter. Contributing factors included higher grades, mill throughput and recovery at Akyem, higher mill grades and new leach production at Cripple Creek & Victor, favorable grades and ore blending at Twin Creeks and continued strong performance at Long Canyon and Boddington. We've improved our 2017 cost production and capital outlook on the back of this performance, which I'll cover shortly. Strong operating performance gives us the means to invest in growth.","Turning to our most recent investment on slide 8. We recently funded the Twin Underground mine, which lies below into the North of the Twin Creek's Vista pit. This is a profitable expansion that is expected to add on average between 30,000 ounces and 40,000 ounces of annual gold production in the first five years, at an all-in sustaining cost of between $650 and $750 per ounce.","Capital costs of between $45 million and $55 million are higher than the prior estimates due to increased mine size and mining rates. The larger mine improves project value and the internal rate of return is expected to be about 20% at a $1,200 gold price.","The mine will supply high grade sulfide ore, averaging 6.5 grams of gold per tonne, to the Twin Creek's autoclaves, improving ore blending options and increasing processing life. The mine will also create a platform to explore and potentially extend the deposit which is open along strike and at depth.","Turning to investments in new districts on slide 9. In May, we announced an agreement to acquire a 19.9% stake in Continental Gold for $109 million. This investment supports development of the high grade Buritic\u00e1 gold project and gives us exposure to Continental's other exploration properties in Colombia.","Buritic\u00e1 includes two major vein systems that are open along strike and at depth with declared gold reserves of 3.7 million ounces at grades of more than 8 grams per tonne. The project is permitted and construction is expected to begin later this year with commercial production in 2020. And over the past month, we've implemented our joint sustainability, technical and exploration committees with the Continental team.","In March, we announced an agreement with Goldstrike Resources to earn up to 80% equity in the Plateau property, through exploration investment. Plateau is a newly-discovered gold system in the Yukon territory. Since closing the transaction, Goldstrike has staked additional claims, increasing the total property to more than 570 square kilometers.","And an airborne geophysical survey has been completed to support structural geology mapping. We are also pursuing exploration prospects in Australia at (8:04) and in French Guiana at Saint-Pierre. These investments strengthen our long-term growth pipeline and leverage our world-class exploration capabilities.","Turning to slide 10 for more detail on our guidance. We're updating our 2017 outlook to reflect strong operational performance and sustainable cost and efficiency improvements. Attributable gold production guidance increases by 70,000 ounces to between 5.0 million and 5.4 million ounces, reflecting improved performance in North America and Africa.","All-in sustaining cost guidance improves by $45 per ounce to between $900 and $950 per ounce, reflecting improved performance in North America, Africa and Australia. And we're lowering our total capital outlook by $35 million to between $890 million and $990 million, inclusive of our new investments.","Exploration and advanced projects guidance of between $325 million and $375 million remains the same, and spending is expected to be back half weighted, peaking in the third quarter. Of this amount, 60% is allocated to exploration, focusing mainly on brownfield prospects. The remaining 40% is allocated to advanced projects, primarily early-stage studies for Long Canyon Phase 2, Yanacocha sulfides, Tanami Expansion 2 and Ahafo North. As a reminder, we do not include projects in our outlook, until we have reached a decision to fund them.","With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy for financial results on slide 11.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Gary. I'm pleased to report another positive quarter with improved earnings and a strengthened balance sheet. Turning to slide 12 for the financial highlights. Revenue improved 12% to $1.9 billion, primarily due to higher sales volumes in North America and South America.","Adjusted net income increased 59% to $248 million or $0.46 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA improved to nearly $700 million. We also generated more than $500 million in operating cash flow and nearly $350 million of free cash flow. Cash from continuing operations declined 21% versus the prior year quarter on timing of working capital changes. In particular, we had a large cash tax payment in Australia this quarter versus a U.S. cash tax refund this time last year, and a bill and accounts receivable, which is expected to reverse out next quarter. Free cash flow also declined 10%, as higher sales volumes and lower CapEx were offset by working capital changes.","I'll turn to slide 13 to review adjustments to net income. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations were $0.36 per share. Primary adjustments included a $0.03 non-cash gain related to the exchange of a JV interest for equity in Shore Gold, a $0.01 loss related to costs associated with the acquisition of Boddington in 2009, and $0.12 related to certain tax items. Because our foreign tax rates are greater than the U.S. rates, we continue to build up our foreign tax credit carry forward. Given the nature of this asset, we carry a full valuation. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.46 per share.","Turning to capital priorities on slide 14. Operating and portfolio improvement support our capital priorities, which are to fund profitable growth, return cash to our shareholders, and maintain an industry leading balance sheet.","We continue to self-fund our most profitable projects in order to expand margins, extend mine life and improve reserve quality. We're also returning more cash to shareholders. Last week, we announced that our second quarter dividend will increase to $0.075 per share, up significantly from the prior year quarter. We extended our $3 billion corporate revolver by two years to May 2022. And as anticipated, we fully repaid $575 million of convertible notes with cash on-hand last week, further reducing debt and simplifying our capital structure.","With the free cash flow we generated during the quarter and the July debt repayment, our total liquidity is about $5.5 billion. We also reduced net debt to $1.5 billion bringing our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to just 0.6 times.","With that, I'll hand this call over to Tom Palmer to cover operational highlights starting on slide 15.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Nancy. Newmont operations delivered a strong first half, and we're positioned to continue that trajectory in the second. In North America our teams are delivering solid results and advancing profitable expansions. In South America, we expect a stronger second half as our operations dry up, and we're making steady progress on growth prospects.","Australia was offsetting adverse weather impacts from earlier this year, while setting new records for mill productivity. And the region remains on track to commission the Tanami expansion in the coming weeks. We're also outperforming in Africa, primarily as a result of mill throughput and recovery improvements, and the Ahafo expansion projects are well underway. Finally, with Dean Gehring's arrival in Peru in early June, our regional leaders are in place and hitting their stride.","Turning to more details on slide 16. North American operations have more than offset the impact of a slip in Carlin Silverstar mine late last year, primarily through mill and leach pad performance at Cripple Creek & Victor, optimized mine plans at Carlin, and higher throughput at Twin Creeks. As a result, we've improved both our original cost and production outlook for 2017. Highlights include, at Carlin, we completed our annual plant maintenance shutdown at Mill 6 ahead of schedule and under budget. We also completed geotechnical studies to guide safe reentry at Silverstar, where production represents upside beginning in 2018. Ground control rehabilitation at Leeville is largely finished as well.","At Cripple Creek & Victor, production is up 15% versus prior year quarter on the back of new leach production, mill grades and ongoing full potential improvements. Long Canyon continues to ramp up and operate smoothly, and at Twin Creeks outperformance is largely due to optimized ore blends and lower displacement by Turquoise Ridge ore.","Looking forward, vent fans are up and running at Northwest Exodus, a mine which has been designed to support autonomous equipment. As Gary mentioned, the Twin Underground project is underway, and we'll start to mine this higher grade ore later in the year, with commercial production forecast at mid-2018. Finally, we continue to advance our Long Canyon Phase 2 studies.","Moving to South America on slide 17. As I mentioned, our South American operations are recovering from adverse weather in the first quarter. At Yanacocha, dilution from extreme rainfall impacted leach pad recoveries. Productivity is improving and we're expecting a stronger second half. At Merian, the team is focusing its Full Potential program on mine improvements to match above nameplate mill performance. Initiatives to optimize expenses, grade control, payloads and haul routes are all underway, and we're on track to complete our primary crusher installation by the end of 2018 when we expect to reach fresh rock in the mine.","Looking to the future, our team at Suriname is making steady progress towards securing permits, consulting stakeholders and advancing drilling to develop the nearby Sabajo deposit. In Peru, we expect to reach a decision to develop the Quecher Main oxide project in the second half of the year. This project would sustain around 200,000 ounces of consolidated annual production from 2020 through 2025 and is not included in current guidance.","Finally, work to optimize the Yanacocha sulfides project is going well. We continue to see good results from exploration drilling in the Chaquicocha decline. We started a second exploration drift and our autoclave pilot tests are going well. We'll have an update for you later this year. This project could come online in the early 2020s and extend profitable production for more than 15 years.","Turning to Australia on slide 18. Our Full Potential program was piloted in Australia in 2013 and continues to deliver outstanding results. All three Australian operations are now mill constrained, making debottlenecking a priority. As you can see from these graphs, we have made solid gains in mill throughput over the last four years.","Boddington has offset the impacts of 100-year storm event in February and is now ahead of schedule, primarily by reaching new recovery and throughput records for three of the last six months. Whilst higher stripping will reduce production by about 10% as we further develop the next lay back, performance in the first half has been strong enough to support improving guidance for the operation and the region as a whole.","Tanami remains on track to meet 2017 guidance, despite a one month shutdown in the first quarter caused by record rainfall flooding all supply routes. The team has begun commissioning activities in the mill and we expect the Tanami expansion to reach commercial production in the coming weeks.","KCGM has offset the impact of a slip in the west wall of the Fimiston Pit earlier this year and remains on track to meet 2017 guidance. Remediation is underway and we expect to complete that work in 2018. We'll reach a decision to proceed with the Morrison layback at KCGM in the first quarter of 2018, to accommodate additional metallurgical testing.","Turning to Africa on slide 19. Africa performed strongly in the first half of 2017, primarily due to mill throughput and recovery improvements delivered through the Full Potential program. As a result, we have lowered our cost outlook and raised our production outlook for the remainder of the year. We've mined first ore at Subika Underground and produced first gold in June. And the mill expansion workforce has been mobilized and civil works for the primary crusher are well underway.","Looking ahead, we continue to advance our regional growth studies, which center on developing underground resources at Ahafo and Akyem as well as Ahafo North. Ahafo North is located approximately 30 kilometers north of our existing operations and encompasses 15 deposits along a 12 kilometer strike length. Before I turn back to Gary, I want to touch briefly on how we assess and invest in technology to support continued value delivery through our Full Potential program.","Turing to slide 20. I'll start by confirming that we rely on technology in every aspect of our business, to map and mine ore-bodies, operate process plants, protect our people, and stay in touch with our stakeholders. And we'll continue to harness technology and pursue targeted innovation and R&D where it adds value.","Our approach to investing in new technology is the same as our approach to all investments, grounded in technical and financial discipline. Benchmarking shows that no one company has all the answers, so we are taking a measured approach, that includes conducting digital assessments to prioritize solutions based on their value and viability, working with leading technology companies, including GE, Cisco, Caterpillar, IBM and Infosys, advancing game-changing technologies to improve performance across the entire mine life cycle, and developing the underlying systems and change management programs that are necessary for both successful and importantly sustainable implementation.","We recently completed a digital assessment at Twin Creeks to prioritize opportunities to deliver additional value. Outcomes of this assessment fall into three broad categories. Enablers that improve efficiency and safety, such as radiofrequency IDs for our team and digital field tools that provide real-time operational and production data, point solutions such as B-TAG tire monitors that support payload monitoring and management, as well as ore blend management, and ore control optimization solutions.","All these solutions feature minimal disruption and high payback. For example, payload monitoring has delivered more than $17 million in annual productivity improvements since it was targeted as part of our Full Potential program in 2014. And, finally strategic opportunities, that include fleet automation, advance process control, predictive analytics and centralized operation centers.","During my time at Rio Tinto Iron Ore, I led the implementation of the industry's first fully autonomous open pit mine, and was a member of the leadership team for the centralized Pilbara operations center in Perth. We'll have a good understanding of the change management required to implement these opportunities.","Realizing the full potential of digital solutions also requires quality data and a sharp focus on business drivers and values. One leading technology company told us that the quality and organization of our data enable them to compress their predictive analytics work from 12 weeks into 4.","Finally, we are leveraging and improving technologies such as virtual reality to improve understanding of our ore bodies and to optimize our drilling and mine plants. We believe that taking a measured approach supported by repeatable, scalable process and robust change management is critical to maximizing return on our technology and innovation investments.","With that, I'll turn it back to Gary on slide 21.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Turning now to slide 22. Our portfolio is anchored in four regions, where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. Improved margins at our newest mines are helping to offset stripping campaigns at our more mature assets, and we continue to fund high margin projects to sustain future production. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond.","Turning to our most recent projects on slide 23. We've developed a strong track record of delivering profitable projects, when most miners were delaying their capital spend. Over the past three years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on time and 20% below budget. We delivered the investment case at Cripple Creek & Victor while completing an expansion. Over the course of the next year, we'll complete expansions at Northwest Exodus and Tanami that add profitable production and service platforms for further exploration.","And in 2017, we've announced decisions to fund three more expansion projects that will improve profitability and extend mine life at Ahafo and Twin Creeks. Taken together, these eight projects will add annual gold production of about 1.3 million ounces at all-in sustaining costs below $750 per ounce for their first five years and generate internal rates of return above 20%.","Turning to our project pipeline on slide 24. Newmont's project pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. This gives us the flexibility to maintain production levels while growing margins and mine life. The projects that are included in our outlook are the current and sustaining projects you see here: Tanami Expansion and Morrison in Australia; Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada; and the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana.","The midterm projects that will improve our cost and production outlook are shown in green. Quecher Main in Peru and Ahafo North in Ghana. Finally, we continue to invest in advancing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue.","Turning to our long-term production profile on slide 25. As you can see, Newmont has a stable long-term asset base with considerable upside from its industry leading project pipeline. Our gold production profile is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces for the foreseeable future, and we continue to advance our mid-term and long-term projects to sustain profitable production in the outer years. We've provided a seven-year view here in keeping with our focus on long-term value creation. And we believe this outlook differentiates us from almost all of our competitors.","Our work to develop a portfolio of lower cost, longer life assets is paying off, and we'll continue this trajectory by taking a fit-for-purpose approach to developing our projects, weighing multiple options to reduce risk and improve return, delivering projects safely on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget, and continuing to invest in early stage and exploration opportunities. Our focus on long-term value creation shows up in our leading reserve profile.","Turning into slide 26. Over the last 16 years, we've added more than 123 million ounces to our reserve base by the drill bit at a cost of just $24 per ounce. And half the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our industry-leading reserve profile includes 129 ounces per 1,000 shares and operating reserve life of almost 12 years. And as I mentioned, more than 70% of our reserves located in the United States and Australia. We've a proven track record of converting about 80% of our resources into reserves, and this year we plan to invest more than $200 million in our exploration program to build on that success.","Summing it all up on slide 27. Four years ago, we launched a new strategic direction and a new era of productivity, performance and growth at Newmont. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our proven strategy to improve the underlying business, we will reinforce our culture of prioritizing value over volume, build in our track record of continuous cost and efficiency improvement, and maintain a world-class asset portfolio where we have the relationships and stability needed to deliver leading results. To strengthen our portfolio, we'll continue to grow margins, reserves, and resources, sustain a robust project pipeline and leverage our exploration expertise and proprietary technologies to develop the next generation of profitable mines.","Finally to create superior shareholder value, we will continue to exercise discipline in all our investments, maintain our industry-leading balance sheet, and uphold our longstanding track record of paying dividends. Thank you for your time. I'd like to now turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And the first questioner today is going to be John Bridges with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with the question.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Gary, everybody. Congratulations on the results. Just wondered, you're still forecasting a $55 oil price for the year. I just wondered what benchmark should we look at to see if you could be bringing that number down in the second half, and especially considering some hedges that may runoff, just as a first question.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. I think just a couple of things. We do hedge a certain proportion of our Nevada diesel production, and that's on a rolling. It goes out about 18 months, because beyond that you start to see the cost go up a bit. So there is some slight hedging, that's more just to manage some of the volatility and smooth things out, but we would focus primarily when we look at our forecast at WTI, and what the rest of the world says. I wouldn't profess to be experts in the oil price, but we think that that provides a little bit of a degree of conservatism where we're at today in oil market.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, that's nice. I don't think there were many experts left in the oil business. And it's good listening to Tom to hear somebody has actually been involved in introducing all these digital cleverness into the mining industry. I just wonder, Tom, if you could talk a little bit about the opportunities you see after your Australian experience in introducing these innovations into Nevada, in particular, and the potential to create more reserves from resources by hopefully lowering costs.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, John. I think the important thing is making sure that just because something worked in iron ore in the Pilbara in that context doesn't necessarily mean it works elsewhere. So I think it's a better understanding of your business context and each of our four regions have different context from each other. But if a pickup in North America, where we've got a number of mines close together, the opportunity around looking at centralizing some of the asset health work, centralizing some of the truck dispatch work, enables us to identify opportunities, where, for instance, if I think about asset health, we look at component life.","And if we have got a consistency in the component life of some key pieces of equipment on our 793 haul truck, then we can be making some decisions about asset strategy that's going to deliver value, maybe keep those components in service for longer or identify where they are failing before they fail and change them out in a controlled manner. And it's doing those sorts of things by looking at those operations at a whole and having some form of central monitoring center that is going to help a place like Nevada reduce their operating costs, and therefore, as you're saying, be able to bring more reserve into the system.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. I look forward to hearing more about that in the future. Thank you.","Operator","And the next questioner today is going to be Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to, Gary, ask you, it's been almost, I think, next week two years since you closed the Cripple Creek transaction. Maybe you can reflect on what you expected and what has come about in that two-year period? And along those lines, and given your 20% returns on what you've provided here in your discussion this morning, which are very positive, is there a sense there's going to be some scarcity value out in the marketplace to find such opportunities to invest at such returns at the current gold prices in your view?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Michael. When we acquired Cripple Creek & Victor, we targeted about a 10% improvement in mine productivity and improvement in costs. And we're seeing that and more. I think, as Tom pointed out, just sharing between folks in the region some of the things going on, operating cost wise, some of our supply chain contracts or things like cyanide and tires have brought benefits that we hadn't even built into some of that 10% cost improvement.","We've carried through and completed the expansion projects at both the mill and the leach. And the leach, in particular, has gone quite well. The mill, we had a few bumps along the way, as we worked through some of the challenges that we inherited there right at the transition, because as you'd recall, the mill was just in ramp-up, so there might be a lesson there as you look at things. But in terms of scarcity of resources, clearly we acquired it at a time when AngloGold needed cash and we were in a good position in a still tough market condition to be able to take the opportunity and bring it into our portfolio.","One of the items we're looking at now that we didn't build into any of the cost and efficiency improvements is the ability to take the concentrate from Cripple Creek & Victor over to Nevada, either to the roaster at Carlin or to the autoclaves at Twin Creeks to both improve and enhance recovery and bring it forward, but also reduce the overall cost for the North American portfolio. That's an option that AngloGold Ashanti wouldn't have had to consider at the time. So it's one that we're continuing to pursue.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Excellent. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And our next questioner today is going to be Chris Terry with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Couple questions for me. Just on Quecher Main, we know the decision is due soon. Can you just provide a bit of timing on whether that's the start of the second half or back towards the end of the year? And what are the key variables and considerations that are left at this stage?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think you probably look for it more in the latter half of this second half, in terms of us getting through the engineering and taking it through the approval process that's needed, which also includes permits, but all that's moving along on schedule right now.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And the other question I had just in terms of the balance sheet, it's obviously in great shape. And you said the dividend policy going out, which is somewhat fixed at this stage. Thinking about other uses for that cash, if we consider a gold price environment that's relatively in the similar band to what we've had, how are you ranking things there? Obviously, you've got several projects that you're continuing to progress, but aside of just paying down debt, anything else that you can point towards on the use of cash?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","No. Thanks, Chris. And similar to what we did last year, we went through our business plan process. We look out the next five years to 10 years at our cash needs both for projects, sustaining capital, what we see on the horizon for investment in exploration and some of the earlier stage projects that we've talked about. And then we modified \u2013 as we did at the end of last year, we modified our gold price-linked dividend.","We'll be doing the same as we go through our planned process this year. So we'll be bringing the plan forward for review with the board in October, looking out once again 5 to 10 years and reassessing our approach to the dividend at that stage. So from a debt standpoint, over the last several years, we've done a good job and put the balance sheet on a strong footing. We don't have another tranche of debt due now till 2019, and so we sit in a good spot that way. So we're really looking at what are the investments back in the business and what can we do to further enhance the dividend going forward. So those will be the things we'll look at when we bring the plan to the board in October.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Gary.","Operator","And our next questioner today is going to be David Haughton with CIBC. Please go ahead.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary, Nancy, and Tom. Thank you very much for the update and very strong results there. Just got a question on to Quecher Main, if I could. You're spending $300 million roundabout. Can you just explain what most of that money would be put to? Is it through pit development laybacks, stripping and pad construction, or do you need fleet? What are the things that would be involved in the CapEx number?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think you hit the nail on the head there, David. Most of it's going to be for stripping and extending the pit there and development as we go forward. And remember that number is a 100% number, that you are talking of, not our share.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","And as far as the operating parameters, what kind of stacking rate would you anticipate and the grade and the kind of strip you'd be thinking of?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","David, it's Tom Palmer here. It's pretty consistent with what \u2013 it's the last of the Yanacocha oxide. So the pit will be mined at similar rates to what you're seeing today in Yanacocha, and what you've seen historically in Yanacocha.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think the other piece, and it's encouraging as we continue to look at developing the sulfide deposit, we're doing additional exploration around the fringes and seeing some interesting things in terms of drill results from the Chaquicocha pit with ore that could be, once again as you pointed out, process through some of our existing facilities either through the mill or on the leach pad. So, early days yet with that, but encouraged by those drill results.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Well, it also gives you time to assess not only other oxide areas that you've not been able to get to before and also to think about the sulfides. I presume you're thinking about that as well.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Exactly.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Just over to Twin Creeks, Underground coming into commercial production later this year. I saw that you had about 50,000 tonnes, imperial tonnes of underground material going through in the last quarter. What kind of thinking do you have for this new decline? Is there is scope for that underground to increase beyond your current incremental 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 ounces per annum. Can you just outline some of the parameters there, and your thinking where it could go?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. I think just to start I was just over there a couple of weeks ago and visited Underground, so I got a good chance to see how the development is going. We had done quite a bit of development work already, which is why you'll see first production coming out here later this half. We're really open, as I said, along striking and at depth, and we'll continue. They've got a pretty efficient way that they look to mine this, but as we continue to get and develop further access for exploration, I suspect we'll see probably not an increase in production, so much as increase in life, at least to begin with, is where I would expect to see the change. But we'll just have to assess that, as we get more access for further drilling to firm up the resource into reserve.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","And the last one, I know that you've got a pretty good pipeline that you've demonstrated of your inorganic opportunities, but you are extending beyond that now. The investment in Continental and also into Guiana's (40:13) elsewhere, is a bit of a change, I guess, for you? What is it, for instance, at Buritic\u00e1 that you are seeing that attracts you to Colombia?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think it's the exploration potential, some great resources there. It's a country that's been going through some positive change in terms of the direction it's heading. As you know, we have to be looking out 10 years to 20 years when we make investment decisions, and we figured this is a good way to test the water, so to speak, to go into better understand the country, and we believe that the Continental team has done a good job with the Buritic\u00e1 project and also we like the prospects. There are other exploration prospects there, and further afield in Colombia. So -- but a measured approach to understand the risk and go in where we see worthwhile reward and grade makes a big difference in terms of this resource.","Operator","And our next questioner today is going to be Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Yes. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations on some good results. This one is to ask Tom a little bit about how some of the key mines are looking into the second half of the year, and one of them was just Merian. I'm just wondering Tom, are we expected to see production ramp up in Q3 and then a strong Q4 is that still the plan?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's right, Tanya. So, we're \u2013 as I talked in the call and doing a fair bit of work on improving mine productivity and working our way through the wet season which is coming towards its end in Suriname. So we're expecting to see pretty consistent third quarter and probably then stepping up in the fourth quarter for stronger second half.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. And then just on Boddington, I'm sorry, it was faded in and out a little bit for me. Did you mention that, we are going to be increasing the strip as we go into the second half of the year? I think Q4 we were into a higher strip, so costs at that operation should go up, and with production to be down about 10% in the second half. Is that what I heard?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's exactly right, Tanya. So we're moving, and this is southern layback at the Boddington mine. So we start moving to the series end of that strip, so exactly you should say that's about how to play them.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay, with a 10% drop in production?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Yes, okay. And then just lastly on Africa just coming back to Ahafo, which was one of the other mine, is it still expected to see some grade decline in the second half?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","At Ahafo \u2013 yeah, what you're going to see is we completed the Amoma pit, so we're talking all of our ore out of the Subika pit now at Ahafo. So the grades are a little bit down in the second half through Ahafo.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. Okay, well thank you for that. And then maybe Gary just coming back on to just what's happening with Barrick and the negotiations on your autoclave, and how is that's working out?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. We obviously have our toll milling agreement with them that comes due at the end of the year, and we'll be in discussions with them to work through what the next steps are.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","So you are in discussions now, with them?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. Okay. Look forward to hearing on that. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tanya.","Operator","This will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for his closing remarks.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Great. Thank you for joining our call this morning. We started 2017 from a position of strength and built on that foundation in the second quarter by delivering 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of $884 per ounce, improving our cost, production and capital guidance, progressing the next wave of growth projects and increasing our dividends to shareholders.","We also strengthened our ability to execute our strategy by maintaining superior safety environmental, social and governance performance, and developing one of the strongest teams in the mining industry. Thank you, again and have a safe day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

(Operator Instructions) I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","John Seaberg","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont\u2019s First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer and other members of our executive leadership team who will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to Slide 2, as always, I\u2019d like to refer you to our cautionary statement as we will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks as further described in our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gary Goldberg.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to start with safety, our most important value. For the second straight quarter Newmont kept its injury frequency rate lower than 0.5 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. This constitutes sector-leading performance.","There\u2019s some notable successes driving this outcome. Our teams at Phoenix and Waihi set new records at both sites by exceeding 200 days working without an injury and our team in Africa is leading the pack with our lowest reportable injury rate. I\u2019ll take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our employees and contractors for these results as we continue on our journey toward zero harm.","Turning to Slide 4, our primary goal is to build a more resilient business. This is more important than ever given the increasing volatility in the gold sector. To reach this goal we will continue to focus on profitable production, sustainable cost improvements, better mining fundamentals and building only the best projects. This allows us to maintain our strong balance sheet, our gold price linked dividend and ultimately strong returns to shareholders.","Moving to Slide 5, lower production impacted our financial results for the first quarter of the year. We are working to turn that performance around on two fronts. First, continuing our sustainable cost and efficiency improvements, and second, building the foundation for significant free cash flow improvements in 2014 and 2015 with the start up of a team in Ghana and the transition to higher grade ore at Batu Hijau in Indonesia.","Last week we announced that our Board approved a second quarter gold price linked dividend of $0.35 per share. Our dividend is stable compared with the first quarter of 2012 and represents a payout of just under half of our adjusted net income.","On Slide 6, you\u2019ll see that lower production was the most significant contributor to lower adjusted net income. Weaker average realized gold and copper pricing also played a role. These factors are partially offset by lower advance projects and exploration spending.","On to Slide 7, first quarter gold production was impacted by lower ore grade and recovery primarily in North America. Nonetheless we remain on track to meet full year guidance of 4.8 million to 5.1 million ounces by year end. In particular we expect a stronger second half for the year led by improved mill throughput in Nevada and new production at Akyem in Ghana. Copper production in the first quarter was in line with our plans and we are maintaining our annual outlook of 150 million to 170 million pounds.","On Slide 8 you can see first quarter production by region. In Nevada we are addressing the grade and recovery issues. In Australia and New Zealand we are meeting production targets. In South America we had lower mill grade at Yanacocha but are tracking ahead of full year guidance. In Africa lower mill grade Ahafo affected production for the first quarter. At Akyem we still remain on budget and schedule to reach first production later this year. And in Indonesia we\u2019re on course for the stripping program and will be mining higher grade ore in late 2014.","On to Slide 9, sustaining and development capital is down 31% compared to the first quarter of 2012, and lower in every region. Highlights include completion of Emigrant in Nevada, deferral of the Tanami project in Australia until project economics improve, reduced spending on Conga as we progress our Water First Program.","Turning to Slide 10, you will see that lower production volume accounted for nearly three quarters of the increase in CAS from Q1 2012. Other factors included higher input costs which were basically labor, energy and the new carbon tax in Australia.","Moving to Slide 11. We are building on the approximately $130 million in cost reductions we achieved last year with $217 million in lower spending compared to Q1 2012. These savings are realized in our projects and exploration sustaining capital and other expense areas.","All in sustaining costs for the quarter are tracking below the midpoint of guidance for the year. This is a great start but we have more to do. We are also addressing operating costs through our Full Potential Program, which was launched at Boddington earlier this year. This program is underway and it will significantly improve our planning, mining, processing and maintenance efficiencies.","To provide further leadership to our efforts in this area, Chris Robison will join Newmont as Executive Vice President, Operations and Projects, on the first of May. Chris is one of the best operators in the industry and has a solid reputation for sustainably improving safety, costs and profitability at mining and refining operations around the world.","Turning to Slide 12, here is an update on our major projects. In Nevada, we recently received full funding approval for the Turf\/Leeville vent shaft, from the Board. This project will improve grades and facilitate further exploration when it comes on line in 2015. We will also be in production at Phoenix Copper Leach by the end of this year, which will generate value from what is currently waste.","Finally, we are moving forward with drilling and permitting at Long Canyon and continue to target first production by 2017. In South America, the Water First approach at Conga continues and we expect first reservoir to be completed within the next two months. We also continue to negotiate a mineral agreement with the government of Suriname to develop the Merian project.","In Africa, Akyem remains on schedule and on budget for first production by late 2013. The Subika underground project has been put in care and maintenance while we further evaluate project economics. And finally in Indonesia, Batu Hijau will be back to mining primary ore in late 2014. We\u2019ve ventured in to another extension to 26 July 2013 for the share sale agreement with a goal to complete the 7% divestiture in the second half of the year.","Turning to Slide 13, you\u2019ll see that Newmont has significant financial flexibility. We continue to manage our liquidity position and capital structure to an investment grade profile. Most of Newmont\u2019s debt is long dated with favorable terms. We currently have more than $5 billion in available liquidity, a solid investment grade credit rating and ratios that demonstrate the health of our balance sheet.","I should also mention that Tom Mahoney, our Treasurer, has agreed to serve as Interim CFO. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Russell Ball for his many contributions to Newmont and wish him the best in his new endeavors.","Moving to Slide 14, I\u2019ll point out that Newmont\u2019s gold price linked dividend is designed to provide appropriate financial flexibility in all gold price environments. Although we continue to be bullish in the long-term prospects for gold, the gold price declines in the near-term are planned dividend declines accordingly. As a result our second quarter dividend is lower than the first quarter reflecting the reduction in the average LME gold price.","Wrapping up on Slide 15, it has been a challenging start to the year for the gold industry. Despite these headwinds, Newmont is delivering steady and sustainable cost improvement as demonstrated by our 13% reduction of consolidated spending for the first quarter compared to last year. We\u2019re also executing further operating cost and overhead improvements and they\u2019re on track to achieve our full year production and cost targets. We intend to build on this performance and look forward to keeping you informed about our progress.","Thanks very much and I\u2019d like to now open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) First question comes from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Good morning, Gary. Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. My question is regarding capital and if you could just update us on the large capital projects particularly Conga in terms of what would be required to finish up that project getting it to the Water First stage and if you\u2019re thinking on that project has changed at all, given the recent down dip we\u2019ve seen in gold prices?","Gary Goldberg","No, thanks, Jorge. The plan for this year was to spend a consolidated $300 million, as we look to both build the two water reservoirs that we had planned to build this year, but also wind up engineering and certain equipment receipts and make sure we could get their equipment that we\u2019d already purchased put into a good position.","We continue to look at how we get social acceptance for that project and the work we\u2019re doing on the ground there, and also look at the economics of the project. Clearly we keep an eye on where short term prices have gone, but that\u2019s one of the other criteria, where are prices going and where are economics for the projects going for the longer term to make that decision on whether we proceed, beyond just the Water First we\u2019re working on now.","Jorge Beristain \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And I guess my question is, what would be the next natural junction in terms of dates that you could make the decision to proceed fully with the project or not? I\u2019m assuming that would be out by 2Q 2014, but how are you handling the ordering of long lead equipment that would be tied to a potential go or no go decision? And do you have optionality on any of that equipment that is being ordered to not go through with it, if you decide by next year not to proceed with the project?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah. We basically, once we made the decision to move to the Water First, stopped any further acquisition of equipment, but we had a good deal of the major equipment, the mills for instance, motors, and even the mining equipment was on order.","We\u2019ve placed some of that equipment, that we could sell, and we\u2019re looking at a total of between $200 million and $300 million in mining equipment that we\u2019re, we\u2019ve been able to place some of that already and continue to place that in the market place. So there\u2019s no more long lead time items that we have out, and really the mills are the long lead time items and those we\u2019ve got purchased and held in inventory.","Operator","Okay. Next question comes from Michael Dudas. Your line is open.","Michael Dudas \u2013 Sterne Agee","Of Sterne, Agee. Good morning, everybody.","Gary Goldberg","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Dudas \u2013 Sterne Agee","Gary, following up on some capital thoughts. The $100 million reduction you announced, is this just what you found over the last three months? Is, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s an ongoing process, but is it going to be gold and copper price dependent, or do we anticipate more squeezing of that budge as we move through 2013? And then as we look out 2014 and 2015, that 60, 40 mix between sustainable and growth, where are we going to be in the mix looking at 2014, assuming gold prices are still relatively under pressure?","Gary Goldberg","Okay. Thanks, Michael. The $100 million really comes as we look at spend we had the Lone Tree mill that we\u2019re looking to restart and some work on the underground in Vista Vane in Nevada and we\u2019ve backed off on those right now as we\u2019ve looked at the economics in this price environment. So those were tied to that.","As we look beyond that, we\u2019re taking through this full potential process I talked about a very hard look at all of our sustaining capital spend where we can improve, where we might be able to defer. Keep in mind we\u2019re looking to make sure these are sustainable cost reduction so it\u2019s not just cut today and then put ourselves in problems tomorrow so we\u2019re making sure as we do these evaluations we\u2019re doing it for the longer term. So in terms of the split between development capital and sustaining capital we I\u2019m going to ask Randy Engel to give you an overview on what that looks like.","Randy Engel","Hey, Mike.","Michael Dudas \u2013 Sterne Agee","Hey, Randy.","Randy Engel","So we\u2019ve got really three main areas where we expect capital to be down between 2013 and 2014. Really we expect roughly on attributable basis about $0.5 billion down in between this year and next year, broken fairly evenly between Africa, South America and our North American operations primarily in Nevada.","Michael Dudas \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay. My follow-up is looking at Akyem, what are the guide posts or milestones to look at to make that a successful start-up and how confident as we look towards the end of the year that that would be such?","Gary Goldberg","I think from my standpoint completing the construction they\u2019re finishing up the reticulation, getting the power lines in which is a major milestone. I visited there a couple of months ago and all the different elements are coming together while the mine we\u2019ve actually got the material stock pile so we\u2019re in a position. We\u2019ve got the ore ready to go.","This is completing the construction of the mill and then doing all \u2013 really it\u2019s electrical hookups is the big part. This mill is very similar to the mill we have at Ahafo so in terms of startup and debugging and things like that we don\u2019t expect any major issues. We do plan for a normal sort of ramp up but since it\u2019s one that\u2019s very similar with what we\u2019ve done in the past we\u2019re comfortable with that and we\u2019re still looking to see first production by the end of this year.","Michael Dudas \u2013 Sterne Agee","Terrific. My follow-up question is how do you foresee or how is the progress and when do we could anticipate announcement of a new CFO?","Gary Goldberg","We continue to go through the process of interviews. As I mentioned earlier we\u2019ve got Tom Mahoney who\u2019s taken on or will be taking on the acting CFO role from May 2 taking over from Russell and he\u2019ll provide good leadership for the team in the interim.","Michael Dudas \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay. Thank you, Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks.","Operator","Next question David Haughton, BMO. Your line is open.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO","Good morning and thank you for the update. You had mentioned an approval for Merian. Can you just let us know where you\u2019re at with that project, what you need to move forward on it and what the broad economics might be?","Gary Goldberg","Sure, David. Merian continues \u2013 we continue to work with the government of Suriname on getting a mineral agreement that would allow us to potentially develop the project. We\u2019ve been in discussions with the government and had reached an agreement and it\u2019s now in front of the Parliament in going through a process of review there before it gets approval.","I can\u2019t speculate on how long that would take. I think it could take anywhere from weeks to months but that\u2019s a key first step for us getting the approval on the ground there with the government. We\u2019ve done some really good work on the ground with the local communities. I\u2019m pleased with how that\u2019s gone.","I actually visited there earlier this year to get a flavor of how that\u2019s going. But once we get that approval then it would need to go in front of our Board for approval if we deem the economics are such to carry forward.","I think the economics are fairly resilient. It is a new country for us but there are others that have operated there and operated very successfully so that that gives me some confidence that that\u2019s something we could do there as well. So in terms of timing it\u2019s really dependent first on getting that agreement with the government. That\u2019s really the main milestone here that I\u2019m looking at to begin with before we take things forward the next step.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO","All right. Just stepping back a little bit. We have had some concern clearly in the marketplace about the free cash flow positions of most of the larger gold companies. We\u2019ve a number of your competing companies talking about savings in the cost department.","You\u2019ve already discussed your savings for this year. Randy discussed potential for further savings next year. Have you been running the numbers internally as to what you could be thinking about for a saving on the exploration spend, deferral of projects [and need] [ph] mines would come in to question in the lower gold price environment?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, and in fact we already started that process last year in terms of what I call tightening the belt on our exploration and advanced project spend so the $130 million in savings last year carries on into this year and then we tightened the belt further, not so much cutting out exploration because it\u2019s still an important part for where we looked at ounces and economic and profitable ounces to our reserve and resource space but looking at where it may be more expensive to do exploration.","So we\u2019ve cut back in certain areas where for instance it takes helicopters to get out to the sites and we don\u2019t have as much potential for near-term discovery so we\u2019ve been trying to ratchet those areas back in particular. But clearly we look through in our normal planning process even before the downturn that occurred here within the last month. We continue to look at our business in a variety of different gold and copper price scenarios to make sure that we can work through the cycles.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO","And has some of that responsibility also had been pushed down to the mine level where they are looking to make sure that they are doing the best they can on the cost front, given weaker metal price?","Gary Goldberg","David, that\u2019s exact, that\u2019s where it has to happen, is at the front line. Exactly.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO","Okay. Thank you, Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks.","Operator","Next question, Paretosh Misra, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, guys. A question on your capital structure. Is there any debt to EBITDA level which you are going to target?","Gary Goldberg","I\u2019ll hand that over to Tom.","Thomas Mahoney","Good morning. You know we don\u2019t have definitive targets, but we certainly track more towards investment grade metrics. You know, I think that if you read some of the analyst reports from the credit agencies, you\u2019ll see some targets they establish. We may trend towards those as a marker, 2.5 is kind of what people would highlight as a target. So in general, it\u2019s a guideline.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. And second, on Nevada. Can you talk a bit more about your expectation on mill throughput this year? What the trajectory is going to look like?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. We\u2019ve got typical mill maintenance that will occur in the second quarter at Carlin, so we expect that normal down dip that we get in the second quarter will occur the second quarter, so we expect stronger throughput in the second half there. At Twin Creeks where we had also the lower grade, we see that improving, but also in the second part of the year. So as much as I\u2019d like to have things front-ended in terms of production, we have got a hole to dig out of there in the second half of the year, and that\u2019s what Tom and the team are working on.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And my last question on Long Canyon, was there any additional drilling done there in the first quarter? Thanks.","Gary Goldberg","There has been some additional drilling, but we haven\u2019t made any changes. We tend to look at the reserve resource picture at the end of the year.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks.","Operator","Next question, Patrick Chidley, HSBC. Your line is open.","Gary Goldberg","Hello, Patrick?","Patrick Chidley \u2013 HSBC","Get on line into current maintenance. Can you give us an idea of how much that is in resources at the moment, and\/or reserves? And what the key issues are driving you to do that, because my understanding was that\u2019s quite a high grade deposit.","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, it\u2019s higher grade, Patrick. They\u2019re referring to, we missed the first part, but I think you\u2019re referring to Sabika and the underground there at Ahafua in Africa.","Patrick Chidley \u2013 HSBC","Yup.","Gary Goldberg","We had been going through a process of permitting and exploration drilling. We\u2019ve installed basically a decline and done exploration work at depth, at this stage the grade is clearly higher than the open pit, but not high enough to warrant full development at this stage and replacement of the open pit tons that we have, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re putting the mine on care and maintenance at this stage, so grades are higher.","I expect it\u2019s going to be developed at some point in time, I just, it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s not the right direction to go today given the open pit resources that we have available to feed the mill.","Patrick Chidley \u2013 HSBC","All right. I just wanted to find out, how much of your reserves and resources are in that project, so what percentage or how many million ounces?","Gary Goldberg","Okay, I\u2019ll have to take a look at the numbers here.","John Seaberg","Hey Patrick, its John. I can get back to you on that after the call.","Patrick Chidley \u2013 HSBC","No problem. Okay. Thanks. And then the other questions, just quickly on Ghana again is the Ohafo mill any idea of CapEx and timing and what the impact would be for the expansion then?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah. We\u2019re still in the process of going through the pre-feasibility work on the Ohafo mill expansion and actually looking at potentially, not just the single sag and ball but two sag mills and a ball mill to take the capacity up because as we go deeper the ore hardness increases, so to maintain production you look at a bigger expansion. Today we\u2019re looking at a capital cost in the range of about $500 million but we\u2019re still going through that work. That project comes through for next stage review closer to the end of this year.","John Seaberg","Once again, I think the point that I\u2019d make on that Patrick too, is the mill would be a carbon copy of what we\u2019ve got there already, so all the expansion it\u2019s not like we\u2019re out having to redesign and re-engineer something fit for purpose, it would be very similar to what we\u2019ve got at Ohafo no and what we are in the process of completing at Akyem.","Patrick Chidley \u2013 HSBC","Right. And in terms of rough timing, when that $500 million gets spent is that 14, 15 or what sort of timing would you envisage?","John Seaberg","Yep, 14 and 15 would start up, I believe, in 2016.","Patrick Chidley \u2013 HSBC","Thanks very much. Great. And just one point a quick question on the refinery Cambie, have you seen a step-up in demand for the products there, is it very significant?","Gary Goldberg","I\u2019m going to hand over to Tom on that one.","Tom Kerr","Yes. You know in our conversations with management about Cambie they suggested some very healthy physical market and they move a lot of coins and physical. So I think it\u2019s probably just relates to the rest of the gold market, very strong on the physical side.","Patrick Chidley \u2013 HSBC","Great. Okay. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Stephen Walker, RBC Capital Markets.","Stephen Walker \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thank you, operator. Gary, just to follow-up to David\u2019s questions on Mirian. Could you give us a sense of what your huddle rate would be on an unleveraged basis for a project like Mirian ?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah. As I look at that project today, we look at a minimum 12% as our hurdle rate.","Stephen Walker \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And spot price of gold or gold price assumptions? When you look at these projects, how do you \u2013 what do you feel comfortable with when you\u2019re assessing the commodity price environment?","Gary Goldberg","We look at a range and typically, and for this year, our planning price assumption has been $1,500, our reserves are at $1,400, but we would test it down, say, to $1,200 to make sure that the economics still look attractive.","Stephen Walker \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great. Thank you for that, Gary. That\u2019s quite helpful. And just if you could as well, on the Phoenix project, obviously you\u2019re generating copper production that\u2019s applied to the \u2013 as byproduct credits to the Nevada CAS. Maybe just talk a little bit why that\u2019s not broken out as a separate mining project. And then secondly, with the Copper Leach project that\u2019s going to be coming on, will you also apply the copper revenue from the Copper Leach project to the CAS as byproduct credits?","Gary Goldberg","I\u2019m happy to start out with my mining engineer\u2019s explanation and then hand over to get the proper financial explanation. But it\u2019s basically the way we account for all of Nevada, that we\u2019re required to report the copper revenues as a byproduct and the same would apply for the Phoenix Copper Leach that it would work through. But I\u2019m going to ask Russ to add on top of that from a financial standpoint.","Russell Ball","Yeah. Hey, Steve. Gary\u2019s pretty close for a mining engineer, actually, at the end of the day. If you look at Nevada, because of the integrated nature of Nevada, the resources and the people, the processing facilities, we look at Nevada as one combined district versus Australia or a number of largely independent operations.","So when we look at the byproduct, co-product revenue split, we look at it for the entire Nevada region. And because the level of copper is diminimus, we offset that. So you\u2019ll see, I think, it\u2019s 20,000 pounds of copper, not a huge number, coming out of the Phoenix Copper Leach, and that will get reflected as a reduction, again, CAS on our financial statements and we\u2019ll provide the disclosure around quantities like we normally do. And you won\u2019t see that showing up in the revenue line.","Stephen Walker \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you very much for that, Russell, and thank you, Gary.","Gary Goldberg","You bet.","Operator","Next question, Anita Soni, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anita Soni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Morning, gentlemen. First question, commercial production on Akyem, when do you expect that to be achieved?","Gary Goldberg","We expect first commercial production maybe the end of this year but probably early into the New Year. Just, it becomes the timing of that ramp-up I was describing really is what triggers achievement of the first commercial production.","Anita Soni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. On reserve estimation, how should we thinking about your approaches, gold certainly starts to flatten out on the three year profile and perhaps goes into a dip as a three year trailing average next year?","Gary Goldberg","I\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t hear the question.","Anita Soni \u2013 Credit Suisse","So on reserve estimation. Last year you used a three year trailing average, price of gold and some of your competitors have used somewhat of a discount to three year trailing average price. Is that something that you\u2019re going to continue to do? Use the three year trailing average price or would you think about using a discount?","Gary Goldberg","No, I think at this stage, and we used the $1,400 price, the trailing three year would put it higher than that but we\u2019re sticking at the $1,400 at this stage, for our reserve calculations. That may change as we look later in the year but that\u2019s where we\u2019re at today.","Anita Soni \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then CapEx reductions for 2014. I think Randy mentioned $0.5 billion, could you give us a split-out of how much of that is sustaining and how much of that is gross related?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, a good portion of it is tied back to projects. As we look to completing Akyem and reductions that occur at Conga), so the majority of that reduction is tied back to projects.","Tom Kerr","Yeah, in fact the 500 that I was referencing, the roughly 500 was oriented all to development capital. We expect sustaining capital to be reasonably stable, at least in our current plans. But we\u2019re looking for opportunities to pull that back as well. So you will see a change in the mix next year as again, as Gary noted, as Akyem spending comes off and production ramps up, Conga spending comes down and Nevada development capital comes down as well.","Anita Soni \u2013 Credit Suisse","And the last question. It\u2019s been a while I think since this has been addressed, but the five year growth plan, how should we be thinking about what Newmont looks like in five years from now.","Gary Goldberg","I think what I mentioned the last time, still holds. The, we reduced at our Investor Day last year $7 million ounce target for 2017 to the $6 million to $7 million ounce range. And as I talked about on the last call, I still see us in the, probably the $5.5 million range in that timeframe. But it really ties back to the focus on profitable production and even in the current price environment I see that still as an appropriate range to look at out by 2015, 2016, the $5.5 million range.","Anita Soni \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gary Goldberg","Okay, well thank you very much for your participation and your questions this morning. I appreciate your support. Looking forward we\u2019re going to continue to keep our relentless focus on what we can do to improve our cost structure and continue to work safely, so thanks very much and enjoy the rest of your day.","Operator","Okay, thank you. That does conclude the call for today. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time."],"15417":["Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 25, 2014 10:00 AM ET","","Executives","","Kirsten Benefiel \u2013 Director, Investor Relations","Gary J.

Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Kirsten Benefiel, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kirsten Benefiel","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, president and chief executive officer; Laurie Brlas, chief financial officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of our call.","Turning to slide two, I\u2019d like to refer you to our cautionary statement. We will be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks. More information is included in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. You can also find our latest financial information and additional data in the investor briefcase on the financial information page of our website as well.","Now, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg","","Thanks, Kirsten, and thank you for joining us this morning. Our trajectory of strong cost and production performance continued in the first quarter of this year and that\u2019s what we are focused on during this call.","I realized there may also be interest in recent media speculation and therefore I want to address that upfront. We are always opened opportunities that can make our company stronger and benefit our shareholders and other stakeholders. While I cannot comment on roomers or speculation I can tell you that we continue to be focused on running our business. That means meeting our commitments, maintaining our standards, and delivering shareholder value.","Now, I would like to turn to our first quarter results, which include reductions of $82 million in gold all-in sustaining costs, and 4% improvement in gold production over the prior year quarter. Running our operations more efficiently is at the heart of these results and closely linked to our safety performance.","Turning to Slide four. I am pleased to report that we have sustained six straight quarters of industry leading injury rates. Thanks to widespread ownership for working safely and efficiently. However, this performance is overshadowed by the tragic loss of our colleague Simon Donkor, a crusher operator at Akyem operations who died on March 26.","We are taking steps to understand what went wrong and to prevent a similar accident, both at Akyem and at all of our operations. Totalities are unacceptable, but we will honor Simon\u2019s passing by renewing our commitment to safety and we will not led up. Continues improvement is a way of life across all aspects of our business.","Turning to Slide five. Newmont is the premier U.S. based gold mining company and I will take a minute to cover what makes us a global leader. We have a strong asset portfolio with 70% of our production derive from Australia, New Zealand and the United States. We will deliver production of about 5 million ounces of gold per year over the next three years, and 90% of our revenues come from gold.","We lead the gold sector in safety and sustainability, and believe that these attributes are key to both attracting the best people and protecting our investments. As we have demonstrated, we are relentless in our work to improve cost and efficiency. Our team reduced gold all-in sustaining cost by $82 million in the first quarter of 2014 and we are on track to save at least $600 million to $700 million by 2016.","Turning to our balance sheet, we are maintaining financial flexibility in a challenging price environment. Most recently we prepared to reschedule our debt payments and revised our dividend policy to adapt and thrive.","Finally, we\u2019ve established a more disciplined approach to screening investments based on their value and risk profile and our ability to execute. Viewing our assets and opportunities through this lens has helped us prioritize our best organic development options and move forward with divesting assets that are not a good fit.","Now I would like to turn the specifics of what we delivered in the first quarter of 2014.","Moving to Slide 6. Our operation started the year on solid footing, lowering cost, and increasing attributable gold production by 4% compared to the prior year quarter. We set ourselves the challenge to produce gold more efficiently and we are meeting it through improved technical fundamentals from ore body modeling, and mine planning to mill throughput and recovery. We also improved attributable copper production by 20% over the prior year quarter primarily through new production at our Phoenix Copper Leach operation.","I\u2019ll take you through our regional performance starting on Slide seven. In North America, strong production in Nevada was partially offset a loss of gold production in Mexico due to an explosives permitting issue at La Herradura. This issue has been resolved, and the operation is expected to return to full production in the second quarter.","Our Australia and New Zealand operations improved gold production in the first quarter, and production in South America was lower over the prior year quarter, due to planned stripping. We expect production to increase in the second half of 2014 as we reach higher grade ore at Yanacocha. Africa was a star performer, our Akyem operation produced 120,000 ounces of gold at the lowest cost in our portfolio. And in Indonesia attributable gold and copper production was up 14% and 11% respectively due to higher grade ore and higher recoveries. Summing it up, we controlled what we could control which is further reflected in our cost performance.","Turning to Slide eight. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining cost by 8% or $87 per ounce compared to the first quarter of 2013 and we are well below our 2014 guidance between $1075 and $1175 per ounce. The total reduction adds up to $82 million and keeps us on path to reduce cost by $600 million to $700 million over the next three years. It is also worth noting that the reductions we achieved more than offset higher costs in South America related to the planned stripping in the first half of the year. And in Indonesia related to export constrains.","Turning to copper costs on slide 9, copper all in sustaining costs were 9% higher over the prior year quarter due to export constrains at Batu Hijau and cost allocation variances at Boddington, these were partially offset by Phoenix Copper Leach performance. Despite higher costs in the first quarter, we are still on track to meet our 2014 guidance of $2.75 to $2.95 per pound of copper. Lower capital spending played a key roll in reducing all in sustaining costs.","Turning to slide 10, our first quarter capital spending is down by $275 million or approximately 54% lower than the first quarter of 2013. About three quarters of this amount reflects reduced development costs, development capital is lower because we brought the Akyem and Phoenix Copper Leach projects into full commercial production on time and on budget in 2013.","Our current development expenditure is focused on completing the Turf vent shaft where we spent about $20 million in the first quarter of this year of this year. Shaft sinking commenced in January and is on target for first commercial production by late 2015.","We\u2019ve had good success in improving project economics in our organic growth pipeline and we\u2019ll reconsider our development spend for the right opportunity. First cab of the rank is the Merian project in Suriname the team has done an excellent job optimizing project costs and mitigating risks and we expect to reach a decision this quarter the reminder of our capital reductions are due to lowering our sustaining capital expenditure by $65 million.","Although we continue to expect a slightly higher sustaining capital spend in 2014 over 2013 we are making good progress in improving our technical and cost performance at every operation. Let me clarify that were reducing sustaining capital by fundamentally improving the way we run our operations not by pushing costs out. For example we are improving equipment component life through our asset management program.","I\u2019d like to give you couple of examples of our most recent success stories now. Turning to slide 11, as I\u2019ve mentioned before Tanami was one of our weakest operations at the end of 2012. In 2013 we put in new leadership modified our mine plans and ore-body models and improve mill efficiency and throughput. The result was a step change in production and productivity making Tanami our most improved player. We\u2019re seeing the results of this turn around in our quarter results highlights include a 43% reduction in all-in sustaining costs a 40% increase in gold production a 20% increase in ore tons mine as a result of improved planning and performance and a 32% improvement in grade achieved through optimized mine planning. I also want to spotlight what our team in Africa has done to improve the business.","Turning to Slide 12, as we reached the end of 2013 we face challenges at our Ahafo operations due to higher stripping and lower grades. The team met this challenge by reconfiguring its plans to better balance mining rigs and milling capacity and ultimately achieve healthier returns. We\u2019re confident that these changes will improve costs and production and are backing that commitment by revising our 2014 outlook for the region. All-in sustaining cost guidance has been reduced by 13%, capital expenditure guidance has been reduced by 9% and production guidance has been increased by 2%.","Before I pass over to Laurie to discuss our financial performance I want to touch on Indonesia. Turning to Slide 13, we continue to meet with government officials to seek clarity and a mutually acceptable resolution to new regulations governing copper concentrate exports. We also continue to believe that our contractive work protects our right to export copper concentrates and prohibits new taxes. At the same time we\u2019re taking a collaborative approach to resolving this issue which is ultimately in everyone\u2019s best interest and we\u2019re making some progress. We\u2019re about half way through the process required to secure our export permit we\u2019ve completed the first two steps in a four-part process and have received registered exporter status. We\u2019re now awaiting approval of our 2014 work plan which is a prerequisite for receiving our recommendation for an export permit from the ministry of mines.","With this recommendation in hand we\u2019ll be able to apply to the ministry of trade to receive the actual permit. All of this said our copper concentrate barn will reach capacity in the second half of May. If this happens we\u2019ll be forced to implement contingency plans to scale back production.","While we cannot commit to building a smelter ourselves we support the government policy for in country smelting and if committed to provide a $25 million bond towards the construction of a smelter. Finally, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll receive the necessary approval to export over the coming weeks. And that proposed export duties will be clarified. Our ultimate goal is to restore stability, so that we can continue to operate in the near-term and protect asset value in the long-term.","With that I\u2019ll hand over to Laurie to discuss our first quarter financial results.","Mary Lauren Brlas","","Thanks, Gary, and thanks to everyone, for joining us this morning. As Gary mentioned, we are very pleased with our results that indicate a strong operating performance as we have focused on lowering cost and rising gold and copper production. With this focus, we offset escalation and held total cash flat over the prior year quarter. While noticeably reducing overhead cost and sustaining capital spend.","Turning to Slide 15 and comparing Q1 2014 to the prior year quarter. As you can see we experience lower commodity prices, and as a result revenue for the quarter was down approximately 19% over the prior year quarter.","Our GAAP net income from continuing operation was $117 million. This quarter\u2019s net income was impacted by an unusually high tax rate of 55% versus 33% in the prior year quarter. The sale of Midas had a very significant impact on the tax rate for the quarter.","We recorded a pretax book gain of $47 million, but the book tax rate on the gain was 75% due to the fact that related differed tax asset transferred with the sale of the asset and our current capital loss carryover position. That\u2019s $35 million of tax expense on the P&L statement, which obviously resulted in lower earnings for the quarter.","I\u2019ll talk about this in more detail shortly, but we reported adjusted net income of $108 million or $0.22 per share compared to $353 million in the prior year quarter or $0.70 per share.","Cash provided from continuing operations was strong at a $183 million. We continued to be focused on generating positive free cash flow and if we include the sale of the Midas asset, we achieved positive free cash flow for the quarter. Internally, we are very committed to delivering free cash flow consistently and cumulatively.","During the quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.15 per share and as we announced earlier this week, our board approved the dividend of $2.50 per share payable on June 26. This is based on our gold-linked dividend policy and the average gold price during the first quarter of $1,293 per ounce. Turning to Slide 16, we compare adjusted net income for the quarter to the prior year quarter. As you can see price decline was by far the primary difference and without that impact of over $300 million we would have reported higher adjusted net income this year due to the operational improvements we have implemented. The average realize gold price was 1,293 per ounce this year versus 1,631 per ounce last year roughly a 21% reduction our average realized copper price of $2.50 a pound this year versus $3.12 last year was approximately a 20% reduction.","Realized copper pricing was impacted by declining copper prices in Q1 of this year compared to the provisional pricing recorded at year end resulting in a mark-to-market adjustment of $0.37 per pound the lower volumes in the current quarter exacerbated the impact of the mark-to-market adjustment on a per pound basis. Our tax rate was higher than the prior year primarily due to the impact of increased taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Year-over-year we had a slight improvement in total overall cost applicable to sales on the higher volumes the stronger volume contributed nearly $30 million to our adjusted income. We saw significant reductions in overhead expenses such as exploration and advanced projects. G&A and other expense were also down 20% and 48% respectively over the prior year quarter.","After considering all of that we\u2019ve reported adjusted net income of a $108 million or $0.22 per share for the quarter. Turning to Slide 17, we started the year very strong by reporting gold CAS for the quarter of $751 slightly down versus the prior year and at the lower end of our guidance for the year of $740 to $790. This demonstrates cost control and our ability to combat inflation. Looking at the numbers by region we see reductions across the board in gold CAS with the exception of South America and Indonesia. In South America we experienced significant planned stripping and leach pad adjustments in the first quarter and anticipate reaching higher grade in the second half of the year. So we still expect to achieve our full year expected results.","In Indonesia, we continue to experience higher costs until we get to the bottom of the pit where the high grade ore is located these are both timing issues. Looking at the other regions, we see cash declines of 5% to 23%, very strong performance, which is why it is important to understand the detail behind the total unless beyond the timing issues.","For the quarter, we reported copper CAS of $2.71 per pound, up 19% over the prior year. This is primarily driven by Batu Hijau and where we are in the high strip portion of the ore body. Offsetting that, Phoenix delivered a strong quarter with copper CAS of $2.39 per pound, down 25% over the prior year. At this point, we anticipate meeting our copper CAS outlook expectations for the year.","Turning to Slide 18, we continue to be guided by our capital allocation strategy. First, improving financial flexibility, second, enhancing our portfolio to focus on assets with the greatest risk-reward profile, and third, returning cash to shareholders. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.5 billion in cash and no borrowings on our $3 billion revolver.","We generated cash from operations of $183 million. We generated $57 million in proceed from the sale of Midas, and $25 million from the divestment of the Paladin securities. We closed on a term loan to retire $575 million in coverts coming due later this year. And we extended the maturity of our revolver by two years to 2019.","Turning to Slide 19, one of the results of these actions this quarter is that we are now able to lower our interest expense guidance by $25 million. Essentially offsetting this, we are increasing our tax rate guidance to 37% to 40% for the full year. Two primary factors led to this. First, the Midas sale and tax treatment that I mentioned earlier, secondly, we are seeing higher than expected taxes in Peru, as our differed tax liabilities are turning more quickly than we expected.","The Peruvian taxes authorities recently changed the basis for their tax filings to IFRS, which was the major contributor to the change. We do generally expect more volatility in our tax rate quarter-to-quarter due to the valuation allowance since we have in place. Overall this has been a very strong quarter and we are confident in our plans going forward. As Gary mentioned, we are pleased to announce the changes in guidance for the Africa region and confirm our guidance overall across the rest of the organization.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks, Laurie. Summing it all up, we are continuing to build on the momentum we established last year with strong cost and production performance in the first quarter of 2014. This trajectory will continue as we deliver on our commitments for the balance of this year. Before I open the floor to questions I want to leave you with the view of where we\u2019re taking business in the future.","Our vision for Newmont is to lead the gold sector and creating value for shareholders. As we\u2019ve demonstrated we are on track to maximize value in the short-term and to capture the benefits of economic recovery and demand growth in the longer-term.","We set a clear path to improve the business by building a portfolio of longer life, lower cost assets by delivering steady production by making cost and capital discipline part of our DNA by maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and financial flexibility and by replenishing our growth pipeline. Thank you for your time. Once again I am happy to answer your questions about our first quarter performance and our business.","Operator, we\u2019ll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). David Haughton, BMO. Your line is open.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning and thank you. Hi, Gary and Laurie. Quite impressed with the African operations; it's led to a revision of your guidance for the better. Can you just explain a little bit where the beat is coming from in those operations and how sustainable you view it to be?","Gary J. Goldberg","","Yes, thanks David and thanks for joining this morning. In Africa first of all at Ahafo part of the changes that you\u2019ve seen made here in our guidance tieback to the changes we are making in the business last year, when we looked at all our project portfolio and decided to take a look back through all of our projects we pulled out and are reassessing both the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground projects. And those had built into the plans and as people were looking at the plans for 2014 through 2016 they hadn\u2019t gone through the optimization that\u2019s really necessary in the base case and I\u2019ve now done that work.","And the primary piece I\u2019d say is they\u2019ve taken the pit there and the pit plans and pulled them in, brought them in more inline with what you\u2019d need with basically a smaller producing operation. So you\u2019ve matched the stripping more to what we expect in terms of production over the next three years. So I see that as sustainable, I also see the plans that we\u2019re reviewing here this year and into next year on both the mill expansion and Subika Underground is still something that looks very attractive, but we\u2019ve got to do the appropriate homework to make sure that the plans will deliver the value we should achieve from them.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. So the first quarter result in both Akyem and Ahafo on a cash cost basis, well below even the bottom of your revised guidance range. Are you just providing yourself a little bit of leeway, just in case there\u2019s some change in the grade being presented to the mill, or how should we read that?","Gary J. Goldberg","I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable in terms of the grade and what we expect through the year. We are in the process that Ahafo of growing through our workforce reduction, so we do expect some cost to implement that. That will come through and will come through Ahafo\u2019s cost, but we want to make sure we are able to continue and sustain that performance before we make further adjustments to our guidance.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","All right. You made reference to Merian in your discussion with a decision by mid year. I presume that any commitment to that has not been included in your guidance through 2016 on the capital. Is that correct?","Gary J. Goldberg","That\u2019s correct. In fact our guidance from 2014 through 2016, we removed all of those development projects other than the Turf Vent Shaft, which is included in the costs, so that\u2019s included. We have included cost to continue to do the steady work on Merian which we will come to a decision on here in the second quarter. And on the Ahafo projects I just mentioned as well as on Long Canyon.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Okay. So what are the key things that you\u2019re looking for in Merian before you give it the green light?","Gary J. Goldberg","I think from my standpoint, obviously we got to have board approval as one, but the team\u2019s done a good job. We\u2019ve gotten regional \u2013 while we\u2019ve gotten the national governments approval to be able to proceed, which we didn\u2019t have, we\u2019ve got the mineral agreement. We are working up our plans to be able to develop the project, we\u2019ve been working with the same group that ultimately built that Rosebel operation to look at how we would constructed more efficiently with the different model and the normal EPCM model, which we believe is an effective way to build this project in. we need to take this final package together and take it forward to the board for approval.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Would you be able to give us a bit of a thumbnail sketch as to what that mine could look like as far as the throughput and volumes and the costs, et cetera, the whole package?","Gary J. Goldberg","Yes, ballpark with Merian were about 400,000 to 500,000 announces of year of production for the first five years. And that\u2019s up a bit from where we would have been even a year-ago because we spend quite a bit of time drilling in better understanding the ore-body especially what we\u2019ve be encountering in the first three to four years of production just to have a better understanding the first part of the ore-body in fact the first five to six years remaining primarily in the saprolite which is fairly soft material so it allows higher throughput and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve built into the plans as we look going forward on an all in sustaining cost basis we\u2019d be looking at numbers in the around $800 to $900 per ounce range and of course that doesn\u2019t include the development capital terms of development capital the 100% number that\u2019s out there is in the $900 to $1 billion range.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And the size of the plant, and once you move from the softer material into the harder material, what size do you have in mind there?","Gary J. Goldberg","Then and it goes back to the hardness and in bit to the grade and I don\u2019t have that number at top of my head but I am estimating it\u2019s in the 300,000 to 400,000 ounce year range.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Sorry to put you on the spot there.","","Gary J. Goldberg","Just one other thing and to be clear to on power costs because I know that\u2019s one that always comes up, we are not part of the national grid there we\u2019re independent and we have our own Gen sets and right now our estimate based on current world oil costs because we\u2019d been using heavy oil diesel fuel our estimate for electric power cost in the $0.15 to $0.17 per kilowatt range so I know that\u2019s been one question we get a lot of questions from folks on.","David Haughton \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Sure. Given the challenges that your neighbor has encountered in that regard. Okay. Thank you very much, Gary.","","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks, David.","Operator","John Bridges, JPMC. Your line is open.","John Bridges \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co","Good morning, Gary, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wondered with Indonesia, with the presidential election only in July, do you think you can get a resolution before that? And if you can't, do you have flexibility in the pits to move - continue towards the goal of getting into the core of the ore body by the end of this year, early next, or would that be deferred?","Gary J. Goldberg","No, thanks John and thanks for the question on Indonesia. We had actually Indonesia held their parliamentary elections earlier this month. So that part of the election process is complete. I wouldn\u2019t say that it gave any clear leader out there. And it\u2019s going to require several groups to come together in the presidential election to see were the outcome is and then the presidential election as you mention is in July, from our standpoint we continued to have good dialogue despite the elections going on with the various ministries that I\u2019ve mentioned trade, finance and mining. And I believe we\u2019ll see a solution if we don\u2019t see a solution one of the options that we could pursue is to continue mining overburden, but we are right at that fringe where you start to get into ore. What you I would be less inclined to do is to start stockpiling ore, if we got into that situation if we are not able to ship concentrate. And quite frankly from our cash cost perspective, we are very close to that boundary here, and within quite frankly about four or five months of getting into their higher grade ore. We\u2019d probably be better served to reduce our stripping. And that\u2019s what our current plans are, would entail, if we\u2019re forced to go down that path.","John Bridges \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co","Okay. So that would delay the good stuff into next year?","Gary J. Goldberg","Correct.","John Bridges \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co","","Okay. Just following on as a second, from David\u2019s question, the Merian thing, I thought there might have been a decision on that by now. Has there been a delay?","Gary J. Goldberg","No, there hasn\u2019t been a delay. We\u2019ve always said there would be a decision here in the second quarter.","","John Bridges \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co","Okay. Sorry, my mistake. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks, John.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Andrew Quail, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andrew C. Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Gary, Laurie, thank you very much for the update this morning. Solid results. Just got a question on North America\/Nevada. You just looking at your guidance for what capital expenditure from sort of 2014 to 2016, obviously it\u2019s pretty much more than half. I obviously understand the vent shaft is part of that CapEx. What else is driving that down? And then do you see, that outlook of 2016, is that sort of a sustainable number going forward?","Gary J. Goldberg","Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Just a couple of things on Nevada in particular we\u2019ve got some higher striping at both Carlin and at Twin Creeks this year, and we see that coming down in 2015 and 2016. And that higher striping is part of what you\u2019re seeing showing up in the capital cost as well of the way we handle \u2013 in our case we count it as sustaining capital towards the development of those two pits. So we do see that come down and we do see past 2016 that more a sustainable rate.","Andrew C. Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So we can sort of look at something like around a $280 million turn for North America?","Gary J. Goldberg","Yes, the 26 to 28.","Andrew C. Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, and just one on Indonesia. Do you guys \u2013 have you guys got a number for the actual stockpiles of copper content you have there?","Gary J. Goldberg","In terms of specifics and the quantity or the dollar value.","Andrew C. Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","The quantity.","Gary J. Goldberg","Okay, why don\u2019t we \u2013 if we can come back to you on that one.","Mary Lauren Brlas","","We can get back to you, it\u2019s in the 10-Q, but we\u2019ll get back to you on that one Andrew.","Andrew C. Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And one last one on Africa. Obviously it was an outstanding result. I think Dave did ask this question. Obviously the grade's sort of coming down at both. It's obviously about cost cutting. Is there anything specific you're seeing, whether it be power or labor that's actually driving down those costs to a lower level?","Gary J. Goldberg","","Right, I think the key at Ahafo in particular is the resequencing and bringing in the pit sequences and that cuts down the overall stripping. So that\u2019s the main one but then we\u2019re really going through everything our G&A costs and our operating costs in terms of people addressing all those costs. I\u2019m going to ask Chris Robison to just chime in. Chris is our Chief Operating Officer.","Chris Robison","Yes and its, to Gary\u2019s point its primarily driven in the mine by or stepping back from a five shovel operation to a three shovel operation. So you\u2019ve got those operating costs coming out as well as the capital associated with that reduce production scenario.","","Andrew C. Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much. That's all I had.","","Gary J. Goldberg","Great, thanks Andrew.","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) we do have a question from Brian Yu, Citi. Your line is now open.","Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Thanks and congrats on a good quarter, Gary and Laurie. First off, I think Gary, you said on the Indonesia export license you were over two of the four hurdles. Can you clarify if that's exclusive of the proposed export tariff, would that be a separate negotiation from those two of four hurdles?","","Gary J. Goldberg","","Yes, thanks Brian in terms of hurdles or steps that we\u2019re going through basically the final step is up with the ministry of mines one of the things we expect to get clarity on here in the next week or so is the ministry of finance view on what an export tariff might look like. And then how we might address that we will have to take a look at once we get that clarity. So that\u2019s not necessary a direct step, but that\u2019s they will be advising back into the ministry of mines.","","Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. And say you do go through a workforce reduction, what does timing look like if things get resolved and go through the steps of restarting the operations there or getting it back up to 100%?","Gary J. Goldberg","Yes, without going into all the details we do have very detailed contingency plans I think our first step would be to reduce contractors and take that out of the \u2013 take that group out of the system in terms of costs and to reduce our overburdened stripping. And we wouldn\u2019t immediately lay off employees I think it\u2019s important to be in a position to come back if we\u2019re able to reach an agreement so that\u2019s been our approach if we get to that stage.","Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Got it, and then last one here, switching topics a bit. You were able to reduce costs quite a bit at Ahafo. I'm wondering if there are other operations that are on the top of the list for mine optimization work this year?","Gary J. Goldberg","","Yes, we\u2019ve got the full potential project which I\u2019ve described in the past which Boddingtons was the first last year and we\u2019re running it through all of our operations and in fact going through the really the rest of the operations in the organization this year. We prioritized that our highest cost operations were first and are working that through. And I expect to see further improvements throughout the year as we built that in and define specifically what the savings are not keen to put forward estimates without having detailed plans to back that up.","Brian Hsien Yu \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, Thank you","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks Brian","Operator","And our last question comes from Paretosh Misra, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Couple of questions. First, on Merian. Just wanted to confirm that you purchased Alcoa's share, right, in first quarter?","","Gary J. Goldberg","That\u2019s correct we purchased Alcoa\u2019s share in the first quarter.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So you are the 100% owner of Merian right now?","","Gary J. Goldberg","Yes we are a 100% owner and once we come soon we come to decision to proceed, then there is a notice period basically with the government of Suriname, where they have the opportunity based on a factor of historical costs to acquire up to a 25% equity interest in the project and they\u2019ve got a 105 day window to exercise that rate.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, got it. And on Indonesia, I'm sorry if I missed that part of the answer, but is Ministry of Finance not involved in the process?","","Gary J. Goldberg","No the Ministry of Finance is involved but they have an advisory capacity I guess I would say determining what if any sort of export tariff might be applied.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And last one on Nevada. What's the percentage of refractory ore in your feed stock? Is that still close to 80%? And how much spare capacity to process that do you currently have?","Gary J. Goldberg","I know it\u2019s less than 80% but I would have to get back on the detail I am not across the specific details on and I think you are referring well it's less of an issue for Phoenix it's more with Carlin and Twin Creeks but it have to come back on that.","Paretosh Misra \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks","Operator","Thank you. At this time there are no further questions I would now like to turn the call back over to Gary Goldberg, thank you.","Gary J.

All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President Investor Relations. You may begin.","Meredith Bandy","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer and other member of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to Slide 2, before to know any further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary, on Slide 3.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont continued to deliver strong performance in the second quarter and I\u2019d like to walk you through the highlights now.","We reduced our injury rates, maintain steady gold production and lowered our all-in sustaining cost by 14$ per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. This performance resulted in our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow, a 32$ increase in adjusted EBITDA and a 17% increase in operating cash flow compared to 2014.","We also announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor in Colorado and advance the Turf Vent Shaft and Long Canyon operations or mines rather Nevada and Merian in Suriname. Finally, we leveraged strong operating performance to pay down debt and return cash to shareholders.","Turning to Slide 4 to look at our safety performance, I am pleased to report that we reduced our total injury rates by slightly more than 40% this quarter compared to last year. This constitutes Newmont\u2019s lowest ever injury rate and reflects tremendous dedication by our team and significant approve improvement by our contractors.","I particularly want to acknowledge our teams in Ghana and Suriname, who completed the entire quarter working without injury, proving that our goal of zero harm is achievable.","This performance comes down to strong operating discipline, safe facilities and most importantly a sense of accountability for safety that runs throughout the entire workforce.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5 for other quarter highlights. Our strategy has three elements and we are making progress in all fronts. First, to improve the underlying business, we maintain steady gold production more than offsetting the impact of divestments and doubled our copper production. Our gold all-in sustaining costs were just over $900 per ounce, which represents a 14% improvement over the prior year quarter.","Second, to strengthen the portfolio, we announced the acquisition of Cripple Creek & Victor in June and expect the transaction to close in early August. CC&V adds cash flow and production and improves our portfolio mine life, cost and risk profile. We announced the sale of Waihi, which will bring total proceeds from the sale of non-core assets to $1.6 billion over the last two years.","Turning to organic growth; construction at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian and Long Canyon is advancing unscheduled and on budget.","The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated nearly $700 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 32% from the prior year and $119 million in free cash flow. This strong performance allowed us to declare dividend despite lower metal prices and pay down $75 million in debt during the quarter. We\u2019ve remained on track to pay down further debt in 2015.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6 to look at production. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 41,000 tons of copper in the second quarter on an attributable basis. This is slightly more gold than we produced in the prior year quarter and represents a 12% increase after you adjust for divesting Jundee and La Herradura.","Operations around the world contributed to the strong performance. At Batu Hijau, gold and copper production continues to rise and we mine higher grade ore. We\u2019ll continue to mine higher grades through 2017 and our reviewing options for developing the next phase of mining. Boddington also delivered a strong gold and copper production. The team has leveraged the full potential program to improve productivity in the mine through load and haul efficiency and in the mill via throughput, utilization and maintenance improvements.","Twin Creeks produced more gold as a result of planned grades and volumes and improved autoclave performance.","At Tanami, we had another strong quarter, primarily from increased throughput driven by planning and productivity improvements.","At KCGM, we\u2019ve commissioned our new ultra-fine grind mills and saw an improved production for the quarter. And finally, Yanacocha delivered higher leach and mill production.","Turning to Slide 7, and our cost performance, ongoing cost reductions are largely the result of higher productivity and sustainable cost and efficiency improvement. We also benefitted from favorable oil price and exchange rates, which largely offset lower metal prices during the quarter and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures.","We expect our cost to increase slightly in the second half of the year, due mainly to lower production volumes at Ahafo and Yanacocha, but we\u2019ll finish the year well within our improved guidance, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment.","This graph shows our progress over the last three years. Our year-to-date all-in sustaining cost is $879 per ounce and we expect to end 2015 having achieved a 20% reduction from 2012. Putting it all together, we are making the most of our opportunities and managing our challenges.","Turning to Slide 8, Batu Hijau is running at full capacity and we continue to work with the government to negotiate modifications to our contractive work and to renew our export permit. We also negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement that features reasonable wage increases of 3% in 2015 and 4% in 2016 for our representative workforce.","In Ghana, the team has installed 14 megawatts of temporary power generation capacity at Twin and we\u2019ll add another 21 megawatts of permanent capacity at Ahafo by year-end. Both sites are now operating at full capacity.","Labor negotiations in Ghana are ongoing and we\u2019ve remained committed reaching an agreement that offers fare wages and benefits, while sustaining profitable operations. Merian remains on track for first production in 2016 with engineering about 90% complete and construction about 25% complete.","You can see how we\u2019re progressing on the camp, mill, truck shop and power plant in this photo; we\u2019ve also stockpiled just over 500,000 tons of higher grade ore. Finally, we\u2019ve began to work to integrate Cripple Creek & Victor into the Newmont team and into our portfolio.","Let\u2019s turn for more detail on Cripple Creek & Victor on Slide 9. CC&V as a surface mine and heap leach operation above 100 miles from our headquarters in Denver. The operation is about two thirds through a $585 million expansion and we expect the remaining development capital to be fully funded by CC&V\u2019s operating cash flow.","The expansion includes a new mill to augment production, improve recovery and higher grade ore and add capacity for a potential underground operation. The mill is up and running and expected to reach full production capacity later this year. The expansion also features a new recovery plant and second leach pad, which are expected to be in production in the second half of 2016.","CC&V will contribute 350,400 ounces of gold production at all in sustaining cost of between $825 and $875 per ounce in 2016 and 2017. These costs exclude further efficiency and optimization improvement opportunities that we\u2019ve indentified.","For example, we see potential to lower CC&V mining cost by up to 10% by optimizing the mine plant to reduce stripping and eliminate marginal ounces. We also believe we can improve site recoveries by up to 2% by applying Newmont\u2019s proprietary technology.","Longer term, surface and underground expansions could also increase CC&V\u2019s value and mine life, but will require further definition and optimization.","With that I\u2019ll hand it over to Laurie, for an update on financial results.","Laurie Brlas","Thanks Gary and thanks everyone for joining us today. It was a strong quarter for Newmont and I am pleased with our performance.","Turning to Slide 11, as Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our second quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining cost for ounce were both 14% favorable to the prior year. These improvements contributed to EBITDA expansion and our fifth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. Despite an 8% decline in our average realized gold price, the lower cost from operations led to continued strong financial results.","Turning to Slide 12, during the second quarter, we generated more than $440 million in cash from continuing operations and increase of more than 17% from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was also up 32% from the prior year, due to higher grades and recoveries especially at Batu Hijau, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing efficiency improvements.","Consolidate free cash flow was $119 million during the second quarter including increased development capital spending at our projects such as Merian and Long Canyon.","Year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $463 million, almost $400 million higher than the prior year period.","We\u2019ve reported adjusted net income of $131 million in the second quarter or $0.26 per share compared to a $101 million or $0.20 last year.","Turning to Slide 13 for a review of that, adjusted new income excludes a $0.02 per share gain related to discontinued operation, $0.05 per share loss related to impairments and restructuring costs and $0.09 per share impairment of certain differed tax asset.","After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $131 million or $0.26 per share as I noted. The strong quarter operationally was also reflected in adjusted EBITDA of $692 million, up 32% from the prior year. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA excludes impairments, restructuring, acquisition and divestiture costs.","Now turning to Slide 14, at the end of the second quarter, our investment grade balance sheet had over $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents. Excluding the cash we will use to acquire CC&V, adjusted cash is about $2.5 billion. Combining that adjusted cash, our $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities gives us nearly $6 billion of liquidity.","During the second quarter, we repaid $75 million of debt, primarily towards the PTNNT revolver. We\u2019ve also eliminated Ahafo remaining loan balance. This brings our year-to-date total debt payments to $280 million and we\u2019ve remained on track pay down further debt by year-end.","We have no significant debt maturities until 2019 and our current net debt-to-book capital of 17.9% is well below the maximum 62.5% for our revolver covenant.","Newmont\u2019s strong cash flows and enhanced balance sheet provided us with the confidence to maintain our dividend as we announced earlier this week, despite the average gold price for the quarter of $1,192.","Turning to Slide 15, our work to deliver the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As our slide indicates, our net debt-to-EBITDA continues to improve and outperform competitor averages. In a $1,200 gold price environment, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ration of 1 which we estimate will allow us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet across the verity of metal price scenario.","To summarize, Newmont\u2019s strong liquidity and cash flow positions us deliver results across the commodity cycle. We\u2019re comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile, but we\u2019ll continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and strengthen the long term viability of our business.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Laurie. I\u2019ll shift gear now to cover our outlook, turning to Slide 17. We\u2019re revising our production and cost guidance to reflect continued strong performance at our operations and the impact of building Long Canyon Phase 1, acquiring CC&V and divesting Waihi. We expect to produce between 4.7 million and 5.1 million ounces of gold in 2015, up slightly from our previously published range of 4.6 million to 4.9 million ounces.","We also improved our 2015copper production guidance by about 10%, due to a better phase position at Batu Hijau as we\u2019ve been able to make better progress on 50 watering than we planned. Our revised long term guidance calls for gold product between 5.2 million and 5.5 million ounces by 2017 and 9% increase from previous guidance.","In North America, we expect gold production to increase over the three year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft, enter a period of lower stripping at Carlin and add production from CC&V and Long Canyon Phase 1.","In Asia Pacific, we expect Batu Hijau to contribute steady gold and copper production from higher grade ore over the next three years. A planned expansion at Tanami if approved represents additional upside.","In Africa, we expect product to decline over the next three years, primarily due to lower grades at Ahafo. The team is developing profitable expansion projects including an optimized Ahafo mill expansion to increase throughput and offset lower grade ore. And the Subika underground mine which would improve ore grade and add up to 200,000 ounces of production per year, while reducing overall unit costs. These expansions also represent potential upside.","In South America, production is forecast to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017, as new production at Merian offsets maturing operations at Yanacocha. We are working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha and expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016.","We also revised our cost outlook, turning to Slide 18. Our new cost guidance also reflects a lower exchange rate for the Australian dollar of U.S. $0.80 to the Australian dollar, down from U.S. $0.85 previously. Our oil price assumption remains unchanged at $75 per barrel. We now expect our 2015 gold all-in sustaining cost to fall between $920 and $980 per ounce, a 4% reduction from previous guidance.","At the regional level, we\u2019ve reduced our Asia Pacific cost outlook for 2015 based on ongoing cost and efficiency improvements as well as the lower exchange rate. We also improved Boddington copper cost. In Africa, we lowered our cost outlook due to improved year-to-date performance.","Looking out to 2017, we now expect to deliver all-in sustaining cost to between $900 and $1,000 per ounce, down about 3% from our previous range of $925 to $1,025 per ounce. Our long term outlook for copper cost remains unchanged.","Turning to Slide 19 to discuss capital, our capital outlook reflects reduced sustaining capital expenditures at Carlin, Twin Creeks, Boddington and Batu Hijau is offset by addition development capital needed to complete the CC&V expansion. With these changes, we expect 2015 capital expenditure of between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion in line with previous guidance.","We\u2019ve reduced our 2015 sustaining capital outlook due to operating efficiencies and cost savings as well as a modest shift in timing. Our long term sustaining capital outlook of between $850 million and $950 million per year remains unchanged.","Our project pipeline remains one of the strongest in the sector, turning to Slide 20. We create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines and we\u2019ve improved our ability to do that by optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced manner.","We remained on track to reach commercial production of the Turf Vent Shaft later this year. The Shaft will allow us to produce an additional 100 to 150,000 ounces of higher grade ore at Carlin\u2019s Leeville underground mine.","We\u2019re also making good progress at Merian, where we expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounce of gold at all-in sustaining cost of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first five years beginning in late 2016.","I visited Long Canyon last week and I am pleased with the team\u2019s progress. First production from this new and highly perspective oxide gold district is slated for early 2017. We expect Long Canyon to produce between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold per year at all-in sustaining cost of between $500 and $600 per ounce.","In Australia, we expect to reach a decision on our Tanami expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life. The Tanami expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall costs for the first five years. If approved, we would expect production and cost improvements in 2017.","In Ghana, we continued to evaluate an expansion of our existing Ahafo mill to help offset the impact of lower grade ore. We expect to reach a decision later this year and see the potential to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of production at competitive costs.","Lastly, we continued to study ways to extend profitable production from Yanacocha\u2019s remaining oxide and sulfide deposits by optimizing sequencing and recovery. We expect to review initial study findings in mid-2016.","Turning exploration on Slide 21, exploration is a core competency at Newmont and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the sector in value creation. Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base, while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. Nearly 70% of our forecast 2015 gold production was discovered or defined by Newmont geologists.","Early stage exploration projects that hold the potential to be in production in the medium horizon include the Subika underground in Ghana to give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface bit. Long Canyon in Nevada were oxide mineralization has been identified over a three mile strike and remains open in all directions.","Northwest Exodus in Nevada and extension of the Exodus underground mine which would add profitable production and Kacher Maine which is part of the oxide expansion effort at the Yanacocha. Tanami provides a great example of our exploration success.","Turning to Slide 22, our exploration team has successfully grown Tanami\u2019s high grade underground mineralization from 150,000 in 1993 to nearly a 11million ounces. Half of these ounces have already been mined and about half are still in our reserves and resources.","Most of this growth has been driven by extensions of the Callie and Auron deposits, we still hold significant upside. Our team believes there is the potential to double our current reserves and resources at Tanami at comparable grades through extensions at Callie which remains open at depth and at Auron, we\u2019re only 50% of the deposit has been drilled to reserve and resource.","Development of two new discoveries Federation Limb and Liberator and close proximity to our existing underground mine and through our brownfields program with targets like the Soolin Footwall where we\u2019ve drilled intercepts of up to 20 meter at grades of 8.6 grams per ton of gold. All of these deposits can be developed relatively and expensively due to our existing infrastructure with ore processed at our existing mill.","Turing to Slide 23 for closer look at Auron, this long section shows the Callie and Auron deposits along with some of the results of our drilling program today. The gold color represents our reserves, the dark blue shows our resources and the light blue shows inventory or material that is not yet advanced to resource status.","As you can see both Callie and Auron have significant growth potential on top of the more than 5 million ounces of currently declared reserves and resources. As I just mentioned, Callie remains open at depth and much of Auron is still undrilled. We are excited about the drill results today which suggest that extensions are at a comparable thickness in grade with what we\u2019re already mining today. The mineralization is mainly free gold which you can see in this photo.","Turning to Slide 24 for a closer look at the Federation Limb, Federation Limb was discovered in 2013 and is located in a structure that is parallel to Callie, where we are mining today. Discovery is significant in terms of potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure.","Federation\u2019s mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 35 meters and in grade from 2 to 200 grams per ton. We declared an initial resource of 0.5 million ounces at an average grade of 6.9 grams per ton in 2014. This represents about 25% of the potential target and we continue to see higher grades and open mineralization that will be further defined through infill drilling.","Finally, turning to Liberator on Slide 25, Liberator is a brand new discovery made just this year located below Federation. Like Federation, Liberator is significant due to its potential size, grade and proximity to existing infrastructure.","Liberator\u2019s mineralization varies in thickness from 2 to 40 meters and a grade from 2 to 30 grams of gold per ton. We intend to further define the deposit and declare first resource at Liberator in 2016. We are excited about the potential for a longer term growth at Tanami and throughout our portfolio. We\u2019re also prepared to weather headwinds.","Turning to Slide 26, we run our business to maintain flexibility in a verity of gold price environments and update our contingency plans on a regular basis. This chart gives you an idea of what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold price.","Under significant pricing constraints, specific actions we would take include delaying stripping campaigns and sustaining capital expenditures, further reducing overhead and exploration costs and differing early stage projects.","Similarly as gold prices improve, we\u2019ll maintain our cost and capital discipline, continue to advance our most promising projects and exploration prospects and look to accelerate out debt repayment. We are comfortable with how we position the business and believe our success in getting our house in order and optimizing our portfolio and project pipeline is paying off.","I\u2019ll wrap up my comments with a quick look at where we are taking Newmont in the future. Our goal is to be most profitable and responsible gold mining company in the world. We will reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost and technical performance to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower cost asset base and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and continuing to strengthen our investment grade balance sheet.","Thanks for your time. I\u2019ll open the floor to question now, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andrew Quail","Yeah, good morning, Gary and congratulations on a very solid quarter again. It\u2019s a positive trends you got over 12 months definitely. Couple of questions, on the pair issues in Ghana, can you easily give us a split between a Akyem and Ahafo, obviously, Akyem is showing much lower cost in heading in the other way where Ahafo suppose you\u2019ve said grades coming off?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, the power consumption in Ghana it\u2019s about 60 megawatts in total with about 30 megawatts at each of those sites. And what we\u2019ve done is put in the temporary additional power at Akyem and we\u2019re finishing up by the end of this year some addition permanent capacity at Ahafo as we look at the potential to add mill capacity there and the potential for underground, we wanted to base the more permanent power there.","We have since June and went back to running full capacity, while we continue to work with the government and look at different ways to address the power situation over the longer there. We\u2019re now in good shape for continuing and sustaining our existing production base going forward.","Andrew Quail","Thank Gary. And then in mean on that - on your slide 26 which is very helpful. As far as when you talk about the reduced or the divine laybacks and reduced the full cost. Is that server it\u2019s - have you already sort of plan that by specific mines or is that main and how many mines would that be resuming to it?","Gary Goldberg","And what we\u2019ve done Andrew and as we build our plans and this is something we introduced last year and continue to refine this year. We actually build our plans starting from a lower gold price and layer on, what would we start, what runs, what doesn\u2019t. So we started at a $900 price and then continued looking at what comes in both with existing operation and projects. So we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea where we\u2019d go and where we\u2019d focus and where the best value comes as we\u2019d go the other direction and looking. It\u2019s depending ones again how long we expect these thing to last.","Andrew Quail","And just a last one, maybe it associate Kalgoorlie. Obviously there\u2019s been some noise around sort of direct stepping away there. Can you just give us an update what operationally have that - is that impact Newmont and how you see that asset going forward?","Gary Goldberg","No, I think one other things that we completed in this past quarter, we took over and agreed a management agreement with Barrick and we\u2019ve now taken over managing the operation on behalf of the joint venture. It\u2019s still a 50-50 joint venture. We continue to do work and now with this change, we\u2019re also looking at what we might do both in further bringing our systems and approaches in, but also looking at the exploration upside. So it\u2019s something we continue to assess.","Andrew Quail","Thanks very much, Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Andrew.","Operator","Our next question is from John Bridges with JPMC. Your line is open.","John Bridges","Thanks Gary, Laurie and everybody. Again congratulations on the results. I was just wondering with these expansion projects you\u2019re talking about Tanami and Ahafo, what sort of gold price would you need to press the button on those two projects?","Gary Goldberg","It varies on both on them. At Tanami, quite frankly because it\u2019s - well both of them quite frankly are incremental expansions. We see prices that would support good double digit returns. It could below even a $1,000 per ounce. We\u2019ll give more information as we assess those here in the third and the fourth quarter and bring them forward, but that\u2019s where I see quite frankly both of those.","John Bridges","Okay. And then following on the layback question, and looking at your results from last quarter, your layback, your strip ratios are following most of the mines. Is that normal value variation or was there a degree of sort of adjusting to another price already in your numbers?","And then I was in tread at - what was it - at Twin Creeks, the strip ratio there is much higher but is not showing up in the cash cost, I just wondered what was driving that?","Gary Goldberg","Okay, I\u2019ll take the first part on Carlin and Boddington in terms of strip ratio, because those are probably the two biggest drives of Carlin being the biggest. And I was just out there last week and have a pretty good handle on what\u2019s going on. I think the big difference is then we\u2019ve had material that was originally characterized this waste, it\u2019s now become ore, so that\u2019s a good thing in terms of mineral model but it also results in lower stripping. So what we\u2019d expected to be stripping is waste is now ore. That ore has a longer haul when and you\u2019ve been out there, so taking it from the Northern pit down to where the mill is does require a longer haul, so that\u2019s taking up the truck capacity and lower stripping.","At Boddington, it\u2019s been changes to the mine plan that we implemented earlier this year and really the shape and that\u2019s allowed us not just for this year but going forward to reduce some of the stripping.","Twin Creeks, the question there was - now Chris Robison is going to address Twin Creeks\u2019 question.","Chris Robison","Yeah John, I think it follows on with Gary commented on about Carlin in the longer hauls. The hauls right now at Twin are actually, well we continue to strip at a pretty high pace there. They are high in the mine, so pretty short hauls actually and we\u2019ve done redesigns on where our dumps are and the hauls that of even shorten that more, so that\u2019s probably the key to cause not up significantly as stripping continues.","John Bridges","Well, okay. And then maybe the longevity of how long you could delay some other stripping, how much flexibility you built into your mine plans?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, we\u2019re really not delaying the stripping. This is both we modified the mine plan at Boddington and at Carlin it\u2019s really a more a matter of the switch from ore to waste, so we\u2019d be back into the normal sort of stripping going forward.","John Bridges","Okay, got it. Thanks a lot and well done guys.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you, John.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Walker with RBC. Your line is open.","Stephen Walker","Thank you very much. Thank you, Gary and team. Just a couple of questions Gary, if you could in previous calls there\u2019s been more granular discussion on which projects, which smelting, copper smelting projects in Indonesia that you could be considering investing in as part of renewal process for the copper concentrate export progress here. I know it comes up for renewal in September, could you give us some color on your level of confidence that you get some news on that renewal of the copper concentrate export permit?","Gary Goldberg","Sure, thanks Steven. I think couple of things. Obviously, we continued to watch and see how Freeport progresses with their discussions because they are - I know the first cab of the rank with their permit do here this month are as due as you said in September. I met with a number of government officials earlier this year and more recently met with the Minister of Mines and Energy as he was here in the U.S. to just talk about the progress and where we are both in terms of the modifications to a contracted work and the permit extension. And we do continue to discuss with several parties the potential of participating in a smelter and supporting the country\u2019s policy of having in country processing. Those were at different stages with different parties and I am not really have liberty to get into the details on those other than we continue to progress that.","I do think there is desire in country that\u2019s continued to see the operations run as we work together towards a solution. Now I have encouraged as I was when I visited in March and that resulted in getting our extension in March. We\u2019ve got work to do and they are just coming out of a holiday period here primarily through the month of July and we\u2019re looking to get reengaged in detail on these discussions in August with the government.","Stephen Walker","Great, just as follow-up on that too. You are going to be benefitting from the Phase 6 high grade, when do you have to make a decision on the pre-strip for the Phase 7 or and what are the metrics vis-\u00e0-vis gold and copper prices that makes at a go or no go or is it a forgoing conclusion that it is a go at this Phase 7 strip at this stage?","Gary Goldberg","No, Stephen, a good question, it\u2019s one of the things in why we are encouraging getting resolution on the contractor work, so we know that we have the certainty in terms of how we\u2019re going to look out in the future for development of Phase 7. Phase 7, we really get into larger spending for striping in particular early next year, so we\u2019re really targeting through the end of this year, we\u2019ll look at it. The same way we do with all of our different options at different price scenarios to see what it make sense, how it make sense to bring it forward, how it make sense to finance that particular investment because it\u2019s about five years of striping, we\u2019re doing work with the team there to look at ways to maybe reduce that a bit and improve the cost profile and how we can drive things.","We\u2019ve just got the full potential program rolled out there and we\u2019re going to see how we can improve our cost position there as well. All that we want to factor in as we make the decision on whether and how to proceed with Phase 7.","Stephen Walker","Alright, I assume that\u2019s not in the capital guidance, that\u2019s been given looking forward?","Gary Goldberg","That\u2019s not in the current capital guidance.","Stephen Walker","If I can change gears a little bit at Merian you are using an EPCM contractor G Corp, this is unusual when we look at what Newmont has done in the past, you\u2019ve not - you\u2019ve always done that sort of internally, can you discuss a little bit how that process is going and whether you think that you could be looking at using contractors or EPCM contractors of this nature going forward?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, no, good point. We have - sometimes we\u2019ve done it internally. For larger projects we\u2019ve actually done it with third parties, you the back goes in the flares and that type. G Mining has had a good history of building projects of this scale and particular in Suriname, Luis [ph] has done a good job there and continues to do a good job for us, so it\u2019s a different model and it\u2019s one that we believe allows us to build projects affectively safely and at a lower cost than what we\u2019ve been seeing through some of the other model. So we\u2019re giving it a bit of a try here how it might apply in other place.","I think once you start to get much larger project in this, that model may not fit, but I think for the most of the projects we have in our project pipeline this sort of model is something that makes good sense. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re given in a try and as I said we\u2019re seeing good progress there. We\u2019re at 25% project completion year-to-date and that\u2019s progressing very well on the ground.","Stephen Walker","Great, and just one last question Laurie, if I might ask, both gold and copper revenues were lower in the quarter than the average price in the quarter, is that just a timing issue on gold and copper concentrate sales?","Laurie Brlas","Definitely on the copper concentrate sale there is a bit of a timing issue. On a year-to-date basis I think we are pretty solid on gold and we see continuing to hit the numbers for the rest of the year. Copper will get back from that timing gap.","Stephen Walker","Or it should improve into the third into the third quarter just on a PP or prior period pricing adjustments?","Gary Goldberg","Yes.","Laurie Brlas","Yes, that CCR feeds well affect that and we also have mark-to-market adjustments more still again on the copper and gold.","Stephen Walker","Thank you, Gary. Thank you, Laurie.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Stephen.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jorge Beristain","Hey good morning, everybody, Jorge Beristain of DB. I guess my first question is maybe for Laurie, just more of a technical accounting question. Your year-end \u201814 reserves stood at about 82 million ounces and 17 years of mine life, but that\u2019s based on $1,300 gold. So I was wondering if you could provide any kind of sensitivity around where your reserves could go at current spot of around 1,100 and if you believe that from an accounting point of view, you are being sufficiently conservative enough using that $1,300 gold price in light of the recent move?","Laurie Brlas","Yeah, we will certainly evaluate that as we get towards the year-end. And as you know, we have to be at or below the three year trailing average by SEC requirement. We\u2019ve historically been below that. But given what we\u2019re seeing, you could see some kind of a change and we provided the sensitivity on that in the past what would happen, but we also in those sensitivities assume consistent are the dollar that what we saw a year ago. So I think you\u2019d see some of that adjustment would be medicated.","Gary, you want to add on that?","Gary Goldberg","No, I think we have in those reserve calculations, we left the Aussie dollar at parity dollar for dollar and the oil was at a $100 per barrel. So as we - we assess reserve reporting at the end of the year and making a potential reduction in that reserve price, we would include also those changes in the Aussie the oil price and also the improvements we\u2019ve seen in our operating cost throughout the business.","Laurie Brlas","And that wouldn\u2019t have a direct - an adjustment like that would not have a direct impact or impairment on the balance sheet. What you might see if we reduced our reserves would be a bit higher depreciation and amortization next year as that would imply some shorter mines but there been a direct impairment.","Jorge Beristain","Got it, thank you. And just Gary, my second question is a bit more of a strategic nature, but seeing last week\u2019s aggressive pullback in some of the gold equities and it does seem like we\u2019re seeing some sort of investor fatigue or and\/or capitulation toward gold and by extension the gold equities. Could you comment us to what you are hearing at the board level not only at the Newmont board or maybe within the industry as to what the industries planning to do in order to stay relevant as an asset class toward institutional investors which require certain thresholds for market cap and liquidity and just in other in short is M&A potentially back on the burner in 2016 if we continue see gold prices say below a 1,100?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, I\u2019ll make it clear that M&A isn\u2019t that top end of our priority. We\u2019re really focused on running our existing business well and delivering results. I think as it\u2019s been highlighted continuing to deliver the results that we say we\u2019re going to, continuing to look at ways to improve the businesses, the way to earn the creditability of shareholders. As an industry, I think we\u2019ve got different participants going after it in different ways. I think we\u2019ll see some that will do well and perform well through this price environment. We\u2019ve got others that I am sure will get challenged just by the nature of how they going to cross and gone after their cost, improvement and efficiencies.","We\u2019ve really focused over the last couple of year with our board and what can be done to sustainably improve and efficiencies not just do something that\u2019s flushing the pan for a year or two. And I think that\u2019s just as important from a shareholder standpoint look at it. So our discussions with shareholders, our discussion with our board and we just completed those discussions here recently with our most recent board meeting. We\u2019re really focused on making sure we continue to deliver, stay within our strategy, make sure the foundation is going well, make sure we\u2019ve got good financial capacity, keep an eye on the balance sheet, keep an eye shareholder returns as you saw with a divided that we believe we\u2019re positioned well to be able to pay that dividend even though it fell below our current guideline and those of the sorts of things that we\u2019ve been discussing and focusing on it.","I think in terms of the market, I\u2019ve always been saying keep an eye on both what\u2019s happening with ETS and what\u2019s happening in China. And I think the announcement last week on China came out is unfortunately a bit of a negative surprise, but quite frankly there was an increase in gold reserves that China had. And the underlying fundamentals of demand in Chain for gold still remain strong. Last quarter was the fourth strongest quarter in gold demand in China. So I think that\u2019s good, I think India continues to play well in that. The overall potential headwinds that people see in the U.S. economy performance and interest rates sit out there. I think quite a bit of that I would expect this price still but I think where things go actually getting some of those things to happen in terms of interest rates finally moving. So the speculation stops and we move pass that stage will be important.","But we\u2019re in it to the long term. We want to make sure the business is positioned to work through the different swings, ups and down. And so we\u2019re not having to shoot from the hip and come up with short term sort of approaches to addressing the business fundamentals. And I think we\u2019ve really worked hard here at Newmont to make sure that we\u2019ve positioned the business to survive well through these sorts of swings.","Jorge Beristain","Okay, great, thank you. And I just wanted to reemphasis, when I said M&A I really meant consolidation in terms of sorted mergers of equals, but I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks very much.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Jorge.","Operator","Our next question is from David Haughton with CIBC. Your line is open.","David Haughton","Yes, good morning, Gary, Laurie. I am David Haughton from CIBC. Got a couple of operational questions for you, in your commentary Gary, you\u2019d mentioned the watering programs at Batu Hijau have a potential full better grades going forward what nearly it down at the bottom of the higher grade portion that beating the dry season. Does the watering have a material improvement beyond the second and third quarter?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, I think as we looked at it and we have to see what happens with the rain as you point out. But we\u2019re about 50 meters below where we expected to be in terms of water level in the pit and it\u2019s spend because it\u2019s been drier but we also installed an additional the watering pipeline to make sure if rain came more than expected we\u2019re in a better position. So that\u2019s all helped. That could help and that\u2019s one of the things, we do our plans for \u201816 and \u201817 because we would have planned in \u201816 a period where we actually came out of the pit bottom and it could position us better, but that\u2019s part of what well assess when we do our \u201816 plan.","David Haughton","Okay, and also as a throughput at Batu Hijau has been picking up quite well in the first and second quarter this year. Should we expect it to be at those sort of levels going forward?","Gary Goldberg","I think it\u2019s a combination, as we\u2019re in the lower part of the ore body, the higher grade - higher grade is also softer ore and higher recovery. So all those go together to really result in the better results.","David Haughton","Okay, just switching continents to Ahafo continue to get good cash cost results there but your guidance is quite a bit hard than what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of this year. Are you expecting some higher costs in the second half of the year with potentially all graded higher strip or some other factors?","Gary Goldberg","The combination of two things, one would be grade is expected to drop in the second half of the year and we also expect to see some higher sustaining capital spend that will occur in the second half of the year.","David Haughton","Okay, and then the last one looking at Tanami exploration, do any of those exploration results, have any of them being factored into your thoughts on the expansion?","Gary Goldberg","No, at this stage we are basing the expansion completely on what we have in our reserve base not on the resource or on the rest of what I have just talked about.","David Haughton","Okay, but if you are going to have additional infrastructure on presumably better mobility of fleet et cetera that that could put you in good stead for accessing potentially these new portions of the ore body if they pan out?","Gary Goldberg","No, exactly, we\u2019ve got existing infrastructure but also have potential options. When you recall, we had a shaft option for continuing to expand production there. That could become one that we consider and then there be other potential incremental expansions at the mill we could do depending on what we\u2019d find. But right now, I want to keep the focus keep it stepwise on what\u2019s the most logical mix that based on what we know.","David Haughton","Okay, thank you Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks David.","Operator","Our final question is from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Michael Dudas","Yes, thank you and good morning, Gary, Laurie and team. First question made for Laurie, if you were to looking at 2017 cost guidance of 900 to 1,000, if you\u2019re to mark-to-market energy in $4, is that what a bit of the range would be low end, high end or could that be very helpful of we have these type of metrics over the next couple of years?","Laurie Brlas","We\u2019ve provided those sensitivities in the past and those are included in our materials that certainly we\u2019ve used. The midpoint of our guidance would reflect the energy an $8 assumptions that we\u2019ve got right now.","Michael Dudas","Okay, fair enough. Secondly, when you mentioned, Gary mentioned in his prepared remarks about or maybe you did about net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of target of one, could you just characterize how sensitive that is relative to gold price additional acquisitions, progress on the development project, is that a hard target, is there a timeframe that\u2019s included there?","Laurie Brlas","No, it\u2019s a general guideline and it\u2019s not going to be sensitive to development essentially because that doesn\u2019t affect EBITDA, we\u2019ve got that factored in. It\u2019s really the EBITDA will move, I want to make the point that it\u2019s at a $1,200 gold because our EBITDA will obviously more if the gold price changes. And so if we\u2019re at a one, that\u2019s extremely conservative, if we\u2019re at one at $1,200 and so it fells up a little bit at $1,100 number, but we\u2019re still at a very confident investment grade position.","Michael Dudas","And I wanted to flush it out, thank you. My final question, Gary, I know you talked about some of the labor issues in Africa and in Australia, what - any sense in North America, is there attraction of labor, productivity, any issues on that front that coming ahead over the next 12 to 18 months?","Gary Goldberg","No, no real issues in North America, Peru and quite frankly Australia, we continue to see better labor availability which is evident in the much over turnover rates we\u2019re seeing in our operations in West half. So I think that\u2019s a key point one other things and I mentioned we just had the board in. We spent quite a bit of time with the board talking about talent, talking about succession and what we do to make sure we have a good strong talent pipeline throughout the business, so not just at headquarters but how does that look out into the operations, how does it look from the finance side back in across the region. So it\u2019s one that we spend a lot of time on and it\u2019s one we feel it\u2019s important for us as we try to separate ourselves from the rest of the group.","Michael Dudas","Excellent, I appreciate that. Thank you, good luck, guys.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Michael.","Operator","And we do have one final question. Our final question is from Anita Soni with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anita Soni","Hi. Just one question on Achim, I think this group what there was a little bit lighter than prior quarter, could you just elaborate on that?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, what we had Anita in the first quarter in particular but second quarter for the first two months April and May we had lower throughput as we run the power rationing before we got the rest of the gen sets the temporary gen sets in. So from June we are back at full capacity and that was really the big driver on the difference in mill throughput and we\u2019d expect that as I mentioned, now that we have the additional power capacity to be achieving the more normal levels going forward.","Anita Soni","So the full capacity for the reminder of the year at this point?","Gary Goldberg","That\u2019s correct.","Anita Soni","Alright, thank you very much.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Anita.","Operator","Alright, we have no further question. I would now turn the meeting over back to Mr. Gary Goldberg.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks operator and thanks again everyone for joining our second quarter earnings call. Our team continues to drive stronger performance across the portfolio and the sector. We\u2019ve remained committed to continually improving the business by making our operation safer and more efficient and to building a longer life, lower cost asset portfolio that thrives in all cycles. Our ultimate goal is to create the value in need to fund profitable growth, pay down debt and most importantly generate cash for our shareholders.

For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. 2011 was another step in the transformation of our company as we built upon the strong foundation of our core operating regions and defined the next phase of our evolution. We are continuing to make progress on the strategy we discussed with you at April Investor Day last year. We discussed delivering competitive growth and returns, unlocking our exploration upside, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders through a gold-linked dividend. ","And while strategy sets the future, execution sets the base. So as we've been saying since 2007, everything at Newmont begins with execution. Good performance in our operations allows us to do many things. And in 2011, we delivered again on our original expectation and outlook for the year. Gary Goldberg will talk more about that in a moment. ","Also in 2011, we took tangible steps to move our project pipeline forward. In particular, we announced initiation of construction at Akyem in Ghana, Conga in Peru and the Tanami shaft in Australia, which Guy Lansdown will speak to later in the presentation. And as we have said, competitive returns do require capital discipline. And from time to time, this means that not every project makes it to the next stage of development, and Hope Bay is such a project. And Russell will speak about the financial statement impacts of removing Hope Bay from our development pipeline later in the presentation. ","With respect to the exploration upside, we had a successful year and delivered on our exploration program. As you saw yesterday, we announced year-end reserves of 99 million ounces of gold and nearly 10 billion pounds of copper. To put this in perspective, by year-end 2011, with 5.3 million ounces of net additions, that net additions exceeded the sum of the net reserve additions published by the other 4 North American senior gold companies combined. So for the near term, our exploration team is focusing on numerous opportunities, one of which is Long Canyon, Nevada, and Guy will provide you more information on that momentarily. ","I'd just like to mention another exploration opportunity because Gary Goldberg and I just recently returned from Indonesia, where we were briefed on progress at the Elang exploration project, where we have 2 drill sites working already and we're adding a third. This is a longer-term prospective opportunity for Newmont, which is a large copper gold porphyry with similarities to our Batu Hijau project. And it's projects like Long Canyon and like Elang that underpin our belief that we can continue to deliver reserve additions through the drill bit that will, over time, allow us to discover the Newmont behind Newmont. ","We will pursue our new projects and continue to explore and fund our exploration and development program and return capital to shareholders. We can do all of that because we have a strong base of operating cash flows and a very strong balance sheet. ","In 2011, through our gold-linked dividend, we paid out nearly $0.5 billion in dividends or $1 per share, equating to only 23% of our adjusted net income. And as you know, we designed our gold-linked dividend to enhance investors' leverage to gold price, and it delivers. Since we announced the enhanced gold-linked dividend, Newmont's share performance has more closely correlated to the gold price than any of our peers. ","By delivering on our strong strategy and maintaining our track record of operational execution, all of that underpins the success of this company and we can only accomplish that through the hard work and dedication of all of our employees, contractors and business partners across Newmont. And I want to thank all of those people for their efforts throughout 2011. But I also know that human capital strategy is important for the future and continuing to be able to retain our existing employees and attract some of the best expertise in the industry is important to our future as well. ","And I would just like to acknowledge one example of that in Gary Goldberg, who recently joined us. Gary joined us in December as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and he will speak in a little bit. He was most recently President and CEO of Rio Tinto Minerals and is a past Chairman of the National Mining Association. Gary brings to us 30 years of experience in the mining business and is responsible now for Newmont's worldwide mining operations, health and safety, business excellence and security. Looking forward to having Gary's contributions at Newmont for some time to come. ","Turning to Slide 4. You'll see an update of the growth project pipeline that we originally communicated to you last April at Investor Day. As you can see, our North America and Africa regions each have the potential to contribute approximately 800,000 ounces of annual production growth, while our South America projects, both in Peru and Suriname, collectively have the potential to contribute 1.25 million ounces of annual production growth. ","You'll also see in the yellow box around South America that we have updated our forecast here to allow the indication that we've seen recent activities in Peru. So on November 30, we indicated that we had suspended operations at the Conga project in agreement with the government of Peru. On December 27, the government announced its intention to have a third party re-review Conga's Environmental Impact Assessment, a process that they indicated would take about 40 days. On February 17, the government announced the panel of experts that had been retained to conduct this review. At this time, it's still our intention to develop the 3 projects denoted in yellow on this slide, which include Conga, Cerro Quilish and the Yanacocha expansions. We're encouraged that the EIA review of Conga is underway, and we look forward to hearing the results in the near future. ","However, as we stated back in November, should we be unable to continue with our current development plans at Conga, the scale and diversity of Newmont's global portfolio provides us with flexibility to reprioritize and reallocate capital to maintain our focus on delivering our strategic objectives through potential development alternatives, with alternatives in Nevada, Ghana, Australia and Indonesia. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball, our CFO, and to discuss our full year financial and operating results.","Russell D. Ball","Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, a lot of numbers for the fourth quarter and the year, and I will touch on some of the highlights, with a focus on the full year numbers since these are more reflective of the long-term nature of our business. ","For 2011, we generated record revenue of $10.4 billion; adjusted net income of $2.2 billion or about approximately $4.39 a share; and record operating cash flow of $3.6 billion, clearly benefiting from continued delivery and execution of the business plan and a strong gold price environment. Gold operating margins increased 32% to $971 an ounce despite a 22% increase in operating costs. ","As outlined at our Investor Day last April, the operating cash flow has been and continues to be redeployed back in the core gold business through aggressive development of our project pipeline and through the cash acquisition of Fronteer Gold last April, an acquisition that I believe will add significant long-term value for our shareholders, to fund increased near-mine and greenfield exploration. And as Richard mentioned, in line with our gold price-linked dividend, we returned $1 a share or approximately $500 million to our shareholders last year. ","In addition, we have significantly deleveraged the balance sheet over the past 26 months, with debt repayments of $430 million in 2010, $265 million in 2011, and as described in the subsequent event note in our recently filed Form 10-K, almost $800 million in the first 2 months of this year. We continue to evaluate our capital structure. And with net debt at year end of only $2.5 billion and a liquid marketable securities portfolio with approximately $1.5 billion at year end, we have significant flexibility to add long-term debt without impacting our current investment-grade ratings, especially in light of the current favorable interest rate environment. ","Turning briefly to the fourth quarter, production and costs were largely in line with our expectations although, as you will no doubt have seen, we took a $1.6 billion after-tax impairment in regard to the Hope Bay project, which I will cover in more detail shortly. Adjusted net income of $1.17 a share was roughly $0.10 short of consensus, of which $0.07 can be explained by an increase in concentrate inventory on hand at Boddington in Australia due to some shipping constraints in late December. This increase was simply a timing difference, and that inventory was sold early in the first quarter. This is a long-term business, and quarterly inventory fluctuations of up to 50,000 ounces aren't uncommon for us, especially at operations where we are shipping concentrate as opposed to dor\u00e9. ","In addition, the spending on exploration and advanced projects was back-end weighted, and we played a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter, and that's reflected in our earnings per share. We also realized $1,670 an ounce versus, I think, the LME average for the quarter of $1,683. Almost all of this is attributable to the pricing of our concentrate sales shipments, which effectively price over a rolling 3-month period from shipment as opposed to dor\u00e9, which essentially prices overnight. ","Moving to Slide 6. You'll see that our operating performance for 2011 was in line with our original outlook from last February. Attributable gold production of 5.2 million ounces was right in the middle of our range, although down by 4% from a year ago due to less Phase 5 ore mined at Batu Hijau, resulting in the treatment of lower-grade stockpiles and also lower leach ore placement at Yanacocha. This was partially offset by higher production at North America and Ghana in Africa. ","Gold cost applicable to sales of $591 an ounce was $1 above the high end of our original outlook, and I will go into that in a little more detail on the following slide. Attributable copper production was on target, although down significant from last year at Batu Hijau for the reasons discussed previously. Copper production at Boddington increased 21% over 2011. Copper CAS of $1.26 a pound was at the low end of our original outlook, resulting largely from the relative outperformance of gold versus copper and the corresponding lower allocation of operating costs to copper revenue. Copper CAS was up substantially from 2010 in light of the Phase 6 stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which will continue until the end of 2013. ","Slide 7 provides more detail on cost applicable to sales on a per-ounce basis for 2011 through a waterfall from the original budget of $572 an ounce to the reported $591 an ounce. As reflected on the chart, the stronger Australian dollar added $18 an ounce, although this was offset by $9 an ounce in Aussie dollar currency hedge gains. The relative outperformance of gold over copper added $11 an ounce to our gold CAS due to coproduct accounting for costs at Boddington and Batu Hijau. ","The higher-than-budgeted realized gold price added $7 an ounce in higher royalties and workers participation. As I've commented on previous calls, we're more than happy to pay these incremental costs, given the significant related margin expansion. On the positive side of the equation, higher by-product credits, primarily  silver for us, reduced CAS by $8 an ounce, and a reallocation of certain mining-related taxes from CAS to the income tax expense line reduced CAS by a further $7 an ounce. ","Adjusting our reported CAS solely for the impact of the stronger relative performance of gold over copper and higher-than-budgeted gold price resulted in adjusted cost applicable to sales of $573 an ounce, just below the midpoint of our original outlook from a year ago. It should also be borne in mind that our costs are reported under U.S. GAAP, which generally adds between $20 and $50 an ounce to similar costs calculated under IFRS, due to the different accounting treatment for deferred stripping and stockpiles in particular. ","Looking at the table on the right on Slide 7, net income for the year of $366 million was impacted by the following: a non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of $2.1 billion on a pretax basis, or $1.6 billion on an after-tax basis, related to our Hope Bay project in Canada. We made a decision in January to place Hope Bay on care and maintenance after evaluating numerous development options against other opportunities in our portfolio. At the end of the day, our desire to generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted-average cost of capital versus simply producing ounces for ounces' sake drove us to put the project in care and maintenance and reallocate capital to higher-returning projects in the portfolio. The write-down had no effect on cash flow or reserves, and Hope Bay was not included in the company's 2017 strategic growth plan outlined in April last year or in our capital expenditure outlook for 2012 announced in January. ","The other impairments of $105 million were primarily related to a  third quarter charge for Paladin and Pilot Gold marketable securities acquired as part of the Fronteer acquisition; favorable tax planning opportunities which, by definition, are hard to predict added $65 million to the bottom line; and the loss from discontinued operations that arose during the fourth quarter on a royalty dispute relating to St. Andrew Goldfields. Taking the above into account, we reported adjusted net income for 2011 of roughly $4.40 a share. ","Turning briefly to our 2012 outlook for CAS, which we announced in January. Slide 8 breaks down the 10% increase year-over-year by region and cost driver. In addition to industry-wide inflation pressures, I would just note the following: the increase in Asia Pacific costs reflects the higher allocation of cost to gold through by-product accounting; higher wage rates in Aussie dollar terms; the recently approved carbon tax that goes into effect on July 1, 2012; and a higher Australian dollar assumption. Looking at cost drivers, labor cost increases and consumable cost increases for fuels and bulks drove most of that increase. ","Moving to Slide 9. As we announced on Wednesday, the board approved the declaration of a first quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on March 29 to shareholders of record on March 15. This dividend represents an increase of 133% from a year ago, is in line with our gold price-linked dividend policy, reflecting a fourth quarter average realized gold price of $1,670 an ounce. Based on a $64 share price, this represents an industry-leading annualized yield of 2.2%, higher than the current year on the S&P 500, the yield on the 10-year Treasury and almost 260 basis points higher than the gold ETF. ","And finally, we continue to believe that at the end of the day, per-share metrics matter in this business. And in particular, we think that the full metrics depicted on Slide 10 are key determinants of long-term value creation for shareholders in the gold business. As we look at opportunities to put our shareholders' capital to work either in our own portfolio or externally, these metrics remain front and center in our minds. ","I will now call -- turn the call over to Gary for his perspective on our regional operating results.","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks, Russell. I'm really excited to be here. I've been following Richard and the team and the direction that Newmont's been taking, and I was attracted by Newmont's good reputation, focus on sustainable development and value creation. It's been a very busy last 3 months. I visited most of the operations and most of the major projects across the globe, and we've got fantastic assets, great people and some good opportunity across the group. I bring a passion for safety, which is shared across the business. ","Despite this good focus, we did, unfortunately, have 5 people from our workforce and contractors lose their life in 2011 and clearly, this is not acceptable. I'll be working with the team to accelerate our safety improvement efforts going forward in 2012. ","On Slide 11. Comparing Newmont's production and cost profile from 2010 to 2011, the power of the portfolio is evident. As Russell mentioned earlier, while year-over-year production was down about 4%, results were in line with our outlook as production from North America and Africa offset anticipated declines in South America and Asia Pacific. ","From a cost standpoint, the largest impacts were also felt in our South America and Asia Pacific regions. Again, this performance was anticipated and included in our outlook as we expected lower production in both of these regions. And in particular, we expected Asia Pacific's cost to reflect the processing of stockpiled ore at Batu Hijau as we transition from mining and processing Phase 5 ore in 2010 to stripping Phase 6 and processing lower-grade stockpiles in 2012 and 2013. ","For a detailed discussion of mine-by-mine performance, please see yesterday's release and 10-K. For this morning's call, I'd like to focus my regional remarks on key drivers of production and cost in 2011. ","Turning to Slide 12. Our North American 2011 production was up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo, as well as the completion of slope remediation work at Gold Quarry, which is partially offset by lower production from our underground mine, Chukar. Gold CAS was higher due to higher surface mining and milling costs, partially offset by higher silver by-product credits. ","In 2012, priorities in Nevada include the Leeville ventilation shaft repair work, which we expect to complete in the first half of this year. I'd also like to point out that our outlook for the year at Nevada of 1.7 million to 1.8 million ounces of production includes the expectation of seasonal downtime in the second quarter as a result of planned maintenance on our roster, as was the case in 2011. ","Moving to Slide 13. Our South American region successfully met outlook despite roadblock activity that temporarily affected access to our Yanacocha mine during the fourth quarter. Gold production for the year was lower at Yanacocha relative to 2010 due to lower leach pad ore placement and partially offset by higher grades and recoveries. Gold CAS was higher due to lower production, higher mining costs and lower silver by-product credits. ","Turning now to our Asia Pacific region on Slide 14. The year-over-year comparisons reflect the impact of the stripping campaign at Batu Hijau, which is expected to continue through the end of 2013. As a result, both gold and copper production were lower than a year ago for the region, partially offset by higher mill throughput and higher copper grade at Boddington. Both gold and copper CAS were higher due to the lower production, higher waste mining and higher labor and commodity costs. ","Turning to Slide 15. To shed a little additional light on Batu Hijau, the Phase 6 stripping campaign is expected to conclude in late 2013, and we expect to be back in the higher grade ores in 2014. In the picture you can see on the left, which was just taken last week, we're looking towards the south, and you can see the wider areas in both the south and back towards you in the north. That's the stripping that's going on and its relative position to the rest of the pit. We're up at the top, and we'll be working our way down over the next couple of years to uncover the higher-grade ore in the bottom of the pit. ","I'll conclude the regional discussion on Slide 16 with Africa. Ahafo's contribution to the portfolio was greater than the prior year due to the addition of material from the Amoma pit. Fourth quarter 2011 gold production was lower than a year ago due to lower mill grade and increased inventory. Gold CAS in 2011 was higher due to higher labor, commodity and royalty costs, and was partially offset by higher production. ","I'd like to now turn the call over to Guy to discuss our exploration results.","Guy Lansdown","Thank you, Gary, and good day. Here on Slide 17, we've summarized our 2011 gold exploration results. We are really excited to have added about 12 million ounces in 2011 to achieve a record gold proven and probable reserve base of around 99 million ounces, a net increase of about 6% over last year. In addition, we grew our gold NRM by about 12% in 2011, while increasing gold in our earlier-stage resource categories. To deliver these results, we employed 125 drill rigs and drilled approximately 1.3 million meters to deliver our fourth consecutive year of reserve increases for gold and copper. ","2012 exploration priorities include Long Canyon, Leeville, Carlin, Mike, Phoenix and Fiberline in Nevada. Supporting the development of a new district in the Guiana Shield in South America, we are conducting extensive development infill drilling at the Merian project in Suriname, with the aim of adding reserves in 2012 -- of adding NRM in 2012. Follow-up drill programs at the nearby Sabajo project are coming up with promising results. ","In the Asia Pacific region, we plan to build on our 2011 success at the Callie underground mine in the Tanami and at KCGM operations, while Jundee and Waihi drill programs should continue to add new underground mine life from surface and underground drill programs. Each of these sites have great exploration potential that we plan to continue aggressively testing in 2012. ","Meanwhile, in Africa, drill programs successfully expanded the wingspan of early-stage Subika underground mineralization, and we began drilling extensions of the Apensu open pits. Early-stage activity around Ahafo North demonstrated potential for additional open pit and underground mineralization near the existing reserve. Drill programs at Akyem suggest potential for underground mineralization. We will continue with these programs in 2012 as we expand our exploration efforts in Ghana. ","Over the last 10 years, we have been a leader among our peers by delivering 85 million ounces of reserves through organic growth alone at a very competitive total unit reserves cost, including ore exploration costs of approximately $25 per ounce, which more than offset 75 million ounces of depletion. ","On Slide 18, we had similar success with our copper exploration efforts, boosting total reserves by 600 million pounds before depletion to a record of nearly 10 billion pounds, an increase of about 3% over last year. In addition, we grew our copper NRM by about 11% in 2011. 2012 exploration efforts will focus on copper targets in the earlier stages of our pipeline at Elang and Copper Basin in Nevada. ","Turning to Slide 19. We have only had our Long Canyon project for about a year, and we are very encouraged at the progress that we have made to-date. In 2011, our aggressive 59-kilometer drilling program resulted in an extension of the known mineralization by about 25%. As you can see from the section on the lower half of the slide, we have encouraging grade and thicker mineralization that supports our original thesis at the time of acquisition. For 2012, we plan to conduct over 70 kilometers of infill, expansion and district exploration drilling that should form the basis to declare our first NRM at Long Canyon in 2012. ","From a development standpoint, we are on track to submit our plan of operations in the first quarter of 2012. Slide 20 summarizes our 3 major projects, which are currently in execution and were approved by our Board of Directors last year. ","Our Akyem team is making great progress. The engineering is essentially complete and overall progress is on track at about 30%, with civil and concrete works well underway and structural steel work commencing in January. Construction activities remain suspended at Conga while we await the completion of the EIA  review. Engineering continues and is approximately 85% complete. All major equipment has been ordered, and the team is currently developing plans for restarting construction activities. At Tanami, engineering is progressing and main construction contracts are about to be awarded, while the shaft pilot hole drilling is in progress. ","Now I'll turn it over to Richard for his concluding remarks.","Richard T. O'Brien","Thanks, Guy. I'll conclude by reiterating our commitment to delivering shareholder value through execution on the 5 components of our strategy. We will pursue growth but not growth at any cost, and it will be growth that delivers competitive returns. Our 2011 performance affirms that Newmont will continue to execute on its operating base, continue to realize its exploration potential and continue to build competitive projects that deliver competitive returns. ","And finally, by maintaining a strong balance sheet and generating robust operating cash flows, we will remain a unique investment platform because we can return capital to shareholders while providing competitive growth, delivering ounces which produce current cash flow and allow us to continue to drive the business forward, both for today and for the future. So combined,  these components provide a powerful and compelling value proposition that we believe truly differentiate this company and position us for the future. ","So with that, we'll be happy to take your questions and thanks for listening.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question from John Bridges, JPMorgan.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wondered, the cash has gone down this year. You've got this commitment to a dividend now, which is obviously working very well for you. I just wondered if Russ was going to duck into his piggy bank to maintain it going forward.","Russell D. Ball","John, it's Russ. Yes, the cash was down. And I'd just like to remind people, we did pay cash for the Fronteer acquisition in April, $2.2 billion, because we didn't want to dilute our shareholders, knowing this was a long-term exploration plan. And as I mentioned earlier, we have deleveraged the balance sheet significantly over the last couple of years. And in today's interest rate environment, we are looking at an opportunity to answer at some [ph] long-term debt. And we are pretty conservatively geared, if you look at the financial metrics, and have plenty of flexibility. But you've seen the cash flow generation capacity of the existing assets. And in this gold price environment, we're blessed with that attribute. As Richard said, strong balance sheet, strong operating cash flows, we can fund the growth, the dividend and continue the investment in exploration off of our current business plans. So a great position to be in, John.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so you're confident and that's nice to hear. And then maybe an operating question. It's probably a bit unfair given your short tenure there, but Boddington is on a run rate for 800,000 ounces a year. Could you talk a little bit about the progress with fixing up the plant and what you think it's capable of now?","Gary J. Goldberg","Gary here. John, the guidance is for 750,000, just to be clear, looking out for the next couple of years. And having visited there just 1.5 weeks ago, the work that's been done to upgrade and improve the conveyors, which was one of the bottlenecks that we had, is going to be completed later this quarter. And the team there and the work that's been done all looks in line to be able to achieve the 750,000 guidance that we've given.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Did you say -- I thought it was 750,000 to 800,000?","Gary J. Goldberg","I'm sorry. 750,000 to 800,000.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. Okay, cool. And if I might slip one last little one in, maybe. I see you've got a big inferred number there for Yanacocha now. Is that the sulfides that are beginning to come into play?","Guy Lansdown","John, this is Guy. Yes, I believe that's where the bulk of the inferred material will be coming in.","Operator","Next question from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jorge with Deutsche Bank. I guess my first question is for Richard. Again, just following up on the Conga update that you gave us. What is the next key date as to when you expect that sign-off from the committee on the EIS?","Richard T. O'Brien","So Jorge, what we've been told is that from the time that the committee began its work was going to be 40 days for them to conclude their work. What we don't know is, at the time when that comes out, how long the government is going to want to review that outcome and when we'll find that out. So I would expect it's going to be at least 40 days from the time period when that was announced. We're hopeful that it's not an extended period beyond that 40 days, but we don't really know. So in the meantime, we continue to work at the site with the government just to ensure that things are maintained throughout the wet period as best we can. We continue to work on engineering and we continue to keep our project team together, while at the same time, Ramzi and Guy have worked hard to reduce current costs at Conga. So I think the best that we can do at this point is do everything we can to be flexible, be ready to go and be responsive to the government when the results of that EIA review come out.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. But some of the nature of the opposition to the project seems to be grassroots and related to -- I mean, could there be a worse-case scenario where you do get a clean bill of health on the EIS and the government signs off quickly, but then there's still another local round of opposition?","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes, so remember, I'm the CEO of a mining company. I'm not a politician, so what I have to say is just from my standpoint. But the Conga Project, I believe, is a well positioned, well studied project with a well-thought-out and, I believe, well planned EIA. I think we are doing everything we can to ensure that, that project moves forward. What happens in Peru, I really can't tell you what's going to happen in Peru. All I can tell you is that the president has spoken about the government support for Conga. And as you point out, there are regional politicians who have been opposed to Conga. How they settle that dispute, I don't know. All I can tell you is we commit that around the communities most closely to Conga, we're working very closely with those people. We want to embrace the fact that if there are reasonable changes that need to be made, we will make those, to make sure that we try as best we can to respond to any community concerns. We can't settle political disputes, but we will work hard to do everything in our power to make this go forward.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And if I can just squeeze a second quick question in to Guy. Just at Long Canyon, you said you'll have an NRM by the end of this year. Could you just kind of update us as to what you're looking at in terms of a conceptual resource size there at this point?","Guy Lansdown","If you'll recall, the target case was of the order of 2 million ounces. And we're obviously hoping to achieve as much of that as we can. We still got drilling underway. We still got steady work underway. We still got modeling we've got to do, but that's what we will be targeting.","Operator","Our next question from Patrick Chidley, HSBC.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on Long Canyon. Guy, did you say 2 million ounces or 10 million ounces?","Guy Lansdown","I wish it was 10 million ounces, Patrick. Sorry, the targets that we hedged at the time of doing the acquisition, the base case was 2 million ounces. The drilling work that we've done, the study work that we've done, that we will undertake, we'll be targeting 2 million ounces -- up to 2 million ounces for conversion to NRM later this year. So that is 2 million ounces.","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes, just to be clear on that, Patrick, what Guy said is 2 million ounces for NRM. That was the original plan that we saw at the time of acquisition. We also mentioned, though, that we saw a considerable upside over time. And at the time, we talked about the potential for up to 8 million ounces. What Guy is saying is not all of that is going to come in this year. We're going to continue that drilling program, and this is step one and in Phase 1 of what we expect to be a long-term development option here, which will provide us with considerable upside. That's what we said at the time of the acquisition. We still believe that, through all the exploration results we have today.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","All right. But Fronteer had already outlined 2.3 million ounces, I think. Is that in addition to the 2 million ounces, you mean?","Guy Lansdown","No, Pat, that's just 2 million ounces total of NRM that we'd be looking at bringing in. The numbers that were around or of the order of 2 million, I think, the Fronteer number was 2.3 million. We saw...","Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","So it would be a confirmation of their numbers?","Guy Lansdown","Yes, that's correct.","Randy Engel","Patrick, it's Randy. I think that's absolutely what we're trying to say, the confirmation in the year 2012 of what was originally in the Fronteer numbers. And then, as Richard pointed out, we -- when we made the acquisition, we had anticipated considerably greater than that total amount over time. But what our question was trying to address was what we expect in 2012.","Richard T. O'Brien","So basically trying to take what was a potential resource that was working for Fronteer, and they had not yet declared yet to NRM a higher standard of potential definition throughout 2011. And the work we're doing in 2012, bring what they had as a hope to the reality of NRM, and we're doing that throughout 2012. And then we'll continue to bring that into reserve, as well as bring what we see as potential resource into NRM in future years. And with that, we still have the full expectation that we'll see 8 million ounces. That's what we see today. It's still early days, but confirmatory drilling continues to keep that right in front of us. So I'd say the acquisition case is good or better than what we had in place at the time.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","And then just a follow-ups also on your exploration programs. Can you outline what work went on last year in Nevada at Mike and Fiberline and the Greater Gold Quarry, and how that might play out this year?","Guy Lansdown","Yes, Patrick, what I'm going to do is ask Grigore Simon, our Vice President of Exploration, to talk a bit about that. And I did want him to address the question from John Bridges earlier around the inferred material at Yanacocha.","Grigore Simon","So I am going to address first John's question then. Most of the inferred material that the question referred to is coming from Conga, to be precise. To follow up on the question on Long Canyon, Patrick, that you had and the rest of Nevada, at Long Canyon, I think, you got the message that we are confident that we will deliver on the target case that we mentioned and look at this NRM as the very first step to get there. Going to Mike and Fiberline, what we have done is, we are still in the scoping study there, so we have done quite a lot of drilling in preparation for moving and advancing actually these ounces to an NRM category. So the programs remain on track. We are spending money on both, and we are dealing them both. And they look actually quite good. As far as Gold Quarry is concerned, Gold Quarry is going to deliver ounces for years to come. Just to give you an example, in the reserves program this year, Gold Quarry had the significant contribution again. It's almost 800,000 ounces just from pit expansions. If you look into the NRM, again, Gold Quarry came with significant ounces as part of the Phase 8. We expect to bring more reserves next year. So I will say that overall, all Nevada programs actually are very vibrant.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","Very good. I hope to continue to hear more about those programs through the year and what the progress is toward that scoping study on Mike, in particular. And then one final thing, I just wanted to ask if -- is the appropriate strip ratios for the new reserves, is that available in the 10-Q? Or if not, will you provide it, please?","Russell D. Ball","Yes, it's in the reserve -- Patrick, it's Russ. It's in the reserve table in the 10-K. You can see the ore and the recovery and the strip ratio.","Operator","Next question from Mike Jalonen with Bank of America.","Michael Jalonen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, not to beat a dead horse, just on Long Canyon, Guy, what's the strike extent that you'll have there for that 2 million ounce target? And then a second question I'll have, what's the long-term plan for Hope Bay? Is that going to be vented out eventually?","Guy Lansdown","Let me talk about Hope Bay, while Grigore sorts through the extension question. At Hope Bay, what we're doing right now is putting it on care and maintenance, working with the local community and the government. And while we have some other potential options, we're not ready to talk about them at this time. What I would say, Mike, is that it's clear that there is gold at Hope Bay. How to recover it in an economic project is something that we believe, over time, could happen, and we'll continue to hold that possibility for us. As Russ said, though, to be precise where we are today, it's not in our development project pipeline. And with that, then we've taken off the amounts on the books so that we have some flexibility going forward, and we'll keep you posted as to what we do. So Grigore?","Grigore Simon","Thank you, Richard. The current footprint of the mineralization at Long Canyon is somewhere in the range of 800 meters to 1,000 meters. And as you -- as we have already mentioned, we managed to extend the footprint of that mineralization overall by about 25%. So to give you a sense in meters, it's about 450 meters extension to the north. And to the south, actually we are adding again about a few hundred meters. But please keep in mind that we are still early stage here. We have been there for almost a year now, and we really try to confirm the resource first before we were actually able to do any expansion drilling. At the same time, as you are probably aware, we had some permit limitations there in terms of the amount of exploration that we can do in the district, pending the extensions. Now we have secured these permits last year, and we expect this year to show much more district exploration.","Richard T. O'Brien","And just to build on that, one way to look at the confidence we have in the Hope Bay or -- sorry, in Long Canyon, is that we've actually -- as Guy said, we're getting ready to file our plan of operations. We've moved that up in our time frame by about 3 to 6 months, and that plan of operations is the first step in getting our permit to actually mine there. So we're actually moving very quickly to put this into both operations, while we continue to explore in the district. And what that says is that we're confident that we have enough material through our existing exploration program to go put a plan of operation in place, to get ready to permit that while at the same time, as Grigore said, moving outside, looking at extensions and seeing how far it goes. So I think what you can read into that is that we're pretty, pretty positive about where things stand at Long Canyon.","Russell D. Ball","Patrick, it's Russ. I just wanted to go back and correct. We have the tons -- ore tons and recovery. I'll ask John's group and I'll work with them to get the strip ratios up, and we'll put it on the website so that people can go in there and model it, to the best of our knowledge anyway.","Operator","Our next question from Paretosh Misra, Morgan Stanley.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you mentioned capital discipline as a central part of your strategy. So could putting some sort of maximum limit on CapEx be also considered?","Russell D. Ball","Sorry, I think the question was, would we consider putting a maximum limit on CapEx? And we consider, obviously, our ability to fund ongoing exploration. And capital does come in 2 forms in the sense of new projects, expansion capital and also sustaining capital. And we balance that investment with our expectations around gold price and the balance sheet strength. I'll say that if a project is delivering strong economic returns, we will find a way to fund it. Probably more of an issue for us, quite frankly, in this environment is finding the human capital to build it. So the balance sheet is obviously something we do spend a lot of time looking at. But in this positive environment, we can fund a number of projects. Getting the people and keeping the people to fund and to build those projects is probably the biggest challenge right now.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. And then maybe just one more. How much of this Conga CapEx you will need to spend, should you decide to not proceed with the project this year?","Richard T. O'Brien","If we don't get the positive nod from the EIA, we have probably $600 million of capital right now that's planned, and I think we'll look at every dollar of that if we don't proceed with this, this year. There will be some ongoing remediation at the site when the dry season comes on us and we'll continue to work through that, but that will be a small portion of that capital. So we'll just keep you apprised as we see, going forward. In the meantime, we'll complete engineering. That's the only thing we really have planned at the moment as we were already demobilizing a lot of the other equipment at the site, preparing to come back when we hear about the EIA, so trying to minimize those costs but be ready to go. As I said, be flexible, be ready to go.","Operator","Our next question from Dave Hove, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Dave Hove - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Richard, just wanted to ask you, recently, we've seen on the news on Ghana that they're starting to review stabilization agreements. And also in Indonesia, that they are -- that in Indonesia that they're going to start to review your contract of work. What sort of impact do you think it would have on Newmont?","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes, it's a great question. And what I would say is that we have really been on notification in both countries for some time that the governments want to renegotiate. In both countries, we have -- in the one, Ghana, we have a parliamentarily approved, if that's such a word, stabilization agreement. And in the other, Indonesia, we have a contract to work. And we have indicated to both governments that, of course, we'll be flexible within reason. And that while renegotiation from their standpoint might look like higher royalties or higher taxes, that there are other components of a renegotiation, which are things on our side that allow us to do things that we need to do as well. So what I would say is the impact on Newmont at the present time, we could expect that a higher royalty might take place in both of those countries, or taxes. But I would expect that on balance, it will not be material to the company, and that as we find anything out in those -- which have both been on the table for some time and we have not seen any conclusions on either one, so I can't really give you a precise number because we don't have one. But what I can tell you is when we do, we'll let you know. We just want to make sure that people know that in this environment -- and you see it across the world. It's not just Newmont, it's not just Ghana. I think that governments and communities are demanding their fair share of mining projects, particularly in this bull market environment that we've seen over the last couple of years. I think that we have to be responsive. We have to be responsible, but what that means is that we have to be responsible to all stakeholders. It's not just about what communities want or the government wants or what our shareholders need. It's a combination to make sure that we can continue to sustain the business, and that's the way we address these negotiations. We have certain rights, but we also have certain obligations in every one of these countries.","Dave Hove - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. And as a follow-up question on that, you saw that Elang is one of the projects which you talked about obviously [ph] . And with Indonesia planning on banning the exporting of unprocessed ore in 2014, they say, so what are the impacts on your plans with Elang based on that?","Richard T. O'Brien","That's also a good question. And again, I would suggest to you that my recent discussions with the government of Indonesia, prior discussions, I think Indonesia is trying to ensure, like a lot of countries, that they get the most out of not just the mining but also the mining and beneficiation of the resources owned by the country. How to get the most out of that, I think, is still to come. And while that certainly is a law that the Indonesians have proposed, I think they are still working through, and we're trying to help them work through, what the exact impact of that is. And I would tell you this, that if we go forward with Elang, we're going to have to do so along with the Indonesian government, because we're going to need to get permits. And we will work with them closely to ensure that what we want to do, putting money in the ground for Elang, putting money on top of the ground for processing and equipment, combining that with our Batu Hijau operations -- before we invest significant capital in that kind of project, we are going to ensure that we have the right arrangement that will allow us, the government and the communities to all benefit from our activities going forward. And we don't have all of that in place today, nor would I suggest to you does the government. So what I would say is, while they want to continue to have foreign direct investment in Indonesia -- they have to have that to support their growth, I don't think they have the exact formula. They have pieces of what they want, but they're going to have to work with us to make sure that those pieces comport with what we need. So at this point, what I'd tell you is, we have good exploration potential in front of us. We have some negotiations in front of us, and we'll see how things come out.","Operator","Our last question from John Tumazos, Independent Research.","John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","I may be confused by some reports in the press, and forgive me for expressing the concern. I believe it was Mineweb that reported that part of the negotiation for Conga was a commitment that Newmont would guarantee a minimum of $2 billion in tax revenues. Was that report correct? And if you have to guarantee a certain threshold of tax payments before you earn the money, under U.S. accounting, would that show up on commitments and contingencies on the balance sheet?","Richard T. O'Brien","Let me take that, John. I'll start with the second question, which is we didn't commit to anything, so we're not going to report anything. I don't know what the standard is. But I'm pretty sure if we committed it, we would have to disclose that kind of contingency. But there's no way, if there was such a report, that, that's true. Obviously, we will pay the taxes that are due when they're due, and we'll pay them under the current regulations or how they change over time. But there are no minimums that we would commit to, nor have we committed to anything. So sorry you read that, but it didn't come from us.","John Charles Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research, LLC","If I could follow up. In addition to the NGOs, a particular issue -- and your guys have been working there 20 years, they're well aware, some of the indigenous people in northern Peru don't accept the government in Lima as legitimate. Now they think they were there before Pizarro. So if you encounter these local issues like roadblocks, et cetera, how do you work around the diversity of political opinion in the country?","Richard T. O'Brien","Well, as I said, John, I think that we're not politicians, but what we are is we have a lot of relations with people in the community. We have been working in that community since really early exploration activities took place in Conga, probably 10 years ago. As a result of that, we do try to stay plugged into what's important to those people. It's an agrarian community. As you point out, there's a lot of history there. I think the roadblocks come from a number of different parameters. They come from politicians. They come from local citizens who are concerned about water and jobs. And I think with respect to each of those categories, we provide what we provide, which is we provide a resource base. We can develop it. We can put people to work. We can provide taxes. And in this case, we can take water, which at the moment is not consumable, and we can turn it into something which is and which is more sustainable over time and which is more predictable, less seasonal. So I think we can provide what the community needs. And how politicians and others accept that is up to them. We can only do what we can do. ","Well, with that, John, thanks for your questions, and thanks to everybody else for your attendance on the call. We really appreciate your attendance and interest, and thanks for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jessica Largent","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, President and Chief Operating Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team.","Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmontgoldcorp.com.","Now, I'll hand it over to Gary on Slide 3.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Jess, and thank you all, for joining our call. Newmont delivered solid first quarter results as we continue to execute our strategy which includes delivering superior operational execution by running our mine safely and efficiently, sustaining a global portfolio of long life assets by advancing profitable expansions and exploration on four continents and leading the gold sector in profitability and responsibility.","Turning to the details on Slide 4; in the first quarter, Newmont again delivered superior operational execution which we demonstrated by producing over 1.2 million ounces of attributable gold production at all-in sustaining cost of $907 per ounce. Pouring our 10 millionth ounce at Tanami since mining began in 1986 and forging an agreement with Barrick to create a joint venture in Nevada by combining our operations to unlock synergies and new opportunities for our employees and stakeholders. We also continue to strengthen our portfolio in the first quarter. We commissioned the Tanami power project safely and on-schedule, lowering power cost and carbon emissions by 20% and paving the way for a second expansion of this world-class asset in Australia.","We invested in profitable growth through the Ahafo mill expansion and Quecher Main projects, which are expected to reach commercial production later this year. We progressed studies for future opportunities across our portfolio including Tanami Expansion 2 and Yanacocha Sulfides which continue to advance towards full-funding decisions. And we announced and last week closed our acquisition of Goldcorp, which I'll discuss in more detail later.","Finally, we delivered leading financial performance in the first quarter by generating adjusted EBITDA of $687 million and free cash flow of $349 million, maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector, supported by an investment-grade credit profile, returning cash to shareholders through an industry leading quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share and a special dividend of $0.88 per share. We also continued to fulfill our commitments to leading environmental, social and governance performance by upholding human rights, serving as a responsible natural resource stewards and applying lessons to reduce risks and improve health and safety for the benefit of all employees and stakeholders. I invite you to read more about our performance, programs and targets as well as areas we can continue to improve on and beyond the mine, our annual sustainability report which is available on our website. ","Turning to more about sustainability on Slide 5. We began the year with the total recordable injury frequency rate of 0.52, a step back from our 2018 performance and a reminder that we need to remain vigilant in reinforcing key safety systems and behaviors among our employees and contractors throughout our business. Earlier this month mark the anniversary of the tragic loss of our six colleagues at the Ahafo Mill Expansion Project in Ghana. Although a year has passed, the void in the lives of their families and friends remain as their memories live on. We learned critical lessons from the thorough investigation conducted after the accident. These lessons have been applied at our operations and have been shared across the mining industry.","Creating a more responsible and sustainable business is a continuous journey. The tragic failure of Vale's Brumadinho tailings facility in Brazil earlier this year highlighted the need for the industry to improve its management of these facilities. Newmont continues to review and improve our existing practices. To improve awareness of our facilities, we published a tailings fact sheet which can be found on our website.","We have 26 tailings facilities in which we safely place more than 100 million tons of tailings every year, guided by strict standards for managing and expecting our facilities. We also actively support raising standards for tailings management across the mining industry, similar to how we've been able to raise our standards on cyanide management. We are committed to protecting the health and well-being of people and the environment.","Turning to Slide 6. In January, we announced our intent to combine with Goldcorp and just last week, we closed the transaction after receiving all the regulatory and shareholder approvals. Newmont Goldcorp is the world's leading gold business with the strongest portfolio of operating gold mines, projects and reserves in favorable mining jurisdictions. Underpinned by a proven and scalable operating model, we'll target six to seven million ounces per year sustainable gold production and we expect to enhance annual revenues by another $1.5 billion through silver, zinc and copper production. We will have the financial flexibility needed to execute our capital priorities, delivering industry-leading dividend and maintaining investment-grade balance sheet. We have a deep bench of accomplished business leaders and high performing technical teams with extensive mining industry experience and we will maintain industry-leadership in environmental, social and governance performance.","Beyond great assets, prospects and people, our value proposition is supported by our proven strategy and track record. We expect to generate $365 million in annual pre-tax savings through G&A synergies, supply chain efficiencies and full potential improvements. Taken together, these efforts hold the potential to deliver total value creation of $4.4 billion. We also expect to unlock further upside through portfolio optimization, project sequencing, exploration and divestments. As a result, Newmont Goldcorp is set to deliver stable-free cash flow from steady production and improving cost over a decade-long time horizon.","Turning to our global portfolio on Slide 7. Newmont Goldcorp's industry-leading portfolio is based in four regions where we have the stability and proven operating model to create value. With the additional assets in Canada, Argentina and Mexico, and the Pueblo Viejo joint venture in the Dominican Republic, we now have the strongest portfolio of operating mines in favorable jurisdictions, with 90% of the reserves based in the Americas and Australia.","Turning to our projects on Slide 8. Newmont Goldcorp has a robust project pipeline, creating a foundation for steady production and cash flow for decades to come. This pipeline gives us significant flexibility and we will continue to advance only those projects that meet our minimum hurdle rate of 15% at a $1,200 gold price. The depth of this pipeline also allows us to optimize and sequence projects to ensure that capital is deployed effectively and efficiently based on value and risk. This is the same approach we have taken to successfully deliver 11 projects on four continents on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget over the last six years.","Turning to our production profile on Slide 9. Here is a look at Newmont Goldcorp's production through 2025. We are well-positioned for the longer term and over the next seven years, the combined portfolio is capable of producing seven to eight million ounces of gold annually, with all-in sustaining cost declining from $945 per ounce in 2019, to $830 per ounce in 2025. I would emphasize that we are still targeting production of six to seven million ounces of gold annually and this outlook did not include the impact of potential divestitures or project optimization.","Turning to the Nevada joint venture on Slide 10. In March, we entered into an implementation agreement with Barrick to form a joint venture that will combine our mining operations, assets, reserves and talent in Nevada. We believe this arrangement will generate long term value for all of our stakeholders by unlocking synergies, allowing profitable production to continue well into the future and creating opportunities for employees and other stakeholders through our broader unified mining enterprise in Nevada.","Under the terms of the agreement, Barrick and Newmont Goldcorp will hold economic interests equal to 61.5% and 38.5% respectively. Barrick will operate the entity with overall management responsibility and will be subject to the supervision and direction of the joint venture's board which will be comprised of three individuals appointed by Barrick, along with Tom Palmer and myself.","Electively, both companies will have equal representation on the joint venture's technical, financial and exploration advisory committees. Our teams have been meeting regularly to facilitate a smooth transition upon closing and ensure a successful partnership into the future.","With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy on Slide 11 to discuss our financial performance.","Nancy Buese","Thanks, Gary. Turning to Slide 12 for the financial highlights. Compared to the prior year quarter, we delivered revenue of $1.8 billion, which was approximately flat despite lower gold price. Adjusted net income of $176 million or $0.33 per diluted share. An adjusted EBITDA of $687 million, an increase of 7%. Cash from continuing operations was $574 million and free cash flow is $349 million, primarily due to improvements in working capital.","Turning to Slide 13 for our review of earnings per share in more detail. First quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $113 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Primary adjustments included $0.11 related to transaction and integration cost from the Goldcorp acquisition and the Nevada joint venture. $0.04 related to valuation allowances and other tax impacts and $0.03 primarily related to a change in the fair value of our investments and minor restructuring charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share.","Turning now to Slide 14. We remain well-positioned to execute our capital priorities including maintaining an investment-grade credit profile, investing in the next generation of mines to improve margins and build a stronger reserve base and returning cash to shareholders. Newmont closed the first quarter with one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector and over the past month, we've executed a number of key financing activities. We declared a first quarter dividend of $0.14 per share and announced a special dividend of $0.88 per share. The special dividend will be paid on May 1 to Newmont shareholders on record as of April 17.","We reset our five-year $3 billion revolving credit facility, creating a strong banking syndicate and providing for a solid slate of future financing partners. We completed a successful exchange of Goldcorp notes to Newmont and streamlined our capital structure, and we paid off $1.25 billion of outstanding Goldcorp debt at closing.","Looking forward, 2019 will involve some complex reporting updates as we work to integrate Goldcorp and close the Nevada joint venture. In the second quarter, we will report consolidated Newmont Goldcorp financial results which will include Goldcorp's performance from the date of close. However, it's worth noting the guidance we provided in March assumed a full-year of Goldcorp production, costs and capital.","Impacts from the Nevada joint venture have yet to be fully determined, but once the transaction is completed, we will fortunately consolidate our ownership interests and report the entity as a separate segment in our financials. Despite the reporting changes you will see in 2019, Newmont Goldcorp is well-positioned to continue a trajectory of industry-leading financial performance by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long term value creation.","And now I'll hand it to Tom for the discussion of our operations starting on Slide 15.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, Nancy. Turning to North America on Slide 16. Our North American operations turned in a solid quarter. After coming off a very strong fourth quarter and overcoming near term challenges. At Carlin, we delivered steady performance and continued our remediation work at Gold Quarry. As previously stated, we forecast the impact of geotechnical issues on Carlin's production to be approximately 70,000 ounces in 2019. However, we expect to recover proportion of these ounces over the medium term and we plan to start mining Chukar underground at Gold Quarry again in June.","During the second quarter, Mill #6 will complete its annual planned maintenance shut for approximately three weeks in May. At CC&V, we completed a drawdown of stockpile concentrates for processing in Nevada and the running at more steady state production and inventory levels. And at Phoenix, we started to shift in the higher grade copper zones and away from higher grade gold zones in our mine sequence. Looking forward, we remain focused on continued execution and finalizing the Nevada joint venture with Barrick as we begin to generate additional value through combining our assets. We are also advancing our studies of CC&V underground and Galore Creek.","Turning to South America on Slide 17. At Yanacocha, we continued mining higher grades from Tapado Oeste pit. And at Merian, first quarter performance was impacted by wet weather, but continued improvements in mine and mill productivity helped to offset this. We have reached fresh rock and although we expect variability in the amount of saprolite we process, the primary crusher will help to sustain mill throughput over the course of 2019.","Quecher Main stripping continues on cause and the destruction of the leach pad is ongoing as we target commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019. Once complete, Yanacocha is expected to deliver approximately 200,000 ounces per year of consolidated production from 2020 to 2025 and serve as a bridge to developing the extensive sulfide deposits in the years ahead. Detailed engineering work for the sulfide project continues and in March we achieved a significant milestone, the approval of the overall projects environmental impact assessment. Two subsequent approvals will be required prior to reaching a full funds decision in 2020.","Turning to Australia on Slide 18. At Tanami, we delivered strong performance on the back of higher grades and sustained mill improvements. As Gary mentioned, Tanami reached an impressive milestone in March and I'd like to congratulate the team for pouring the operations' 10 millionth ounce. At Boddington, stripping in the south pit continues and we successfully completed the first of three planned mill maintenance shuts in 2019. KCGM continues to manage geotechnical challenges whilst we draw down stockpiles to help offset, reduced ex-pit [ph] mining. Mining in the Morrison starter pit is under way and we expect to reach higher grades in the second half of the year, helping to sustain operations as we work to optimize our longer term mine plans that will continue through the most of 2019. Looking forward, study work for Tanami Expansion 2 continues to advance towards a full funds decision later this year and shard [ph] sinking has progressed beyond 90 meters.","Turning to our latest investment on Slide 19. In March, the Tanami power project was commissioned safely and on schedule. The project included the installation of a 450-kilometer natural gas pipeline, two power stations and an interconnected power line. Transitioning the site from diesel to natural gas provides a reliable energy source, lowering power cost and carbon emissions by 20% while paving the way to further extend Tanami's mine life. And the project is expected to generate net cash savings of $34 per ounce in 2019 to 2023 and deliver an internal rate of return of greater than 50%. Tanami is Australia's second largest underground gold mine and we expect it to remain a cornerstone asset in the Newmont Goldcorp portfolio for decades to come.","Turning to Africa on Slide 20. The African region yet again delivered another strong quarter. At a time [ph], the mill continues to perform well on the back of sustained full potential improvements. And in the Ahafo, improved performance was driven by higher grades from both the Subika underground and open pit. The Ahafo mill expansion remains on-track to achieve commercial production in the fourth quarter and once completed will increase production, lower costs and extend mine life at Ahafo. We are reaching the peak construction work for some site and remain focused on safely completing the construction, the stockpile feed conveyor, SAG mill, primary crusher and ledge tanks.","In the second quarter, we expect to make a full funds decision for the ones that are laidback [ph], an extension of the current mining operations that will take open pit mine life at Ahafo through to 2029. Ahafo's performance is expected to continue improving throughout 2019 and now remain on track to deliver a record year. Finally, we continue to advance our original growth studies and are working to prioritize our many opportunities on a value versus risk basis.","Turning to Slide 21 for an update on the Goldcorp assets and our integration work. During the first quarter, Goldcorp operations performed as expected. With the board on [ph] project at Porcupine on schedule to achieve commercial production in the second half of 2019 and the Pyrite Leach Project running well with overall recoveries trending high in Pe\u00f1asquito. And at Red Lake, the Cochenour Project achieved commercial production on April 1 and is expected to contribute approximately 30,000 ounces in 2019.","We expect the back half way to 2019 for the Goldcorp assets driven by rich in higher grades of both Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerra Negro. However, recent events have created headwinds to achieving Goldcorp's previously forecasted production levels. At Musselwhite, our team is conducting a thorough investigation into the conveyor fire which occurred on March 29. We are also working to establish full access to the mine which is expected to occur over the next two months. As a result, the materials' handling project work is currently suspended and we'll provide additional updates on project timing and impacts to production as information becomes available.","At Pe\u00f1asquito, we're engaged in active dialog to successfully resolve an ongoing partial blockade of the site by group of local stakeholders. During this process, the site has maintained planned production levels through the mill and we expect minimal impacts to 2019 production, but overall mining rates have been reduced.","Turning to our integration efforts which are well under way. In March, we announced Newmont Goldcorp's executive leadership team, featuring accomplished mining leaders who are appointed based on a number of criteria including experience, team performance and values by its leadership. Most of the changes will take place over the coming months to allow for seamless transition process through the fourth quarter and I'll succeed Gary as President and Chief Executive Officer. Rob Atkinson will join us on June 1 as Chief Operating Officer, leading our operations and projects team which includes our four Regional Senior Vice Presidents. These four individuals were appointed based on their exceptional track records of leadership, project execution and commitment to safety and sustainability.","Todd White have previously served as Chief Operating Officer for Goldcorp will lead Newmont Goldcorp's new North America region with accountability for our four mines in Canada, CC&V in the U.S. and Pe\u00f1asquito Mexico. After three years successfully leading our Africa region, Alwyn Pretorius will move across to lead our South America region with accountability for the Cerro Negro, Merian and Yanacocha operations.","Ramzi Fawaz who is a 16-year veteran with Newmont and led the very successful turnaround of the Tanami mine in Australia from 2012 to 2019 and is currently leading our project development work in Australia has been promoted to replace Alwyn as Regional Senior Vice President of our Africa region, with accountability for Ahafo and [indiscernible] operations. And finally, Alex Bates, the Regional Senior Vice President of our Australia region was overseeing improvements are our Tanami, Boddington and KCGM operations will continue in his current capacity.","Now that we have appointed all of the senior leaders, the next step will be to launch our Full Potential continuous improvement program at our newly acquired Goldcorp assets. Starting at Pe\u00f1asquito in June and progressing to Sierra Negro and progressing to Cerro Negro and \u00c9l\u00e9onore over the second half of 2019. Full Potential will have a laser focus on the key value drivers for each location. However, we expect the greatest overall value potential to be in processing improvements which will concentrate on productivity, reliability and cost efficiency.","Our teams have been working diligently to begin delivering G&A savings or removing duplicationin the areas of labor and consulting services and we're also pursuing near-term supply chain efficiencies which include the initial consolidation of supply contracts and utilizing our scale to improve global purchasing power.","I'm very excited to have Newmont Goldcorp leadership team in place with highly capable people focused on generating long term value.","With that, I'll hand it back to Gary to wrap up on Slide 22.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 23, Newmont delivered solid first quarter results and laid the ground work for an even stronger future for Newmont Goldcorp. Our focus remains on generating long term value for our shareholders. We will do this by continuing to execute our strategy, which is to deliver superior operational excellence by focusing on safety and the culture of continuous improvement, sustain a global portfolio of long life assets by investing in the next generation of mines, technology and leaders across our business, and to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility by maintaining high standards and respectful relationships with all of our stakeholders.","Thank you for your time. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Fahad Tariq","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On Slide 21, you talked a little bit about Goldcorp. Because we don't have any operational results from Q1, can you give some more color on specifically Musselwhite with the underground fire and Cerra Negro, with the strike, how that impacted Q1 on production? And any other color you can give on Q1, that would be really helpful.","Tom Palmer","It's Tom here. For Pe\u00f1asquito, that hasn't had any impact on any Q1 production. We've been able to continue to run the mill as we work through that matter and the fire at Musselwhite occurred at the very end of the first quarter. It's still a fairly recent event that we're working through to understand what breadth [ph] is to come back in and remediate the areas that were damaged by the fire and do the rectification work, so it's still very early days there. But from a Q1 perspective, neither of those issues have an impact on Goldcorp's performance.","Fahad Tariq","Okay, thank you.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Fahad.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry","Hi, Gary, Tom, and Nancy. Few questions from me. The first one, just around the integration of the Goldcorp assets, how do you think about getting the right speed there where you can make changes but not I guess be too hasty? Will you start making changes at the asset level before giving the overall guidance? And then what is the timing that we should expect where you come out with revised estimates for the total company including the new Goldcorp assets? Thanks. That's my first question.","Gary Goldberg","I'll take the last question and then I'll hand the first question back over to Tom. In terms of guidance, the plan would be when we announced our second quarter results in July, we'd update the Newmont Goldcorp guidance. As a reminder, that wouldn't include changes that might be impacting guidance from the Nevada JV that we'll pick on board once that gets established moving forward. In terms of integration, a lot of work going on on the integration front and has been now for well over two months. And I'll hand over to Tom on the details of the work that's going on there.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, Chris. The six Goldcorp assets, in effect there's no change for those successes. The six general managers remain in place, will have father those assets report through to Todd White as our new North American Regional Senior Vice President, Tera Negar [ph] report through to Alwyn Pretorius, our new South America Regional Senior Vice President. But we expect those operations to continue to run under the leadership of those various general managers and regional senior vice presidents. We'll see Newmont's impact these as we come in and start to go through our rigorous application of our Full Potential program, which is a very structured process that takes place over a couple of months of diagnosis and setting up delivery plans. And then there's normally a 19-24 month delivery program coming out of that diagnostic work. We'll start in June at Pe\u00f1asquito, we'll move through to Cerra Negro and then through to [indiscernible] and I've had full potential up and running at three of the six sites before we complete this year.","Chris Terry","Okay, thanks, Tom. And then just on Slide 9, the overall production guidance of 6 million to 7 million ounces overall; that -- really, just to reiterate, that's the medium term. You still can expect the 2019, maybe 2020 etc. still above that line. I just wanted you color on the first year where you'd be in that range. I appreciate it. It obviously depends on divestments as well, but just some comments there. Thanks. ","Tom Palmer","Sure thing. And as we said, this did not exclude basically what Goldcorp's production was through April 17 of this year. So, we'll be addressing that as we go through and have a full 12 months of that production in 2020. This had 12 months for 2019 and it won't be that high. The other thing it doesn't have is any changes as a result of the Nevada joint venture and what might occur due to further project optimization and asset optimization including potential divestment. So, I would stay tuned for what we'd give in terms of an update in July, Chris, once we have further details to provide on the Goldcorp piece. ","Chris Terry","Okay, thanks. And the last one from me, just in terms of the full potential programs, specifically on the Goldcorp assets, how much of that is cost out itself? You've talked about through port and efficiencies, etc. What is actual -- what are their cost opportunities?","Tom Palmer","The vast majority of the benefit's going to come from processing and then mining improvements and then cost outs is sort of kind of come from support and other improvements to relatively small percentage. If you get back to some of our material posted on the website, that details that you can see a pie chart that breaks out those six assets and the contributions from processing, mining support and other where you see the contributions from processing and mining. A lot of that is going to come from improved productivity and reliability as opposed to cost out.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Bridges","Morning, Gary, Nancy, Tom. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering now that the contracts were signed, whether you had to -- if you could sort of talk about surprises, positive negatives that you've picked up as you've been looking at the Goldcorp assets that you've acquired.","Tom Palmer ","John, it's Tom here. No surprises. Our due diligence in subsequent work I've done to prepare for integration is all holding firm. We remain very excited about what we can bring to improve those efforts under Newmont operating model. And the other thing that is proven as through the integration process is the alignment between the two cultures at Newmont and Goldcorp. I've been over the course of my career involved in a number of integration exercises. This has been by far and away the smoothest integration exercise. We move through day one last week without a blip. And I think that's a credit to both the teams at Newmont and Goldcorp and reflection on the alignment between the two cultures of our organizations. ","John Bridges","Okay, great. Just sort of follow-up. I didn't see any mention, although it's early stage of the Colombian assets that I remember being added as a sort of risk to add a little spice to the portfolio. Now that you're differentiating yourself as being a lower risk gold mining alternative, where do you think Columbia sits or does it fit in the new portfolio?","Tom Palmer ","Oh, thanks. Thanks, John. I'm going to hand over to Randy Angle to cover that.","Randy Angle","Hi, John. Thanks for the question. John, we still think that there's very good potential in Columbia. We view it as a long-term opportunity for us and as we step back and take it look at the entire portfolio, we'll be, of course, looking at the exporation potential of Columbia relative to all other regions out there.","John Bridges","Okay. But that's going to need some funding shortly, isn't it?","Randy Angle","Yes, it will. It will need ongoing funding as they continue to ramp up to our production.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Greg Barnes","Thank you. Tom, I think it's a question for you. $365 million in synergies. I think the impression was always that that would be a number that could be achieved relatively quickly, but what kind of ramp up do you expect? What run rate should we be looking for over the next couple of years and towards getting to that number?","Tom Palmer ","Thanks for the question, Greg. We'll certainly get through the three Goldcorp sites that have the greatest value contribution. So, we're predicting that $365 Pe\u00f1asquito to be $50 million Cerro Negro $35 and \u00c9l\u00e9onore $25. We'll have been through our diagnostic process and be delivering value from the full potential work before the end of the year at each of those three sites. And then rolling through into the remaining three sites in the first part of 2020, we will throw our full potential process. You identify quick wins and so you'd expect to start to see value coming from that. There'll be some other activities that might take the order of 12 to 18 months through the full full-potential program. Then in terms of other synergies, the $100 million for G&A, that will come very quickly in terms of rationalizing and we're well down the path of rationalizing the workforce between Vancouver and in Denver and so on and so forth. And then the non-labor costs that come from that and we are actively involved in starting to get some of the supply chain efficiencies coming through. So, we will start to see run rate starting immediately. It will ramp up as we roll out full potential over the course of the next 12 months across the six Goldcorp assets. ","Greg Barnes","So, should I imply that by, let's say the end of 2020, you think you'll be close to our ramp up full run rate, $365 million?","Tom Palmer ","I think that's a very good estimate to make, Greg.","Greg Barnes","Okay. And just to cycle back to Musselwhite. How serious was that fire? And I'm hearing numbers out there like you could be not back in the mind fully operational until six months from now.","Tom Palmer ","It's still early days. It was a serious fire. Any conveyor fire underground is serious. Fortunately, it occurred at a shift change. So, there was now an underground. The fire was contained. But you have to go through when you have an underground fire that involves a conveyor system that you've got to go through a very robust process to understand how you access that area, understand the work to rehabilitate the tunnel and then to remove the damaged conveyor but the rubber and a conveyor structure. So, the team there are currently working through in parallel with the investigation. I work method to be able to re-mediate both the tunnel and to remove the damaged equipment. So, it's still early days to understand that remediation method and then how we might be able to then work through that conveyor tunnel and effect those repairs. So, it's just too early, Greg, to make an estimate of how long that will take.","Operator","The next question will come from Tanya Jakusconek of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Tanya Jakusconek","Great. It's Tonya from Scotiabank. Thank you. Okay. I just wanted to come back to -- I've a technical question for Tom and a financial for Nancy. Just, Tom, and again, we didn't have the Goldcorp numbers, but do you have a sense, at least on Musselwhite what the guidance would have been for the year without this fire? So, we at least would know what Q1 was like and what was the guidance of the year so we could take a stab at what we think could happen at the facet?","Tom Palmer ","I think it's still early days for us to be at it sort of to give you that sort of guidance. I'd hope by the time we come out with our second quarter results, we'll be able to give you a better direction and we'll have greater clarity on the remainder...","Tanya Jakusconek","Oh yes, no worries, Tom. What was the guide? What did the Musselwhite doing in Q1 and what was the original guidance for the year from Musselwhite for 2019?","Tom Palmer ","The issue with Musselwhite is that the materials handling system was an important part of the production for this year. And that will be delayed in ramping up in the second half. So, that's why it's something that we need to work our way through.","Gary Goldberg","And back to the core of your question, it was a little over 200,000 ounces what was planned for the full year out of a Musselwhite tangent, just to give you a flavor. So, even if you cook that out of our overall guidance, it's pretty small...","Tanya Jakusconek","Yes. And I just wondered if we had similar production in Q4 2018 would have been similar to Q1 just for us to play around with that number. Okay. I'll play around with it. Just looking at then, Tom, at any of the other Goldcorp of assets, you said all of the other ones performed in line for Q1. You flagged the Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro, the grades are ramping up, so better second half of the year. Are there any other assets coming in a commercial, are there any other assets that we should be -- you want to flag to our attention within the Goldcorp portfolio that may differ from that guidance that was originally put out?","Tom Palmer ","No, there isn't, Tanya. There's no other. Everything's pretty consistent with what I had provided.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And maybe then just for Nancy just coming in, you mentioned that to look at everything from April 17 for the guidance for Goldcorp. I'm obviously on the Barrick joint venture side on Nevada would be your share from when deal closes. Can I just ask what, besides that, from an operational standpoint, what other costs do we look at for yourself that we may be incurring in Q2 that we haven't thought about? We obviously have the goodwill allocation that we'll take a stab at that. Are there any other costs that we should be factoring in or accounting that wouldn't have an impact in our forecast?","Nancy Buese","Yes. From an accounting perspective you've got it right. There will certainly be some noise in the system around the timing of these various transactions and the changes in reporting fundamentally will be the biggest piece of that. And then certainly we'll have integration costs for both of the transactions, which we'll report to you and then those will be adjusted out for earnings purposes. But yes, fundamentally, we'll be very transparent about those, but there will be additional integration costs for sure. And we will note everything out and then give you our best bridges to understanding both the impact of the Goldcorp transaction and then the Nevada joint venture when that concludes or when that closes.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. We already had some integration costs. So, how much more are we getting in through to Q2? Do we have an idea there?","Nancy Buese","We really aren't in a position to give guidance on that, but we'll certainly report it and be transparent about it upon conclusion.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. So more in Q2. And just on your Nevada joint venture with the Barrick, costs will be reported differently. I would suspect you're under U.S. GAAP, they are under IFRS, will adjustments have to be made for yourselves when we see those numbers?","Nancy Buese","Yes, absolutely. So, Barrick will create the financial statements that underlie the joint venture. Those adjustments will be made and then we will report our share from a proportional consolidation basis and that will be a separate segment in Newmont's financial statements. So, that's how you'll see that running through.","Tanya Jakusconek","And then you'll adjust for your U.S. GAAP cost?","Nancy Buese","Correct. It will be reported under our standards.","Tanya Jakusconek","Anything else different from that joint venture besides that to look forward to?","Nancy Buese","No. We're still working with Barrick as you would imagine on how we will receive all of the financial information that comes through. But again, we'll report that to the best of our ability through as a separate segment. So, you'll have good visibility to our 38 point whatever share of the entire venture. But I would say most of the information and guidance and financial results of the joint venture, you should look to Barrick for those.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And then maybe lastly, when will you be hosting your investor day, so we'd have a lot more clarity on all of this?","Nancy Buese","We're still working to determine that date. Again, we are in the process today of absorbing and gathering all of our information for the Combined Newmont Goldcorp entity. The piece of that we'll have to work for is getting the very material impacts of Nevada JV. That will be something Barrick will compile once we feel like we're in a position to have all of those data points, we would want to provide a very complete picture to the marketplace. So, that will sort of TBD based on when we believe we'll have best information on the Nevada JV.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Stephen Walker","Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just a question, Tom if you would. At Pe\u00f1asquito, the blockage, the roadblock, the disruption around the gate, can you talk a little bit about what triggered that and kind of how the discussions are going? My understanding there's an issue with water or materials handling or something. There was some sort of catalyst that triggered that blockage around, I believe it was water.","Tom Palmer","Morning, Stephen. It's a complex issue. And it's an issue that sort of covers some community members from the local community with some concerns around water and some issues around a trucking contractor. That's a complex issue in that it involves a couple of issues coming together. The blockade is partial and the discussions taking place with those folks are very active and I think I'm quite positive that they'll work through to a sensible resolution in the near-term. So, it's a complex issue. It's a contractor and some community issues and I think our team on the ground there working with local authorities and those stakeholders are actively working through a resolution of those matters.","Stephen Walker","And just as a follow-up, I know that there was a negotiation to get access to water or transport water over properties. Is it just a revisiting of those previous issues with the landholders or is there something more serious with respect to water and material handling, I guess water sourcing or water effluent that may be escaping? Is it use of water or is it -- why does it...","Tom Palmer","No new issues, Stephen. So, it's associated with supply of water rather than issues with water quality or anything like that.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research Partners, please go ahead.","Michael Dudas","Good morning, gentlemen, Nancy. For Gary and Tom, maybe you could share a little bit relative to your initial expectations going into the joint venture with Barrick in Nevada in some of the meetings you've had on the board level with them, have expectations been or exceeded? How do you think about that relative to the dreams that you guys have created finally?","Gary Goldberg","I think it's still early days, Michael. Gary here, as we work very closely with Barrick in terms of items in regards to integration, how you bring the two workforces together. It's been a big focus. Right now, I'd say we're moving as expected at this stage. Regular meetings, in fact, it's been weekly meetings at the board level and meetings not just the board level, a number of folks where this financial folks, human resources, technical folks as we work to help set this joint venture up with Barrick.","Michael Dudas","And my follow-up is when you think about certainly since January's announcement of the Goldcorp transaction and your announcement of the investors or potential in the range, sort of a lot of phone calls back and forth, do you feel like you can be patient on that front or is the marketplace any signals that can maybe generate some better interests in some opportunities here in the more near to intermediate term or is it just trying to get everything under control relative to the integration of both companies to kind of set up where that might be and how we could see those divestitures come through?","Gary Goldberg","No, I think we gave that guidance back in January just to give a flavor that we weren't going to be locked on to any particular asset going forward. We want to make sure we understand the full potential of each of the assets, which is why we're going through the process to make sure we bring in our operating model and take a good look at each of the assets before we make any decisions to move ahead, maybe too hastily on divestiture. So, we continue to get inbounds as you suggest from a variety of different folks and we'll take those on board but we want to really make sure that we understand the assets well before moving forward. And frankly, we didn't have any divestments built into our acquisition model as we went forward, so we're under no pressure to divest in any kind of a timeframe.","Operator","The next question will come from John [indiscernible] Independent Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much. Could you provide a little more explanation of the 38% JV terms in Nevada with Barrick? It looks like it's proportional to gold reserves, maybe giving a little credit for what's on the come at gold rush and four mile [ph] as your car went underground along canyon without giving new enough credit for maybe saving Barrick $0.75 billion for another grocer [ph] and the land, water rights and infrastructure of Newmont's bigger land position.","Tom Palmer","Well, thanks. Thanks, John. I think quite simply the 38.5% versus 61.5% that we came up with was based on consensus NAV by a number of analysts and it took the median of those numbers and came up with that. You could have gone at it lots of different ways and as you know, in the past we tried lots of different ways and never came to a landing. I think we came to a very successful landing both, for Newmont and for Barrick here going forward. And if there is additional reserves that are found on our property that aren't currently in a reserve resource, we have a 1.5% NSR royalty that would get paid to either one of the parties. The one asset that was excluded by Barrick was four mile because that's one that they still continue to go through and hadn't taken to a point where they understand the reserve resource position. So that has a process in which we can bring that into the joint venture going forward.","So, I'm actually quite pleased with where we landed here and how we're bringing things forward and continue to work well with Barrick to bring this joint venture to reality in the next couple of months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for closing remarks.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you for joining our call this morning. I'd really like to thank the entire Newmont Goldcorp team for their efforts to continue to deliver safe and strong business results. We look forward to providing you updates on Newmont Goldcorp, the world's leading gold company throughout the year.

All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for question and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Meredith H. Bandy - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right, thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide two, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website, newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide three.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that we ended 2015 with safer and more efficient operations, a stronger portfolio, and a more resilient balance sheet. This performance is the outcome of our work to instill greater discipline in how we manage our business, to make value our watchword, and to drive accountability deeper into the organization.","While economic growth and metal prices were generally subdued in 2015, we made measurable progress on our strategy to become the world's leading gold business by improving our underlying business from safety to productivity to cost, strengthening our portfolio and creating value by funding our highest-margin projects, reducing debt and paying steady dividends.","I'll turn to slide four for the highlights. Starting at our operations, last year, we lowered injury rates by 18% to among the lowest in the mining sector. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining costs by 10%, marking six consecutive quarters of keeping them below $1,000 per ounce, and we increased gold production to 5 million ounces and copper production to 166,000 tons on an attributable basis.","Moving to our portfolio, we acquired Cripple Creek & Victor, a cash flowing asset in a favorable jurisdiction and progressed the new leach pad and mill. We divested non-core assets, including Waihi and our stake in Valcambi, bringing total asset proceeds to $1.7 billion since 2013.","And we completed the Turf Vent Shaft on time and under budget, giving us access to higher grades and a platform to expand the Leeville mine. We advanced Merian, where we lowered capital from our most recent guidance by another $50 million and remain on track to begin commercial production later this year. We reached the decision to fund the first phase of Long Canyon in Nevada, and an expansion at Tanami in Australia, and we've added 5 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit.","Turning to our balance sheet, we increased our adjusted EBITDA by 29% to $2.7 billion despite a 9% decrease in realized gold price. We more than doubled free cash flows to $756 million, reduced net debt by 19% while continuing to invest in growth, and paid $52 million in dividends and delivered first quartile total shareholder returns versus our competitors. Our sustainability performance also influences our ability to create value.","Turning to slide five, in 2015, Newmont's sustainability performance was rated best in the mining industry by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We also ranked first in the areas of climate strategy and environmental management, labor practices and human rights, and corporate citizenship.","While it's hard to put a dollar value on sustainability, it's clear that superior performance is a prerequisite for managing long-term costs and risks and maintaining the social acceptance we need to operate. The most important way we measure sustainability is by how well we look after our people.","Our goal is to send everyone home safely every day. We're making progress by continually lowering injury rates, and we achieved more than 400 days of zero harm at a team, but this performance was overshadowed by the loss of two colleagues in 2015. Our work to improve safety and productivity will never end.","Turning to operational performance on slide six, in 2015, we lowered our gold all-in sustaining costs for the fourth year in a row, ending below $900 per ounce. This represents a reduction of 24% over the last three years. Our Full Potential Program has been a central force in improving our performance and our competitive position since it was launched in late 2012. To date, we've delivered more than $1 billion in improvements against the 2012 baseline and consistently exceeded our targets. We've launched the second phase of this program at about half our operations with the remainder scheduled in 2016.","Better technical practices are also driving improved reliability. We can't control metal prices, but we have been able to narrow the gap between estimated and actual tonnages and grades, metallurgical recoveries, cost and productivity through more predictable orebody modeling.","Finally, we benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates in 2015, which accounted for about 60% of our overall cost improvements.","Turning to portfolio improvements on slide seven, our goal is to build a portfolio of long life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risk we are well-equipped to manage. We have optimized our portfolio over the last three years, and you can see the results of our efforts on this slide. Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we're able to increase mine life by about 2\/3, lower cost by nearly 20% and lower technical and social risk. I'll take a minute now to walk you through what we're doing to manage risk and make the most of our opportunities in each of our regions.","Turning to slide eight, in North America, the Turf Vent Shaft was completed in November and is now delivering better air circulation and design capacity. Ventilation is so good, in fact, that people are wearing coats in the Leeville underground mine. The team has fine-tuned ground control plans at Leeville and is currently evaluating alternative mining methods. Production and costs were negatively impacted by geotechnical challenges in the fourth quarter, and we expect that trend to reverse in the second half of 2016.","We started mining at Long Canyon and remain on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. Finally, we're making good headway with the Cripple Creek & Victor expansion. Leach pad construction is slightly ahead of schedule with first production expected in the second quarter. Mill availability has also improved, following a scheduled shutdown in December and further improvements are expected in the first half of 2016.","Turning to South America, in Suriname, Merian is about 2\/3 complete, and I'll talk more about that later. In Peru, we're studying a phased approach to developing Yanacocha's remaining oxide and sulfide deposits, and we'll have more to tell you in the second half of the year.","I also want to touch on the reclassification of Conga reserves to resources. This was triggered by certain operating and construction permits expiring at the end of 2015 and uncertain prospects for future development and permitting. We do not anticipate development of Conga for the foreseeable future.","In Africa, we have secured a new investment agreement and built permanent energy capacity in Ghana, both of which create the stability necessary for long-term investment.","Moving on to Asia Pacific, the Tanami expansion project is on track, with the second decline well underway and mill expansion construction beginning in mid-2016. Additional production is expected to come online in 2017. In Indonesia, we received our export permit about two months late, and the delay affected our sales revenue in the fourth quarter.","I also want to address speculation about the potential sale of Batu Hijau. Newmont, with our partner, Sumitomo, are in discussions with certain parties who have expressed serious interest. But to date, none has secured fully committed financing or final deal terms. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently.","Before I hand over to Laurie, I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank Chris Robison, our Chief Operating Officer, for playing a leading role in creating safer and more efficient operations and a stronger portfolio and project pipeline over the past three years. As Chris retires on May 1, we have an exceptional leader in Tom Palmer taking his place.","I've known Tom for more than 15 years. He has a long track record of improving operational performance as he did over the past two years at our Asia Pacific business and we share a strong commitment to safety and productivity and to building the next generation of profitable new mines.","With that, I'll hand it over to Laurie to cover our financial results.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 2015 was a strong year for Newmont, both operationally and financially. Let's turn to slide 10 to review the financial highlights. For the full year, gold costs applicable to sales and gold all-in sustaining costs were both down 10% compared to 2014 and finished below the midpoint of our guidance. Likewise, gold production was up 4% and above the midpoint of our guidance.","For the fourth quarter, gold production was strong and roughly in line with the prior-year quarter. As expected, costs were higher than the previous three quarters. Gold CAS and all-in sustaining costs per ounce were both 8% unfavorable to the prior-year quarter due primarily to lower mill grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo. Consistent with our guidance, CAS is expected to improve by the second half of 2016 as we ramp up production at CC&V and Merian reaches commercial production.","Now turning to slide 11, we delivered over $750 million of consolidated free cash flow in 2015 and generated a 49% improvement in cash from continuing operations despite the 9% drop in the gold price. Our adjusted net income for the year was $507 million or $0.98 per share. And I'm pleased to report that adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was up 29% from the prior year, benefiting from strong copper and gold sales volumes and lower costs applicable to sales.","Turning to the fourth quarter results, adjusted EBITDA of $466 million was strong but lower than the prior-year quarter due to lower metal pricing. We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow and existing cash balances. Last week, our board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.025 per share in line with our gold price-linked dividend guidelines.","Turning to slide 12, let's walk through our net income adjustments. The primary adjustments to our quarterly GAAP net income include a $0.25 tax adjustment, the majority of this relates to tax restructuring and acquisitions and divestitures; an $0.18 non-cash reclamation charge at one of Newmont's legacy sites, this accrual adjustment is for liabilities that will be spent over many years into the future; a $0.03 one-time payment related to prior-period royalties from the revised Ghana investment agreement; and a $0.06 impairment of other long-lived assets and marketable securities.","After adjusting for these items, we reported net income of $20 million or $0.04 per share. EBITDA was also impacted by the non-cash reclamation charge, the revised Ghana investment agreement and asset impairment, in other words, the same items except for taxes, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $466 million for the quarter.","Now, turning to our capital priorities on slide 13, we delivered a step change in financial flexibility and maintained our investment grade balance sheet despite lower metal pricing through a disciplined approach to project development and capital allocation.","In 2015, we generated about $2.2 billion in operating cash flow. After sustaining capital, cash from core operations totaled $1.4 billion. At the end of the year, we also had $2.8 billion of cash on our balance sheet, a 16% improvement from 2014. This includes 2015 net cash from divestitures of about $200 million.","Our strong cash flow and total liquidity position of over $6 billion supports our capital priorities of funding profitable projects, reducing debt and returning cash to shareholders. As you can see during the year, we spent $655 million on development capital, repaid $454 million of debt, and paid $52 million in dividends. Free cash flow was negative for the fourth quarter, primarily due to timing of development capital spend for Merian and Long Canyon.","We had positive cash from core operations of $27 million in the quarter, which didn't cover our Q4 development capital of just over $200 million. It's worth pointing out again that we continue to expect positive free cash flow on an annual basis, but we may not see it every quarter due to timing of development capital expenditures for our growth projects. As I noted earlier, our cash flow from core operations more than covered development capital, debt paydown, and dividends for the year.","We're very pleased with the progress we've made in strengthening our balance sheet during 2015, including $120 million of debt repayment in Q4.","In light of our strong 2015 financial and operating performance and the current gold price environment, we will evaluate options to further reduce gross debt over the coming months.","Slide 14 demonstrates that our discipline has transformed our balance sheet into one of the healthiest in the sector. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.3 times is among the lowest in the industry, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition.","We have reduced our net debt by 19% since 2014 and continue to target a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 time at $1,200 gold. This metric may turn higher at lower pricing, but over time, these levels allow us to maintain investment grade metrics across cycles.","We work with the rating agencies and talk to them frequently to ensure they understand our strategy and results. S&P removed the negative outlook on our BBB rating in June. They also revised their liquidity assessment from strong to exceptional.","Moody's recently placed Newmont and many other metals and mining companies on review. They did this across the board primarily because of their outlook for commodities pricing and their desire to do a review against that pricing deck. In general, the agencies have been very positive about the operating and financial improvements at Newmont.","And with that, I'll hand it back to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Laurie. Let's shift gears to the future starting on slide 16. Our goal is to continue improving our performance in prospects by delivering safe and profitable production, adding higher-margin ounces and advancing our best projects, generating the strong returns we need to invest in growth, reduce debt, and fund dividends and maintaining leading sustainability in governance practices.","Turning to our outlook on slide 17, our outlook has not changed with the exception of the improvement in forecast capital spend at Merian, which I mentioned earlier. We expect to sustain the savings we've achieved to date through efficient operations, optimized projects and value-accretive transactions, and to maintain gold all-in sustaining costs below $1,000 per ounce through 2020.","Over the next two years, costs are expected to benefit from higher-margin ounces at Merian, Cripple Creek & Victor, Tanami, and Long Canyon, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost and capital improvements. Potential upside includes Full Potential savings and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been approved.","Turning to production on slide 18, we expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million ounces and 5.3 million ounces in 2016. Production is then forecast to rise in 2017 as new projects come online. After that, we expect profitable production of at least 4.5 million ounces to 5 million ounces through 2020. In the near-term, higher-margin ounces from Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha in South America.","Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin surface mines and Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika underground resource. Finally, Asia Pacific will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and the higher stripping at Boddington.","Turning to capital on slide 19, our outlook calls for stable and disciplined sustaining capital expenditures over the near-term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development. Sustaining capital is expected to rise slightly in 2017 to cover equipment rebuilds, water treatment and tailing storage facilities. Longer-term, we expect to hold sustaining capitals between $700 million and $800 million per year.","Development capital in 2016 and 2017 will support our current projects, including Merian, Long Canyon and expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor and Tanami. These figures may change as we consider our next profitable growth opportunities.","Turning to our project pipeline on slide 20, projects in the execution phase are progressing on schedule and at or below budget. To recap, Long Canyon is more than 45% complete when we began mining in January. The Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is on track, and the team is evaluating promising options for concentrate processing. Merian was 66% complete at the end of January, and we expect to reach commercial production in the second half of this year. And the second decline at Tanami is nearing completion, and we will begin mill expansion construction in the coming months.","Turning to projects that will be up for funding review in 2016, the Ahafo mill expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve cost. The expansion is expected to offset lower grade ore and accelerate profitable production of stockpiles.","Developing the Subika underground mine would deliver higher grade ore to Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource. We expect to reach decisions on both the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika underground mine in the second half of 2016. Finally, the next cutback at Batu Hijau Phase 7 represents good returns, but requires significant investment. We will not move forward with Phase 7 until we've secured an amended contract of work and project financing.","Turning to our reserves on slide 21, we added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit in 2015 and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. Additions included higher grade ounces at key underground mines, including 1 million ounces at Carlin and 800,000 ounces at Tanami, more than doubling reserves at the Subika underground mine with the addition of 800,000 ounces, and extending the life of KCGM by adding 1.1 million equity ounces, and at Yanacocha by converting 700,000 ounces at [Catcher Main].","These additions helped offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces, divestment of 800,000 ounces, which included Waihi, price-related changes of 3 million ounces largely due to moving an economically marginal layback at a team which is not included in the current mining plan to resources, and net negative revisions of 700,000 ounces, primarily at Ahafo and Ahafo North. The strength of our gold reserves is reflected in slightly higher average year end gold grades of 1.06 grams per ton and reduced sensitivity to lower gold prices.","We lowered our reserve price to $1,200 per ounce at the end of 2015. Operational and portfolio improvements, combined with favorable exchange rates, have reduced the downside sensitivity of a further $100 decrease in gold price to less than half of what it was last year.","Turning to slide 22, in the near-term, we expect a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth to constrain prices. In the medium-term, supply is expected to decrease due to aging ore bodies, slower project development, and fewer new discoveries. These factors, combined with rising demand from emerging market consumers, support a positive outlook for gold prices in the years to come. In the meantime, we're preparing for all scenarios.","Turning to slide 23, our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend. At lower prices, we'd expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital, and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. If gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize costs and capital, fund projects and exploration prospects that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction, and increase dividends in line with our policy.","Summing it all up on slide 24, we're proud of what we've accomplished in 2015, but our sights are set on raising our performance to the next level. This means moving from one of the safest companies in the mining sector to one of the safest among all industries, taking our asset portfolio from good to great, building a strong and diverse talent pipeline, and maintaining leading social, environmental, and governance practices, and generating the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects, reduce debt, and return cash to shareholders.","Thank you for your time. I'd like to now turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Mr. Andrew Quail of Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Morning, Gary, Laurie, and Tony. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is pretty easy. Can you guys just confirm what you actually spent at Merian in the quarter?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What our actual capital spend was for the fourth quarter at Merian?","Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to have to look that up here real quick because I don't have it at my fingertips. But we'll come back to that and look it up.","Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Next one is just on Yanacocha. Could you just, I suppose, comment on what you expect, not on a tonnage perspective, but more so on a grade perspective going forward, especially in 2016, not on production, but just on grade?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Just to answer your first question, on 100% basis, we're about $102 million at Merian. And I'm going to ask Chris Robison to cover where we stand at Yanacocha grade-wise in 2016 versus prior years. What do we expect grade-wise?","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Andrew, as you know, the grade was expected to drop, and so, our expectation, as you can see, the ounces in 2016 were down in the 500,000-ounce range for 2016. And in the foreseeable future, there's \u2013 it's roughly half of where we had been two years ago to three years ago and then as we stepped down in 2015.","Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Do you think it's something between a fourth quarter and a third quarter growth, or is this some sort of \u2013 do you think it's going to be consistent with fourth quarter, or is it going to be sort of more between third quarter and fourth quarter?","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think \u2013 Andrew, I think it's pretty consistent with fourth quarter as grade has ramped down. So, I think pretty consistent through the year. We'll certainly be consistent through the year, and it's similar to fourth quarter.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Chris, I would think you'd say that our guidance that we've given from a cost basis for 2016 is based on the analysis of the grade, and it's going to be \u2013 we're still going to deliver that which is...","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Oh, absolutely.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","...a bit better \u2013 lower than the fourth quarter cost.","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. And they've done a great job in focusing on cost with the declining grade and reducing head count and other significant costs.","Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. And I swear it's my last question, back to Merian, obviously, it's 66% complete. What \u2013 do you think \u2013 it's great you gave a downward revision to CapEx. Do you think that \u2013 do you foresee any more downgrades to CapEx given the project is sort of almost there?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think what we'll be doing, Andrew, is as we get it closer to commercial production, we'll assess where that stands. I think right now we were comfortable making this next reduction. I think the team has done a great job of delivering. Chris was just down there a couple of weeks ago, I was down in December, and just impressed with how the whole project is coming along. But I think we'd hold off to probably midyear or third quarter as we get into commercial production to reassess capital.","Andrew C. Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thanks very much, guys.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Bridges of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is now open.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Morning, Gary, Laurie, everybody. I just wondered on the costs, all-in sustaining costs, you're using GAAP to do your numbers. If you were able to use IFRS, would you all reported all-in sustaining costs be lower? What are the issues between the two systems?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say that over time, there wouldn't be any difference. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, there could be some differences as under one, you might capitalize, on another you might expense, but it actually does a lot to equalize things across the two methodologies.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Are you doing a lot of stripping at the moment? Are you stripping more than normal or about average?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I wouldn't say \u2013 I mean, in Carlin and Twin, we'll have some stripping campaigns over the next couple of years, Carlin currently in one and Twin will come back into one. So those would be the two areas that I'd see any \u2013 I wouldn't call it abnormal. It's just a normal part of their mining cycle. Of course, Batu Hijau if we were to get into Phase 7 would be into one of those as well down the road a couple of years.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay, fine. And then maybe as a follow-on, Yanacocha, you mentioned the sulfides project. I know you're still working on it, but I just wondered if you have more detail there, idea as to what the better options were they?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not at this stage, John. I think we're still sticking to our schedule of reviewing that with the team in June and have more to talk about it in July.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. We look forward to that. Thanks, Gary, and best of luck.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Stephen Walker of RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is now open.","Stephen D. Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just two questions on strategy. First of all, in 2017, obviously there's likely going to be more development capital allocated than is shown on slide 19. But when you look at capital allocation decisions vis-\u00e0-vis organic projects in the feasibility or the pre-feasibility stage versus acquisitions, could you talk a little bit about \u2013 and, again, CC&V is a good example of an acquisition that's strategically fit; talk about the balance between acquisition strategies and organic growth, particularly as you go from 2017 into 2018 where production on paper and without the new projects kicking in, stepping down significantly in 2018 from 2017.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","True, Stephen, I think, first of all, step back. Our core focus is on making sure our operations, the business delivers value. So we're not out for a target of a certain number of ounces per se. It's what's going to deliver the best return to shareholders. So that's why you've heard us say we've announced certain projects, talk about return on capital. That's a big focus. And clearly, we understand our internal projects the best generally. So that's a key focus that we look at. But we do take a look at what's available out there around the rest of the world in terms of opportunities.","We weight all of our operations, our internal projects and external opportunities on the same value and risk scale where we look at value, NPV, return on capital, mine life and position on the cost curve. We look at risks from a technical and a geopolitical and social risk aspect and really make all the decisions based on that in terms of how we then allocate capital. We're targeting roughly 20% to 25% of our free cash flow today to be paid back in dividends.","We're working towards a position of getting our net debt to EBITDA, targeting, as Laurie said, a 1 time ratio at a $1,200 gold price and investing in the business along the way. And as you point out, we're making quite a bit of investment. You see that in our free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we'll see that in the first half. Primarily, it's front-end loaded in 2016. But that kind of gives you a little overview of where our focus is really driven and what's the best value to shareholders is the main driver.","Stephen D. Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for that, Gary. Just again as a separate question on strategy, we've talked in the past about synergies or potential synergies between operations in Nevada, and certainly in 2014 there was discussion at that time of a combination with Barrick, which could considerably generate a lot of synergies, particularly in Nevada. Do you see opportunities in Nevada where you could partner with somebody and achieve synergies, whether it's at Turquoise Ridge or elsewhere the metallurgical operations in Carlin?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think clearly we're focused on running our operations. Just we're joint venture partners with certain parties in Australia where we're managing the KCGM operation now. We're partners at Turquoise Ridge, and we continue to work to look at what the next development opportunities are. All the ore at Turquoise Ridge is processed at our Twin Creeks operation today. And looking at ways to be able to expand that relationship and develop the best value for our shareholders in that process is one of our focuses. So, I wouldn't look away from them, but right now, those would be the areas that we're focused on.","Stephen D. Walker - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is now open.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, Gary and everybody. I guess, my first question, Gary, just again on strategy, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the fact that your U.S. copper operations are basically below breakeven on an all-in sustaining cost basis relative to the current copper price, and if there would be any plans to brown down production there in response to low copper prices? That's my first question.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think, there's two parts and that's the Phoenix operation in the U.S. that's producing copper. You've got the copper that comes with the gold in concentrate and you also have the copper that comes from the SX\/EW. And we do have probably more flexibility around SX\/EW if we were to see a significant decline in copper prices where it wasn't making money on a cash basis. But at this stage, we don't have any plans to make a change. But that would be the one we'd have probably the most flexibility initially to make a change on.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, when you define running them for cash, you define that as C1. You're not thinking AISC cash as being the breakeven?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. If we get down to it, we'd be looking at C1. But we'd continue to assess that as we go forward.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And as Gary said, part of that is in with the concentrate and so, you really have to look at the combined copper-gold because there is an allocation of cost which can be somewhat academic and isn't always guaranteed to be 100% accurate. You're really looking at the combined product and what margin you get out of that.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. And then, just that leads into sort of my second strategic question, when you guys think about potentially selling assets in certain parts of the world and reinvesting, where does copper rank relative to gold? Are you kind of metals agnostic or are you leaning more towards increasing your gold projects going forward?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're very confident at operating gold operations around the world. We do have the three copper-gold deposits that we operate today, but our focus would be on gold primarily. But if there was something of value that was gold with some copper with it, we'd consider it, but our focus is really on gold, Jorge.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. And sorry, if I could just get a last one in for Laurie, specifically, Laurie, if we could just get a better baseline and maybe just an explanation as to what continues to happen with the other expense category. I can understand a lot of that is non-cash. But just looking at your year ahead guidance, it seems to imply about a $250 million midpoint for SG&A, including \u2013 I'm assuming that category includes others given that your actual SG&A runs at about $180 million. So, I'm assuming \u2013 is it correct to think you're using about a $70 million assumption annually for others?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the other thing is we talked about this at Investor Day that we have moved our regional G&A into G&A and out of other, so you're going to see some changes in that going forward. And we can give you a lot of detail, if you'd like, offline. The other is a fairly complex area, and a lot of it is non-cash, as you mentioned. But it should be coming down as we make some of these changes that will provide a little bit more transparency.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. That would be great to get some more color there just because, recurrently, it seems to be an area of negative surprise, and on cash basis, I mean, this does work out to be somewhere upwards of about $40 an ounce, give or take, annually. It would seem like some fairly low-lying fruit if you guys could get a better handle on controlling those recurrent others. So, I just wanted to flag that. Thanks.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. And we definitely take a look at it, and we'll get back to you with some more detail, Jorge.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jorge.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaip of BMO. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Good morning, Gary and Laurie.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Good morning. The first question I have, Gary, is just for you. Thanks for providing some clarity on Batu Hijau and the fact that you have parties that are interested. I'm wondering if you're in a position to just comment on the quality of those groups that are interested. Do you see them as viable groups that are just assembling up the capital to be able to make an offer, or is it \u2013 can you comment on that?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I am going to ask Randy to give a comment.","Randall E. Engel - Executive Vice President-Strategic Development","Andrew.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi.","Randall E. Engel - Executive Vice President-Strategic Development","Yes. The viability is certainly high enough that we felt appropriate to mention, and they're serious parties like we mentioned at Investor Day. We've really only engaged in parties that we felt were viable. Financing in this market has been challenging, but I think that's the case across the sector. So we certainly view them as very real parties.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Are you looking at more than one group that is interested? Or is it just one particular group that is entertaining it?","Randall E. Engel - Executive Vice President-Strategic Development","I think we've looked and talked to a number of groups. We've got some serious interested parties right now that we're focused on our discussions with.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","All right. Thanks very much. And then, the second question, Laurie, congratulations on further debt reduction. I'm just wondering and you made comments about potential further debt reduction or gross debt reductions early this year or into 2016. Can you comment on your strategy now? Still a very healthy cash position in Newmont, and I understand the need for it is clear as you're constructing projects. But at some point in time, those cash requirements are going to abate, and I'm wondering what your strategy there is?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thank you, Andrew. And, yes, I think the whole team deserves a lot of credit for this debt paydown. We don't do it in finance. But we definitely have some project-level debt at PTNNT that we expect to be paying down throughout the year.","And then we've also considered the concept of doing a tender on some of our outstanding corporate debt. We do have the cash, as I said, in December. We're monitoring the gold price and want to make sure that we don't take undue risk.","But as you point out, where we're at right now, both financially and where we are within our projects, that definitely could be something on the horizon. We just have to make sure that the timing fits with all the other things.","And as you know, we get into the blackout windows and everything around our quarters. So, our timing to be able to do those things can sometimes be limited. But we definitely, obviously, have the capability, and we'll be studying that quite a bit going forward.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","All right. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Haughton of Imperial Bank of Commerce. Sir, your line is now open.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary, Laurie, Chris, and Randy. Got some questions on the CapEx. Firstly, looking at Merian, you've put guidance there for 2016 of $170 million to $210 million. Is that on 100% basis, or is that your 75% share?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's 100%.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Excellent. And during the presentation, Gary spoke to some $50 million worth of savings. What kind of savings were generated? Is it as a consequence of currency or energy or some other element that you'd want to talk about?","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, David, I think, it comes \u2013 obviously, it's exchange rate and fuel price plays a big role there. But also, from my recent visit there, mining has some very unique approaches in terms of logistics which you can imagine is pretty interesting, getting gear into the Amazon Jungle, where we have saved costs, and even in assembling gear there, where a lot of equipment is obviously fabricated, but then assembled in Europe, in the U.S. or Canada, and then transported in and basically just bolted together. And so, as we do more of that, that's probably after FX and fuel price, biggest savings is less labor cost and less high-tech labor at site.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. And I know that Andrew Quail had asked \u2013 was heading in a similar kind of direction. Your sustaining CapEx is about $100 per ounce. Can you see any of those kind of experiences moving over to your ongoing CapEx, or is it really quite specific about the build capital?","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's more specific. I think a big sustaining project, something where there was a lot of gear, I think we've learned a lot from that. But we would certainly take these ideas to other big projects in the future. Some great experience there and knowledge we've gained.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, it's transferrable, say, to what might happen in Ghana, for instance, if you push the button for the expansions?","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Absolutely, yes. And in .","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Yes. Just going over to Long Canyon the CapEx remaining is around about $250 million to $300 million. Is that up from what your previous expectations were?","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's pretty well in line with expectations. We're assuming a bit lower spend there again mainly due to fuel costs, but should be pretty line-balled of what we had previously forecast.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, our $250 million to $300 million is full project spend from the beginning. So that hasn't changed at this stage.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Only about half of that in 2016.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay, all right. Well, thank you very much and, Chris, enjoy your retirement.","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tanya Jakusconek with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.","I have two questions, one is technical and one is financial. Maybe just on the technical side, can we talk a little bit about the geotechnical issues that you were experiencing at Leeville, exactly what's happening there? I understand there's more ground support that's going in, but what are you seeing underground that's different from what originally you were expecting and how do we see this cost improving through the year? So maybe that's my first question.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tanya. I'm going to have Chris handle that one.","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, Tanya, I think a couple of pieces to this. One, it's one particular area in Leeville, so it's not an impact across the whole Leeville\/Turf complex. It's one area where due to the faulting, while we had an expectation there of poor ground conditions, our current mining approach, the long hole stoping leads to more geotech issues.","So, one of the things that we're looking at is a cut-and-fill approach in this particular area of the mine. That would lead to more selective mining, so higher grade, higher cost that may offset one another as you'd be mining less tons, higher cost but higher grades. So, we see the impact of this through \u2013 because of this area, it's an isolated area in the mine, the impact this year, but certainly not longer-term.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.","So is it safe to say that we're just in the sort of faulted area for the first half, and then once you come out of it, we're back to long hole stoping?","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yes. And we would be long hole stoping elsewhere in the operations. Just this one area, we would go to this modified mining approach.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.","Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then, Laurie, a question for you, and I appreciate you mentioned your target for net debt to EBITDA at 1 time at $1,200 gold price. Is it safe to assume that, we've got obviously the Merian CapEx that's coming through in the first half of the year, you have to make a decision on Ahafo, Subika in the second half of the year.","Do we look at it that any excess cash flow above that spend that assumes you've made the decision to go ahead on Ahafo and Subika, still keeping a minimum cash balance of $2 billion on the balance sheet, anything above and beyond that would go to paying down the debt?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think we would certainly evaluate a variety of different things, other options that we might have, what does the gold price look like at that point in time. Theoretically, you're probably not far off about what we do, but there would definitely be timing and other things that would come into play before we would move on that. But I definitely see the ability for us to pay down some incremental debt this year.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital Inc.","Okay. Okay. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Garrett Nelson of BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi. Thank you. I think you mentioned lower ore grades at Yanacocha and Ahafo as the primary drivers of the year-over-year increase in your total cost per ounce. But it looks like your North American cost \u2013 CAS, were up about 9% and was driven by Carlin. Remind us why your cost is so much higher at Carlin? And looking at 2016, are you expecting your cost per ounce in that region to come down as the year progresses and as production ramps at Turf Vent Shaft and so forth?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, overall \u2013 I mean, first of all, our cost came down year-on-year and just to remind folks, especially all-in sustaining and we have had the moves around Yanacocha as we get closer towards the end of the existing mine life. We have expected those costs to come up as production comes down.","Carlin was a factor of some of the items that Chris mentioned as we're dealing with some of the geotechnical issues plus came to the end of some stripping and some grade-related issues. Our guidance still that we provided in early December in terms of where we expect our cost to be for 2016 hasn't changed from what we provided and still remains the same.","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","And the Paceville project at Carlin would have impacted cost.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That would have affected sustaining capital in the fourth quarter spend, yes.","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And then your leverage ratios have obviously come down a lot over the last several quarters. Remind us whether you have a target leverage ratio. And if so, what is your target?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. What we've said, Garrett, is that we'd like to be at 1 times debt to EBITDA when gold price is $1,200. Obviously, the EBITDA moves around a bit as the gold price moves around a bit. But if we think about it that way, we're confident that we can maintain investment grade metrics as the gold price moves in through the cycles.","Garrett Scott Nelson - BB&T Capital Markets","All right, great. Thanks very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Garrett.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to hand the call back to Gary Goldberg for any final remarks.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining today. I'm pleased with the changes we've made over the past few years that have positioned Newmont to be the world's leading gold business. We'll continue to focus on our strategy to deliver long-term value by improving our underlying business from safety to productivity to costs, strengthening our portfolio, and creating value by funding our highest-margin projects, reducing debt, and paying steady dividends.","Thanks, again, for joining us and have a safe day.","Operator","Thank you.

Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Meredith H. Bandy - Vice President-Investor Relations","All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's first quarter earnings call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide two. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now, I will turn it over to Gary on slide three.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont. We continued to improve our performance and our prospects by lowering injury rates and costs at our operations, bringing proceeds from non-core asset sales to nearly $2 billion, building four profitable growth projects on time and at or below budget and strengthening our balance sheet and earnings and earning the best credit rating in the gold sector. Finally, we added two highly experienced miners to the Newmont roster to lead our business in Africa and Asia-Pacific.","Turning to specifics on slide four. Our underlying business improvements for the quarter included reducing total injury rates by 37% compared to last year, lowering our all-in sustaining costs to $828 per ounce and dropping our 2016 cost outlook by another $20 per ounce and increasing gold production by 4% to 1.2 million ounces and copper production by 3% to 38,000 tonnes on an attributable basis.","Our portfolio improvements for the quarter included reaching commercial production ahead of schedule at the new valley leach facility at Cripple Creek & Victor, selling our stake in Regis for $184 million and advancing our growth projects. Merian is 80% complete, Long Canyon is 65% complete and our second decline at Tanami is nearly finished.","Value creation for the quarter included delivering adjusted EBITDA of $803 million on the back of higher grades and production at lower cost and sustaining capital, generating free cash flow of $227 million while continuing to self fund for growth projects, reducing net debt by 16% and completing a $500-million bond tender which will lower our cash interest payment by about $28 million annually. Long-term value creation requires exceptional safety and sustainability performance.","Turning into slide five. Our team worked without any injuries at Twin Creeks, Ahafo and Akyem in the first quarter of 2016. We've lowered our total injury rates by 58% since 2012, and we continue to work toward our ultimate goal which is to send all of our people home safely every day.","In 2015, our sustainability performance was rated best among mining companies by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and best in the areas of climate strategy, labor practices, human rights, corporate citizenship and environmental management. Newmont is also ranked as the top mining company in the S&P 500 for environmental, social and governance performance and in the top 10 overall according to Bloomberg's ESG disclosure score. The score is intended to measure a company's capacity to anticipate and manage risks and help investors weigh this competency on a consistent basis. You can read more about our performance on our website, where we recently published our 2015 sustainability report beyond the mine. We're also continuing to improve our operational efficiency.","Turning to slide six. We brought our all-in sustaining cost down to $828 per ounce in the first quarter of 2016. This represents a 2.5% improvement versus the prior-year quarter and a 30% improvement since 2012. About half of these savings were realized through sustainable cost and efficiency improvements at all of our operations and higher production at our lower cost operations. Running our operations more efficiently starts with solid technical fundamentals.","For example, better resource modeling, which has improved ore body reliability at Boddington, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha, an advanced process modeling technology, which we're using to improve recoveries at Boddington, Phoenix, Yanacocha and Ahafo; and to bring the Cripple Creek & Victor Mill to full design capacity.","Finally, we're raising our technical game in underground mining and using improved techniques to manage ground control issues at Leeville, which includes some of our most prospective underground resources. Our costs also benefited from favorable oil prices and exchange rates and lowering capital spending. Sustaining capital was lower primarily due to timing, but we also expect some savings as the year progresses.","Turning to production on slide seven. We're on track to meet production guidance of 4.8 million ounces to 5.3 million ounces of gold in 2016. Factors contributing to this performance include drier-than-expected weather in Indonesia, which allowed us to continue mining higher-grade Phase 6 ore and improve productivity at KCGM and Boddington in our Asia-Pacific region; new production from Cripple Creek & Victor, which increased our North America production by 13% versus the prior-year quarter; and strong performance at Akyem and Ahafo in Ghana. These increases more than offset declines in South America, as we reached lower grade and transitional ores at Yanacocha.","Looking forward, we expect higher second half production at Cripple Creek & Victor and our Leeville underground mines, which will offset lower production due to planned maintenance shutdown at Carlin's Mill 6 in the second quarter. In Indonesia, we applied for our export permit ahead of schedule to facilitate a timely renewal. Our discussions with certain parties who are interested in acquiring our stake in PTNNT continue, but financing and deal terms have not yet been finalized. In the meantime, we remain focused on operating Batu Hijau safely and efficiently. The work we do to improve the value of our operations also applies to our portfolio.","Turning to slide eight. Our overarching goal is to build a portfolio of long-life, low-cost assets with technical and sociopolitical risks we're well equipped to manage. We've realized $1.9 billion from the sale of non-core assets since 2013, most recently selling our equity stake in Regis for $184 million. And we've deployed capital to self fund our most profitable growth projects, pay down debt and return cash to shareholders.","Comparing what we divested to what we reinvested in, we have increased mine life by about 2\/3, lowered costs by nearly 20% and improved our technical and social risk profile. The expansion at our newest portfolio addition, Cripple Creek & Victor is progressing ahead of schedule.","Turning you slide nine. This is a photo of the new valley leach facility which began first production in March, a month ahead of schedule. The recovery plant is also on track for completion by the end of the year.","Finally, we finished modifications at the Cripple Creek & Victor mill which accounts for about 25% of the operation's production. This expansion, along with new mines at Merian and Long Canyon and the expansion at Tanami, will add up to 1 million ounces of production at competitive costs as these projects come online.","We're also adding capacity in our leadership ranks, starting with our board of directors. Noreen Doyle succeeded Vince Calarco as Chair of Newmont's Board earlier this week. Noreen has been a director since 2005 and has served as Vice-Chair and Head of our Audit Committee. Her background includes executive leadership at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and board leadership at Credit Suisse. Last year, she was appointed Chair of the British Banking Association. Vince will continue as a Newmont Director and will work closely with Noreen to ensure a smooth transition.","Turning to management. Tom Palmer steps in as Chief Operating Officer on May 1. Tom brings 22 years of mining experience to this role, the last two of which had been at Newmont strengthening our performance in the Asia-Pacific region. Tom will pick up where Chris Robison left off, driving the next wave of safety and operational performance improvement across the portfolio.","Steve Dumble takes Tom's place as Head of the Asia-Pacific region. He's a 34-year mining veteran, whose background includes leadership roles in a range of commodities for BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, and Alcoa. And Alwyn Pretorius joins Newmont as our Head of our Africa Region bringing 20 years of gold mining experience to the role. Both Stephen and Alwyn have track records of delivering successful projects and transformative change in the areas of safety, productivity, sustainability and leadership development. We are pleased to have them on the team.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter again with solid financial results.","Turning to slide 11. We reported first quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations of $0.15 per share. Excluding $0.38 per share of non-cash tax valuation allowances and $0.20 per share for the gain we achieved on the sale of our stake in Regis, we reported first quarter adjusted net income of $0.34 per share. The valuation allowances are related to a tax restructuring of a foreign subsidiary acquired back in 2002 as part of the Normandy acquisition. Below, you can see a similar outcome in adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, also excluding the gain on the Regis sale.","Turning to slide 12 for a look at our first quarter operational performance. On top line results, gold and copper pricing were down a bit from the prior-year quarter. Attributable gold and copper production volumes held relatively steady year-over-year. You will note that copper sales volumes were up 13% from last year as we were able to catch up on some of the delayed shipments from Batu Hijau in Q1 as we had expected.","Gold CAS was up 4% from the prior-year quarter predominantly because Yanacocha is now producing more deep transitional ore. This is in line with our expectations. But you'll also see that overall gold CAS is down significantly from Q4 2015, as expected.","Gold AISC improved versus the prior-year quarter in part due to timing of explorations and advanced project spending. As Gary mentioned, we expect to see cost improvements in the second half of 2016 as CC&V and Leeville ramp up and Merian comes online. However, the second quarter will be impacted by scheduled maintenance at Carlin's Mill 6.","Turning to slide 13 for a summary of first quarter financials. Higher volumes allowed us to deliver higher revenue despite slightly lower gold and copper prices. We delivered strong Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $803 million, essentially in line with the prior year, reflecting continued strong operational performance across the portfolio.","During the quarter, we also generated positive free cash flow of $227 million. As I have mentioned, we expected lower free cash flow in the first half of this year, but strong operational performance, commodity tailwinds and a bit of timing came together to help us deliver an outstanding start to the year.","The only real difference compared to last year's first quarter was working capital movement. For example, an increase in accounts receivable was in line with the stronger sales volumes during the quarter. We also maintained our dividend of $0.025 per quarter or $0.10 per year.","Now, turning to slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash in the first quarter and how we've applied them to deliver on our capital priorities. Cash from core operation, where operating cash was sustaining capital from our operating site, generated over $400 million this quarter, plus we received $184 million in cash proceeds from the sale of Regis. A primary use of cash in the quarter was the $186 million of development capital spent to support our future. This was primarily spent at Merian, Long Canyon, CC&V and Tanami.","We also completed the debt tender, which I will talk more about in a minute, and paid our quarterly dividend. In addition, given our comfort level with the local cash position and our overall liquidity, Yanacocha paid a dividend. Part of that was paid to our partners and part to Newmont in the U.S. The restricted cash and other is primarily movement out of cash and into restricted cash to cover the scheduled payment on the PTNNT revolver next quarter.","Net-net, at quarter end, we have about $2.5 billion of cash and equivalent to repay debt, fund growth \u2013 profitable growth and return cash to shareholders, in other words, to continue delivering on our capital priorities.","Turning to slide 15 to discuss the balance sheet. Newmont has lowered net debt by 37% since 2013. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.2 times remains among the lowest in the industry, and our strong cash flow and balance sheet continue to differentiate Newmont from the competition. We are committed to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet across the gold cycle. To do that, we target net debt to EBITDA of 1 time at $1,200 gold and seek to lower our absolute level of gross debt.","Turning to slide 16 to talk more about our debt schedule. In the first quarter, we completed a $500-million debt tender, targeting near-term maturities and highest interest rate debt. On this slide, you can see we paid down $274 million of the 5-1\/8 notes due in 2019 and $226 million of the 6-1\/4 notes due in 2039. This action had an NPV of $133 million and will lower our cash interest by about $28 million per year going forward. We continue to target between $800 million and $1.3 billion of debt reduction through 2018.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Laurie. Turning to the future on slide 18. Over the next few years, we expect our cost to benefit from higher margin ounces at our new mines and expansions, higher grade ore at Batu Hijau and Carlin underground mines and ongoing productivity, cost and capital improvements. Upside that is not reflected in our current outlook includes more Full Potential savings, which we have netted more than $1 billion in improvements to-date and lower cost ounces from projects that have not yet been through the board approval process.","We expect steady gold production of between 4.8 million ounces and 5.3 million ounces in 2016, rising to between 5.2 million ounces and 5.7 million ounces in 2017, as new projects come online. In South America, higher margin ounces for Merian are expected to offset declining volumes at Yanacocha. Similarly, in North America, lower cost production from Cripple Creek & Victor, Long Canyon and Carlin underground mines is forecast to offset stripping phases at Carlin surface mines and at Twin Creeks. Development of Northwest Exodus represents further upside not represented in our guidance. The team in Ghana is optimizing projects to address harder ore and lower grades in Ahafo surface mines and to develop the highly prospective Subika Underground resource. Finally, in the Asia-Pacific region, we will leverage the Tanami expansion to counter lower grades and higher stripping at Boddington. Strong operating performance translates to strong financial performance.","Turning to slide 19. We reduced our all-in sustaining costs by $279 per ounce or 24% between 2012 and 2015, an improvement that was more than double the competitive average. We also reduced net debt by $1.7 billion over the last two years for a total reduction of 33%, which compares favorably to an average net debt reduction of 1% among our competitors. Our return on capital employed was about 80% higher than the gold sector average, and our 2015 free cash flow yield was also higher than the average.","Turning into projects on slide 20. Merian is 80% complete, about $100 million below budget and on track to reach commercial production later this year. Long Canyon is now 65% complete and remains on track to begin production in the first half of 2017. And the Tanami expansion is on budget and ahead of schedule with additional production expected in the second half of 2017.","Finally, Our Cripple Creek & Victor expansion is progressing ahead of schedule and on budget. Together, these projects will add up to $1 million ounces at average all-in sustaining costs of around $700 per ounce. Our next tranche of projects is not included in our long-term outlook. These could add 250,000 ounces of annual production and reduce all-in sustaining costs by another $30 per ounce.","Projects that will be considered for full funding in 2016 include the Ahafo mill expansion, which would leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs; the Subika Underground mine, which will deliver higher grade ore to the Ahafo mill and create a platform to explore the region's highly prospective underground resource; and incremental expansions at Northwest Exodus and Twin Creeks underground.","Turning to exploration on slide 21. Exploration is one of our core competencies and it's key to long-term value creation. Our team discovered 70% of the ounces we'll produce this year and has added more than 115 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years.","Our competitive advantage rests on our proprietary technologies, which are deployed by an expert team of nearly 200 geoscientists around the world and our land position which includes 52,000 square kilometers in prospective districts, 75% of which are in North America and Australia. In 2015, we added 5 million ounces to our gold reserves by the drill bit and 4 million ounces by acquiring Cripple Creek & Victor. These additions more than offset depletion of 6.5 million ounces. We also maintained the highest reserve ounces per share in the gold sector.","Our annual exploration budget is just under $200 million, and we'll spend about 75% of that amount adding higher margin ounces just in time to support our operations. The remaining 25% will be spent on new discoveries mainly in brownfields around our existing mines with some optionality in greenfields in each of our regions.","Turning to slide 22 for a closer look at North America. The Rita K \u2013 Pete Bajo area located Southeast of Leeville is an exciting exploration story with significant upside potential. We've identified new trends using this proprietary deep sensing geochemistry technology and, in 2015, increased our resources by about 130% with 16% higher grades.","You can see the layout of the 3-kilometer mineralized corridor in this plan view. Less than 1\/3 of the mineral inventory has been converted to reserves and resources and a significant percentage is yet to be drill tested. Mineralization also remains open in all directions.","Turning to slide 23. These long sections shows more detail. Drilling at the Fence\/Full House trend has delivered 250,000 ounces of reserves and 450,000 ounces of resource at exceptional grades. We plan to drill another 10,000 meters in 2016 to further define this deposit. Rita K is a new host discovery, contiguous with our Pete Bajo mine. We expect to declare first resource in 2018 and to drill another 9,500 meters in 2016.","Now, turning you to our view on gold fundamentals on slide 24. In the near term, we anticipate that a relatively strong U.S. dollar and subdued global economic growth will continue to constrain metal prices. That said, we've seen some notable improvements in the first quarter of 2016. Gold price increased by about 16%, the strongest upward trend since 1980. And electronically-traded fund holdings increased by 20%, reversing significant declines since 2011. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals.","On the supply side, three-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012, and mining supply is expected to decrease by more than 5% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development.","On the demand side, we expect demographic trends in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the two countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. China's middle class is expected to grow to 500 million by 2020, and India's middle class is also expected to double and surpass 500 million by 2025. In the meantime, we're prepared for all scenarios.","Turning to slide 25. Our planning process builds from a gold price of $900 per ounce, which informs our contingency plans. At today's metal prices, we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration prospects, reduce debt and maintain our dividend.","At lower prices, we would expect to finish existing projects, potentially delay new projects, stripping campaigns and sustaining capital and further reduce overhead and exploration costs. As gold prices improve, we'll continue to optimize cost and capital, fund projects and exploration that offer strong returns, accelerate debt reduction and increase dividends in line with our policy.","Summing it all up on slide 26. We're proud of what we've accomplished over the last three years, and we're continuing that trajectory in the first quarter of 2016. Going forward, our sights remain set on raising our performance to the next level.","You can count on us to continue improving safety and efficiency at our operations, maintaining leading environmental, social and governance practices; building a stronger portfolio of longer life, lower cost mines and generate the financial flexibility we need to fund our best projects; reduce debt; and return cash to shareholders.","Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from John Bridges from JPMorgan. Sir, you have an open line.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Gary, everybody. Congratulations on the results. Just wondered if there are any sort of catalysts with respect to the Batu deal. You said it's not finalized yet, but you sounded quite optimistic. Just wondered if there are any catalysts. And then, maybe just a follow-on. The Subika-Ahafo project, just wondered if, after the cost cutting you managed to achieve at Merian, whether there was some hope to bring those costs down as well. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you. On Batu, really, nothing has changed in terms of \u2013 we continue to work with those potential parties to finalize deal terms and to make \u2013 get the financing put together. So, no other catalysts that I would point to other than those two key areas. In regards to Subika and Ahafo, we continue to go through the final steps. It's permitting. It's probably one of the bigger things at Subika to bring through, and the timing of that still is looking for both Subika Underground and the Ahafo Mill to bring those forward in the third quarter, late \u2013 well, actually, early fourth quarter for approval by the board. There are synergies between the two. We're carrying them separately, so we understand what each one is individually. But there are synergies of bringing those two together, John.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Andrew Kaip from BMO. Sir, you have an open line.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thanks very much, Gary, and congratulations to you and your team on a solid Q1. My question is regarding Merian. Can you provide us a bit more detail on how you're preparing to enter into commissioning? You're in a tropical environment. If it's \u2013 if I'm not mistaken, the rainy \u2013 the second rainy season begins in the fourth quarter. And I'm just wondering how you're preparing to enter that operation into commercial production through the remainder of 2016.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good question, Andrew, and we're looking still here in the second half of this year to enter into commercial production. We will have a little closer view of when that may start when we do our second quarter results in July. We do stockpile material, and we'll be stockpiling. We currently have, like, 1.2 million tonnes, 1.3 million tonnes of ore stockpiled right next to where the mill is. So, we're in good shape. That's a little over a month' supply of ore that's there to be able to handle, and that's part of the design we have. And we based it off how they did the design at Rosebel as well, where they had the same concerns as they work through the rainy season and the dry season and how we operate in other places around the world.","So, I think, with the stockpile, that puts us in a good position to be able to work through the rainy season as we go through startup, and that's progressing really well. As I say, the construction is looking very good. Chris was just down there about a month ago reviewing progress, and we're pretty pleased with how that whole project continues to progress and progress at lower cost of capital than what we expected to begin with.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","All right. And then, just given the guidance that you started off with at the beginning of the year that you felt the first two quarters would be free cash flow neutral to consuming cash, Laurie, I'm just wondering what your view or your outlook in the second quarter is. Are you still of the view that the capital programs will consume operating cash flow in the second quarter?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would expect that the \u2013 we would spend more capital. We did have a good tailwind with gold price in Q1. And as you remember, our oil price assumptions are somewhat on the conservative side, perhaps, so we could benefit from those. Well, we did see some timing of capital happened in the first quarter that probably will be made up in the second quarter. So, it was a good quarter, but we do see the second quarter being a little bit of a dip. And as Gary and I both mentioned, Carlin's Mill 6 will go down for maintenance, so that will impact the quarter as well.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then, we'll see the stronger second half as these projects start up.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right, exactly.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question is coming from David Haughton from CIBC. Sir, you have an open line.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary and Laurie, and the rest of the team. Thank you for hosting the call. First question is looking at CC&V. You've had this asset now for nearly three full quarters. Just wondering if anything could have surprised you on the upside or downside since you have taken ownership.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'm going to have Chris Robison, who is down there most recently, to walk through some of the work as we \u2013 especially as we begun Full Potential.","Christopher J. Robison - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. David, I think I'd look at it in two pieces. Obviously, the leach, we've been able to bring the new valley leach online sooner than expected. So, certainly, an upside there and that will continue through the year as we complete that project.","The mill performance \u2013 so, if I shift gears over to mill performance, we continue to improve that performance and are very pleased with the progress that we've made there. And as you may recall, the next phase of the mill, which, again, is obviously something that we've talked about before, but taking concentrate to Nevada potentially starting next year.","So, first phase was getting the mill up to full performance. Phase two is really simplifying the flow sheet and taking concentrate to Nevada, which is a good excellent synergy with the demand for heat value in the roaster and the autoclave.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, overall, we're still very comfortable, David, with the 10% mining cost improvement that we built into our acquisition plans and feel comfortable we'll be able to do better than that. But I'd just say we just started our Full Potential project, and we'll go through that and have more updates through \u2013 well later in the year.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Just to follow on from Chris' comments there about the mill. The recovery at the mill was a touch lower than what we would have expected. My recollection was that you're kind of targeting the high-70% and then you could probably get a little bit more out if you put the tiles onto the leach pads. Where are you kind of expecting the recoveries to go for the balance of the year?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, fair question. Those recoveries are pretty much in line with what we had expected, David, I think high 60s. And then, that's through the mill and then \u2013 as you may recall. Then, when you put it out on the leach pad, you pick up another roughly something 12%, 15% over time as you would from the leach.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. If I could just switch over on an operational question for Batu. So, you've had some reasonably good weather based on your introductory comments there, Gary. Ordinarily, we would have expected the better grades to come through in the second and third quarter. Just wondering what we should we be thinking about as far as where that grade may go given the kind of changes in the weather patterns that you're seeing.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Basically, we had drier weather in the quarter, so it allowed us to stay in the bottom of the pit in the higher grade part of the ore body for a longer period of time. So, what we've done is accelerated production and moved it forward from later this year and even from 2017, we'd expect, if we have a normal sort of a rainy season pattern.","I think the only piece that I'd flag is we looked and we've got our export permit that we've \u2013 we've filed our application to move forward is making sure we get that on time. That could be something that could affect our second quarter shipments if that doesn't come through in a timely manner. But basically, I'd see our overall production up slightly from what we had forecast overall, and it's pulled forward.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","And with those permits, Gary, are they now becoming a little bit more systematic in getting the granting of it or is it a case-by-case basis?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's been case by case. It's still tied to, obviously, the requirements we have with our mine plan, and that part works pretty well. I think the other pieces are work to support Freeport as they look at the smelter, and we continue to work with them in those plans. But that sits within the bigger picture of how overall smelting development and the changes that I know that they're looking at for their contract to work and how that all fits in.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","With a bit of luck, it will be someone else's problem by the time the year ends.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I wouldn't quite go there, but we will continue to operate it as if it's ours and going to continue to operate it that way.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Thank you, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Tanya Jakusconek from Deutsche Bank. Ma'am, you have an open line.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Good morning. I think it's Scotiabank. I just wanted to ask two questions, if I could. The first one is on Leeville. Gary, can we get an update on how the costs are doing at Leeville? I think, last quarter, we were in some difficult ground conditions that needed additional support and I think we were supposed to get through that in the first half of the year. Can we just get an update on where we are on that and whether that's still the plan?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that still fits very well, Tanya, in terms of what we're doing. We're actually using a different type of rock bolt, a longer cable bolt in the process. We're seeing very good results out of that, but we're having to go through and re-bolt in a number of areas using this new type of bolt and that will take through the second quarter. So, we'll see the higher costs, as we said earlier, in the first half versus the second half of this year.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my second question is on Batu Hijau. Sorry to come back to Batu. I just wanted to make sure that I understood. Is it safe to assume, Gary, that all of the technical due diligence from the interested parties has been completed? Is that a safe assumption?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's a safe assumption. We're looking at financial \u2013 or the deal terms as well as making sure they have the financing now.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","And my second question on that is, are the deal terms something that still need to be negotiated? Or have those come to sort of an agreement and we're only really waiting for the finances \u2013 the financial to be put in place in order to complete this deal? I'm just trying to understand what the outstanding issues are.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. It's really elements of the deal terms and the financing that remain. So, both of those areas still remain outstanding.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you for that. And sorry, if I could, ask one last question on Ahafo. I know that you mentioned that \u2013 and John asked the questions on the synergies of the expansion and Subika Underground. I understand perhaps you don't have the financial implications. But maybe just qualitatively, what would synergies of putting those together be?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's synergies and a bit infrastructure, power \u2013 and really, where you bring ore in into the sequence, it's a mine plan element and you're able to shift some of the lower grade out and have more capacity. So, it's grade related. We'll have more details on that when we get to the point of actually having approval, and we'll share that information with you and the rest of the market.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","And so, you mentioned it is grade related. So, obviously, that could help the cash cost in the earlier years. But if you mention infrastructure, could that also happen to help the capital?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It helps a little bit, but I wouldn't say it's more on the operating cost side than on the capital cost side.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Chris Terry from Deutsche Bank. Sir, you have an open line.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Good morning, guys. Perhaps a question for Laurie. I think Andrew Kaip touched on this a bit earlier, but just digging into the cash flows a little bit further. In that quarter, there was the accounts receivable increase and also the Yanacocha dividend, but you offset some of these by having lower CapEx, from what I understand, in the first quarter and you'd expect the CapEx to go up in the second quarter.","Do \u2013 can we expect some of that accounts receivable to come down again in the second quarter that might offset the CapEx? Just trying to think through the next couple of quarters a bit more on the cash side.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Terry, for that question. We do \u2013 I would expect that accounts receivable to come down. We had unusually high sales compared to production in the first quarter. We had mentioned at the end of last year we had some Batu shipments that did not make it through to sales. And so, we had that come through in the first quarter. But we will be expecting to ramp up some of the capital costs in this quarter. And the Yanacocha dividend, we don't factor that into free cash flow. That was more of a financing activity of moving that through similarly to Regis.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. So, is there any update on how we should think about that Yanacocha dividend going forward?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I don't think that we would be doing that on a regular basis. It's something we want to make sure that we leave enough cash at Yanacocha to fund the upcoming activities in what might be happening. But we felt that there was enough cash there, and we felt it was appropriate to dividend it out to all the partners including to us at corporate, which allows us to use some of that for debt pay-down and things like that.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. Sure. And just on the interest expense, so I think your guidance is down $10 million for the 2016 year, but I think you might have mentioned a $28 million saving from the payback of the debt. Is that just because it's been done partially through the year or what's the \u2013 how do I square that?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Terry. Two things. One, it is partially through the year, but also perhaps the bigger factor is as we've spent \u2013 we're spending a little bit less on capital, so our capitalized interest goes down. Our guidance is expensed. So, we have some that moves to capitalized interest, and that number has gone down so more of it stays in expense.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. And one final one. If Batu was to be sold, what does that mean for cash release, i.e. how much of the current cash balance is set aside for Indonesia at the moment?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's really part of the deal terms that we'd be working through, so I think it's best to hold that question if we're \u2013 for another time.","Chris Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Robert Reynolds from Credit Suisse. Sir, you have an open line.","Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Hi. Good morning, guys. Going back to Batu Hijau again. My question relates to the 17% effective economic interest that Newmont gets through, I believe it was a loan it made to PTPI. And I'm curious how that 17% would be treated in the event of a sale of Batu Hijau. Would Newmont receive proceeds for the 17%, or is there a loan that PTPI would repay to Newmont? Any color there would be helpful.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Good question, but that fits all within the overall elements of the deal terms that we're working through. So, nothing more I can share at this stage.","Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Are you able to provide any color on the size of the loan that was made to PTPI?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I believe that you should be able to find what you need in the disclosure note. Let me get back to you on that. Just \u2013 I'm familiar with the loan balances. I'm just not sure what \u2013 where to point you to, to point that out. So, we'll come back to you on that.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And I don't think it's specifically disclosed in our Q.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. That's it for me.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Karl Blunden from Goldman Sachs. Sir, you have an open line.","Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just also \u2013 another question here on Batu. I know you can't disclose much about the expected size of the proceeds. But I mean, I think it's fair to assume there would be some cash proceeds from the sale if it were to happen. If that happened, how should we think about the use of those proceeds, potentially a mix in your corporate priorities between debt reduction and investing for future production.","And then, I think a follow-up there is, if you were to target debt, do you have a sense of \u2013 you've been balanced between near-term and longer-term debt. I guess, giving some \u2013 giving us a sense that you're focused on the cost of debt take-out, but is there \u2013 would there be any changes in your prioritization of near term versus long term based on your view of the market and liquidity?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the first part of that, and then I'll have Laurie cover the second part in terms of what debt we would target. If we are successful, the cash proceeds we would see being used both to continue to pay down debt as we work towards our net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1 time at a $1,200 gold price and then use proceeds to continue to fund our own organic growth projects. We see we have the best organic growth pipeline in the industry. I wouldn't see accelerating, but use the cash to invest in those projects where they make sense, where they're profitable. In regards to what debt we'd target, I'm going to hand it over to Laurie to cover that.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, Karl, for the question. I think we will definitely continue to target a mix. But as we get closer to some of the near-term debt, we might prioritize that a bit more than what you saw in the tender that we just executed.","Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very, very helpful. Just in terms of the size. Obviously, you can't disclose the size but is it feasible to think that you may be able to achieve your full target debt repayment for the 2016-to-2018 period much sooner than the net window then?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, our targeted debt reduction payment does not rely on these proceeds. That's what we believe we can do from our operating performance. So, obviously, if we did get these proceeds and did use that to pay down debt, we would exceed that number.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And what we've achieved already here in the first quarter has put us on pace to...","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Exactly.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not only meet, but likely exceed that target that we've put out there for the next three years.","Karl Blunden - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fantastic. Thanks for the disclosures, and congrats on a good performance.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Karl.","Operator","We have a question coming from Eliot Glazer from Wm Smith. You have an open line.","Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.","Well, thank you, Gary, for a very thorough report. My question is, in your gold ounces predicted for 2017, 2018 and thereafter, do you include Batu Hijau?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What we have is the Batu Hijau production is in there in 2016, 2017, also 2018, 2019 and 2020. But then, we're processing off the stockpiles. What we've not included is the Phase 7 investment, so that's not in the capital guidance and it's not showing up in the cost. It's primarily capital and the capital range we'd expect is $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion that would begin in 2017, if we are to move forward.","But to do that, just as a reminder, we would need to have our Contract of Work changes defined and agreed, and we would need to have \u2013 as we've done with Phase 6, we need to have third-party financing \u2013 non-recourse project financing that would be set up to do it. And of course, it would have to make economic sense and have the returns to fit in that area. So, those would be the three things.","But back to your key question on guidance, we've not included Phase 7, but it does show Phase 6 through 2016, 2017 and then the processing of \u2013 it's as if it would have been back if you go back and take a look at 2014 and the first part of 2015 in terms of production levels.","Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.","I'm sorry, sir, but I still have a follow-up. According to bloomberg.com, it's likely that you're going to have to sell more than you said so far in exchange for about $2 billion in cash. Are they right? Are they wrong?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I didn't follow the question. Say that again, Eliot?","Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.","According to a number of articles that ran on bloomberg.com, there's an investor group trying to raise $2 billion to buy a larger portion of Batu Hijau than you said in your previous explanation.","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Those numbers \u2013 I can't comment really on what's in the press. I think, when we look at the value, there's a value for Phase 6 and there's a value for Phase 7 out there and beyond. Those would be the pieces that we would be looking at. So, when I talk of the development cost for Phase 7, that doesn't include the revenues and the value we get from Phase 7. And of course, it didn't pick up the value we get for Phase 6 in the equation.","Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.","It was not very thorough. The last question is, are you going to be forced to sell a significant portion at some point by the government of Indonesia?","Gary J. Goldberg - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. The only requirement that we have under our Contract of Work is a further 7% divestment. That has been on the table with an agreement to sell, and the government hasn't progressed that in almost five years that we've had that agreement. So \u2013 but I don't see \u2013 divestment has never been an issue in our discussions with them on the Contract of Work. We've divested already 44% of our interest there, and that has not been an issue with the government.","Eliot Glazer - Wm Smith Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Gary J.

Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other member of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to Slide 2, before I go any further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Meredith and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that Newmont delivered another strong quarter, and I appreciate the opportunity to walk you through the details now. Our operations continued to drive costs down, work more safely and increase gold and copper production compared to the prior year quarter. ","This performance helped us double our operating cash flow, significantly improve adjusted EBITDA, and deliver a nine fold increase in free cash flow compared to last year, despite lower metal prices. ","Our portfolio is also stronger than it was a year ago. We executed value accretive transactions and remained on track with our four development projects in the Americas. We also announced the decision to proceed with our Tanami expansion project in Australia. ","Finally, we strengthened our balance sheet, met our commitment to pay dividends, and repaid $50 million of debt. I\u2019ll turn to slide 4 for more on these achievements. We continue to execute the three elements of our strategy; first, we improved our underlying business by lowering injury rates 15%, decreasing all-in sustaining cost 16%, and increasing gold production 16% quarter-on-quarter. We also tripled capital production. ","Second, we strengthened our portfolio by acquiring Cripple Creek and Victor, and selling assets that represent lower value or higher risk to Newmont. We remain on schedule and on or under budget at Turf Vent Shaft, Merian, and Long Canyon Phase 1. We are also moving forward with the Tanami expansion project, an investment that will increase profitable production and extend mine life at very competitive returns. ","Finally, we created shareholder value by generating $758 million in adjusted EBITDA and $478 million in free cash flow during the third quarter. This allowed us to continue to self-fund our best projects, pay dividends and pay down debt, delivering our strategy starts at the mine phase. ","Turning to slide 5, I visited the team earlier this month and was impressed with our newest operations performance. The team recently reached one year working with zero harm and is delivering exceptional business results. This is the bar we\u2019re setting for all our operations. ","Overall, our total injury rates were 15% lower than the prior year quarter and remained among the lower in the mining industry. This performance is over shadowed however by loss of a contractor working on a tree cutting team in Indonesia. [Hack master Teddy] was stuck in the upper body by a falling tree and recently succumbed to his injuries. Our thoughts are with his family and his colleagues. ","Our work to make our operation safer and more efficient never ends. Turning to our cost performance on slide 6; our gold all-in sustaining cost were $835 per ounce for the quarter, bringing our year-to-date cost to $864 per ounce. This represents a 27% reduction since 2012. ","About half the improvements we achieved in the third quarter are the results of sustainable cost and efficiency improvements across the portfolio and higher productivity in sales at low cost operations. We also benefited from favorable oil price and exchange rates, and some delayed timing in our capital expenditures. ","Turning to production on slide 7; we produced more than 1.3 million attributable ounces of gold during the third quarter. This constitutes 16% more than the prior year quarter and our highest output in the last seven quarters. New product from CC&V offset about two-thirds of the reductions associated with divestments. We also produced 48,000 tonnes of copper mostly as a result of higher grades at Batu Hijau.","I\u2019ll highlight four operations that drove this performance; at Batu Hijau third quarter production reflected higher AISC or grades which we\u2019ll mine through 2017; at Boddington, mine plan and full potential improvement unlock higher grades, and increased mill utilization and recoveries. ","Tanami delivered strong product and on the back of higher grades and improved productivity and also no utilization which were achieved through full potential. And finally, Twin Creeks benefited from improved mill grades and the completion of a plant stripping campaign. Putting it all together, our operations are doing good work to maximize opportunities and mitigate challenges. ","Turning to slide 8; in North America the Turf Vent Shaft remains unscheduled to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter and will be completed below budget. Engineering and mine development also remain on track at Long Canyon, where we continue to expect first production in 2017. You can see the leach pad and other surface facilities in this photo. ","The CC&V integration is also progressing and the operation celebrated 5 million ounces of gold produced last month. Ramp up to full mill capacity is slightly behind schedule and we\u2019ve adjusted our outlook accordingly. We are working out the bugs and the delay is not expected to impact longer term production. ","Turning to South America; Merian remains on budget and on schedule to begin producing in 2016. Construction is just over 40% complete and we\u2019ve stockpiled more than 930,000 tonnes of ore at higher than planned grades. We are also advancing Project Integral, a phased approach to developing Yanacocha\u2019s remaining oxide and sulfide deposits and we\u2019ll have initial findings by mid-2016.","In Africa, we are now operating at full capacity at Grid power and Ahafo\u2019s new generators will be commissioned by year end. We\u2019re also advancing our broader power strategy to secure reliable and affordable supply over the long term. ","In Indonesia, we expect our export permit to be renewed in the near future, and continue to work with the government to finalize amendments to our contract of work. In the meantime we are operating at full capacity and storing concentrate or shipping it to Gresik for processing. ","In Australia we\u2019ve announced that we are moving forward with the Tanami expansion project. Turning to slide 9, since 2012 Tanami has more than doubled its gold production, while cutting cost by about 2\/3rd and significantly improving resource confidence. The Tanami expansion project builds on this trajectory. It involves constructing a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend the mine life. ","The project is the outcome of a detailed review of option to maximize near term cash flow and long term asset value. In the first five years of full production, the expansion will increase Tanami\u2019s average annual gold production by 80,000 ounces, lower all-in sustaining costs by between 5% and 10% and extend mine life by three years. First production is expected in the second half of 2017. ","Adding a second decline will also serve as a platform for exploration drilling to support future expansions. As I mentioned last quarter, we see the potential to double current reserves and resources at comparable grades by expanding the Callie and Auron deposits and developing new discoveries at Federation and Liberator.","We are excited about this project and what the team has done to optimize it. For an investment of between $100 million and $120 million the project provides a return of more than 35% at $1100 gold and more than 25% at gold prices as low as $900 per ounce. ","With that I\u2019ll hand it over to Laurie for an update on our financial results. ","Laurie Brlas","Thanks Gary and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report that Newmont delivered a great quarter with solid financial results. Turning to slide 11, as Gary mentioned, we continue to see cost improvement across the portfolio. Our third quarter gold cost applicable to sales per ounce and gold all-in sustaining cost per ounce were 14% and 16% favorable respectively to the prior year quarter.","With these most recent results, we have maintained our portfolio all-in sustaining cost below a $1000 per ounce for the last five quarters running. Gold product was also strong in the quarter, and was up 16% from the prior year. Despite a 13% decline in the average realized gold price from a year ago, we continue to generate strong earning and robust cash flows. ","Turning to slide 12, during the third quarter, revenue was up 16% and we generated $183 million in cash from continuing operations, an increase of more than 148% from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was up 67% from the prior year due to higher production at Batu Hijau, Boddington, Tanami and Twin Creeks, improved oil prices and exchange rates and ongoing costs and efficiency improvement. ","Consolidate free cash flow was $478 million during the third quarter, as higher sales volume and improved costs offset increased development capital spending at Merian and Long Canyon Phase 1. With these most recent results, our year-to-date free cash flow has grown to $941 million, an amount roughly eight times more than what was generated a year ago. We reported adjusted net income of a $126 million in the third quarter or $0.23 per share, compared to $249 million or $0.50 per share last year. ","Turning to slide 13, we walk through the adjusted net income adjustments, which include a $0.04 per share gain, related to discontinued operations, a $0.10 per share gain related to the TMAC deconsolidation. In the past we\u2019ve fully consolidated TMAC by the fine completion of their IPO that is no longer required for accounting purposes. ","So their results will not be included in our line-by-line numbers going forward and instead will be captured in our equity income line. This gain was on the actual event of deconsolidation and we carved it out for purposes of adjusted net income. It also gave rise to a $0.05 per share gain, resulting from an adjustment to our tax valuation allowances.","In the quarter, we also recognized the $0.07 per share on asset sales, primary our stake in the Valcambi refinery. For adjusted net income purposes we also carved out a $0.04 per share loss related to impairments and loss provisions and a $0.03 per share loss related to restructuring acquisitions costs and other minor items. ","After reconciling for these items, we reported adjusted net income of $126 million or $0.23 per share. We are particularly pleased to note that this number includes $0.02 of accretion from the addition of CC&V to our portfolio for just a short two months. A similar outcome is seen in adjusted EBITDA of $758 million, up 67% from the prior year. It is adjusted for essentially the unusual item. ","Now turning to slide 14, a strong balance sheet provides a competitive advantage and a volatile gold price environment, and we continue to execute on capital priorities designed to safeguard our investment grade ratings. ","At the end of the third quarter, our balance sheet had roughly $3 billion in cash and cash equivalent. In addition, we had about $400 million in marketable securities and a $3 billion revolver that is essentially undrawn. In total that $6.4 billion of liquidity. This and our strong cash flow in 2015 gives us the comfort that we can start and finish our projects without having to take on additional debt to fund them.","During the third quarter, we repaid $50 million of debt towards the PTNNT revolver. This brings our year-to-date total debt payments to $330 million. We expect to pay down further debt later this year and are on track to repay a total of $750 million by year end. As always, further payments will be made in context of the current business and market environment, but our significant cash balance certainly supports our ability to pay off additional debt.","Given our existing cash balances and revolver, we have ample flexibility to execute on our capital priorities and are actively monitoring the gold price in the fixed income market to evaluate our options. We also maintained our dividend in light of our strong cash flow and operating performance. ","As a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities due until 2019, and our current net debt to book capital of 19% is well below the maximum 62.5% covenant on our revolver, which is our only covenant. ","And now turning to slide 15, we are proud that our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of roughly 1.1 is among the lowest in the industry and has continued to improve. We have transformed Newmont\u2019s balance sheet in to one of the strongest in the sector, and our liquidity and cash flow generation separate us from the competition.","We have reduced our net debt by 32% from the prior year quarter, and more importantly we have reduced net debt while also growing our EBITDA which significantly improves our financial flexibility. We remain comfortable with our relative level of debt and maturity profile, and we will continue to examine ways to reduce the absolute debt level and increase the long term strength of our business. ","And now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Laurie. I\u2019ll shift gears now to look at the future turning to slide 17. We expect to end 2015 with attributable gold production at the higher end of our guidance range, which is between 4.7 and 5.1 million ounces and capital production of between 140 and 180 tonnes. ","The changes we are making to our 2015 guidance are two fold; first, we are lowering our outlook for gold all-in sustaining cost 4% to between $880 and $940 per ounce. This reflects strong performance particularly in Asia Pacific and Africa, as well as lower exchange rates in favorable power and diesel prices. ","We expect these costs to rise slightly in the fourth quarter, due to higher exploration and advance project spending, sustaining capital timing and lower grades Yanacocha and Ahafo. Second, we lowered our full year outlook for capital expenditure by about 9% to between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. ","This reduction reflects lower sustaining capital expenditures of between $740 million and $780 million or 13% below previous guidance, gains of cost and efficiency improvements at Yanacocha, Boddington, Batu Hijauj, Ahafo and [Akyem], as well as some timing impacts.","Our improved outlook also reflects lower development capital including $50 million in savings at Merian realized through supply chain improvements, favorable exchange rates and lower commodity prices. This reduction is partially offset by new development capital for the Tanami expansion project. Our project pipeline continues to be one of the strongest in the gold sector. ","Turning to slide 18, our projects focus on profitably extending the life our existing operations or opening perspective new mining districts. Before we reach funding decisions, we scrutinize our approach to each project with a goal to lower initial capital cost, accelerate payback and leverage existing infrastructure. ","Projects that are in the execution phase include the Turf Ven Shaft, which will give us access to between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces of higher grade ore per year and support further expansion at Leeville. Merian which will deliver 400,000 to 500,000 ounces of gold and all-in sustaining cost of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first five years beginning in 2016. ","The Cripple Creek and Victor expansion which includes the new mill leach pad and recovery plant that will be commissioned in the second half of 2016. CC&V will contribute between 350,000 and 400,000 ounces of gold in 2016 and \u201917, and is expected to lower Newmont\u2019s overall cost profile. ","The first phase of Long Canyon which will add between 100,000 and 150,000 of gold production per year and all-in sustaining cost of between $500 and $600 per ounce beginning in 2017 and finally the Tanami expansion project which I touched on earlier. ","Further up the pipeline, we are advancing the Ahafo mill expansion and Subika Underground mine in Ghana. These projects are designed to help offset the impact of lower grades and harder ore. We\u2019ve deferred a decision to proceed with the Ahafo mill expansion until the second half of next year to coincide with our timing on the Subika Underground decision. ","We are also progressing the phase 7 cut back at Batu Hijau, where we are working to secure the stability we need for ongoing investment Quecher Main which is part of the oxide expansion effort at Yanacocha and Northwest Exodus in Nevada, which would extend the current underground operation and add profitable production. ","Turning to exploration on slide 19, exploration is one of our core competencies. About 70% of the gold we are mining in 2015 was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our program focuses on maintaining our existing resource base while preserving options to pursue significant new discoveries. ","We employ rigorous standard to make sure the highest quality ounces are added to our reserve base and we\u2019ve developed a proprietary geologic risk assessment process to improve our ore body confidence. This map shows prospects in Nevada, Peru, Ghana and Australia that we expect to be in production before 2020 and longer term prospects in the US, Ethiopia and the Guiana Shield. ","Turning to slide 20 for a closer look at our underground prospects of Exodus in Nevada. Exodus is a high grade underground ore body that was identified in 2008 with a 300,000 ounce discovery. Through new discoveries at Northwest Exodus in 2011 and Exodus Footwall in 2013, we\u2019ve grown the resource base to 1.2 million ounces to date of which 300,000 ounces have been mined. ","We see the potential to double this figure over the next few years by converting mineral inventory in to reserves and resource and by drilling the remaining half of Exodus\u2019s targeted mineralization. ","Turning to slide 21; Northwest Exodus is located several hundred meters from Exodus. We declared a maiden resource of 700,000 ounces in 2014 and expect to declare our first reserves in early 2016. Compared to our initial Exodus discovery, Northwest Exodus is larger with 50% higher grades. Mineralization remains open on the hanging wall. ","Turning to slide 22; the Exodus Footwall is our latest high grade discovery and is located in different stratigraphies in Exodus and Northwest Exodus. We recently identified mineralization of up to 51 meters at grades of 12.5 grams per tonne and Footwall remains open along strike and at depth. We anticipate declaring first resource at Exodus Footwall in early 2016. While we intend to pursue these opportunities, we are also prepared for ongoing market volatility.","Turning to slide 23; at today\u2019s metal prices we can afford to advance our best projects and exploration projects or prospects, fund our dividends and repay debt. This chart gives you an idea what we might do differently in a prolonged period of lower or higher gold prices. ","Under significant constraints, we would delay stripping campaigns and sustaining capital. We\u2019d complete our current projects and further reduce overhead and exploration cost. As gold price improves, we\u2019ll continue to optimize cost and capital, fund our most profitable projects, accelerate debt repayment and increase dividends in line with our policy. Getting our house in order now allows us to deliver superior margins when gold price recovers. ","Turning to slide 24; we are continuing to make good progress towards our goal to become the world\u2019s most profitable and reliable gold producer. We\u2019ll reach that goal by continuing to deliver our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety, cost, and technical performance to strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower cost asset base, and to create shareholder value by generating cash, paying dividends and strengthening our investment grade balance sheet. ","Thank you for your time. I\u2019d like to open the floor to questions now Operator. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our first question comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. Sir your line is now open. ","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","Just a couple of questions; I suppose you\u2019ve seen obviously the benefits of the tailwinds from the Aussie dollar and oil price falling. Can you just sort of give us some comments on how you would think about going forward with hedging and would you increase your hedging exposure on the cost side. ","Gary Goldberg","Sure Andrew. Historically we\u2019ve had foreign exchange hedges in place in Australia and a little bit New Zealand, of course New Zealand that Waihi is gone away. In Australia we liquidated about 2\/3 of that position back about two years ago, it\u2019s been November of 2013 and we are continuing to draw that down, it runs out. Basically it\u2019s pretty small now and over the next two to three years it is gone but it\u2019s a very small portion. ","We don\u2019t see ourselves changing that hedge position or increasing it quite frankly. We\u2019ve seen a good correlation between gold price in the Aussie dollar not that that drives anything, but we don\u2019t see any need to make a change in our position on the foreign exchange rate hedging. ","When it comes to the diesel fuel, we basically do that in Nevada because of the ability for us to take hedge accounting and we are not taking a position on where the price will go, its\u2019 just we do it in order to try to smooth out what the price swings might be. So we\u2019ve got basically an evergreen type hedge book arrangement there that we continue out over a 2 to 2.5 year period to cover that. But we\u2019re not taking any strong positions on price there either. ","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","I suppose the other one on Indonesia and on Batu. I think in the short term its fallen with the export license, but as far as looking in to sort of \u201916 and I know it\u2019d be nice to know with a crystal ball. But do you think these prices; I mean is there a time that you need to make a decision on this? Obviously with the government and more understanding about what\u2019s happening with mineral process than you\u2019d seen over the last couple of years. ","Gary Goldberg","The way we are looking at it, we need to clearly get the export permit and we expect that here in the next week or two in terms of getting that so we continue to mine through phase 6, and that\u2019s just been part of the process every six months of renewing that. ","In terms of the contract to work, we do need to get those changes nailed down. We agreed those changes a little over a year ago with an MoU with the government and just really need to get that finalized and get the certainty of that as well as get the financing in place like we did to phase 6, get the financing in place to support phase 7. ","So I would expect and the way we\u2019re looking at it, we\u2019ve got over the next year to get that in place, and that\u2019s the timeframe that we\u2019re looking at. ","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","And I suppose the last question is on Carlin. Obviously bounced back through tonnes (inaudible). Obviously the TVS is going help that. Do you we sort of see like getting back to rates that we saw probably this time last year. ","Gary Goldberg","I missed the location that you were saying. Carlin, sorry. But I\u2019m going to ask Chris Robinson to cover that. ","Chris Robinson","Yeah Andrew I think the key there to Carlin is as Gary mentioned earlier is the Turf Vent Shaft is that comes online we see the much higher grade coming out of Leeville which will obviously pump Carlin back up closer to where we\u2019ve been previously. ","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","So high grade and higher tonnes.","Chris Robinson","Yeah, more fixed tonnes but just higher grade that what we are putting through right now. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Bridges with JP Morgan. Sir your line is now open. ","John Bridges - JP Morgan","Just wondered following on from your exploration commentary, how are your geologists thinking about reserves at year-end? What sort of gold price do you think you\u2019ll be using and how do you think the reserves will look at presumably lower gold prices?","Gary Goldberg","We\u2019ll give the detailed update on that in February, when we do the update on reserves and resource at year-end, but we\u2019ve given previous sensitivities out there on what it looks like I\u2019d say $100 lower reserve price, and we\u2019re using currently 1300 for reserves and at 1200. Right now I would expect we\u2019ll probably move to 1200, but I don\u2019t expect just to see as big a swing on the reserves is what we had shown in that sensitivity. ","Really two things helping that, one has been, how we\u2019ve gotten down throughout the organization, and that helps make things economic at lower prices. The other piece has been the wing in the Aussie dollar where we would have seen potentially an impact at Boddington. I wouldn\u2019t expect that we\u2019d see that. ","But we\u2019ll give the details and have the details on that one when we come out with reserves and resource numbers in the beginning of this next year. ","John Bridges - JP Morgan","And there\u2019s a follow-up, Merian, you were coming in the low budget with that project, just wondered if you\u2019re learning with that process and maybe another cost of doing things in this current environment is making you think differently about some of the other projects.","Gary Goldberg","Definitely, I think there\u2019s been some very interesting approaches and good approaches taking to how equipments being assembled offsite, prepare and put together offsite. So that it eases the way we can construct it on-sight. I used the leach cell or tanks that we use for the cyanide leach portion being assembled in sections and then bolted together rather than having to bring a bunch of welders on fabricate those onsite is one simple example of that. ","But the more we can make modules and import things that way, in this particular location its worked out well and that could apply in other areas when I think of, for instance, Ahafo North. It\u2019s down the road another couple of years, but I could see that applying there as well. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Yu with Citi. Sir your line is now open. ","Brian Yu - Citi","I wanted to circle back on the prior question, just about Indonesia and Batu. Gary you mentioned you expect to get the permit next week or two. In an alternate scenario where it doesn\u2019t happen, how long can you keep Batu running and have sufficient onsite storage capacity, and given that like Freeport they do have their export license, are there alternatives such as probably Freeport exporting more concentrate and you guy get maybe a greater share of the smelter just to bridge any kind of timing gap.","Gary Goldberg","Brian, we\u2019re not really connected with Freeport on export permit, theirs a different condition and ours we kind of trail there\u2019s where they had some issues once they got their permit and currency, we\u2019ve had that addressed along the way. So that\u2019s not an issue.","Our biggest pieces just working through some final requirements the government has which is what we went through the last time through this process. We expect very [constant] and we\u2019ll get that. Failing that, we do have about three weeks of capacity left in the concentrate storage barn and if we weren\u2019t to have that then we\u2019d have to look at curtailing production. But I really don\u2019t expect that to happen, given all the things we\u2019re hearing on the ground and the progress that\u2019s been made. ","Brian Yu - Citi","And second question is just on CC&V, you mentioned a little bit of a delay in the mill ramp. Could you provide a little bit detail and then along those lines you are keeping your guidance for next year still, may be in order of magnitude and the way you talked about in terms of weeks or month in terms of slippage when it gets to full run rate. ","Gary Goldberg","Sure thing. I\u2019m going to hand over and ask Chris Robinson to explain what\u2019s going there. ","Chris Robinson","Yeah I think Brian there\u2019s a couple of things that first off we are working through some designs issues that we are confident that we can solve by taking more time. So the ramp up of the actual equipment has taken a bit longer than we would have expected. ","I think the other aspect of it is around ore blending, making some changes around how we mine and feed the plant that we are addressing to get more throughput and maximize the grade through the plant as it was designed for.","And I think the third piece that may be addresses your question longer term is, we\u2019re looking at how to reconfigure that plant with the opportunity to take the concentrate from there rather than leaching it there and the complexities that that brings within the plant, taking that concentrate to Nevada and putting it in either our autoclaves Twin or our roster at Carlin, which is an advantage for both CC&V and absolutely the two Nevada operations. ","Brian Yu - Citi","And then with the design issue, so you\u2019re going handle the concentrate may be a little bit differently. That\u2019s not a CapEx fix?","Chris Robinson","Not if, if we do the reconfiguration that we are looking at, it\u2019s not a significant CapEx issue. The issues we\u2019re dealing with right now are primarily around the back end of the plant, the filtration of both the tails and the con. And that\u2019s where the lower mechanical availability is that\u2019s driving the whole plant. But we\u2019re confident we can fix that, but also with this reconfiguration takes pressure off that part of the plant. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our next question comes from the line of Mr. [John Tremazo with John Tremazo\u2019s (inaudible) Research]. Sir your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","At what point in completion of the construction at Long Canyon and Merian do you think you\u2019ll transition from construction and commissioning to renewed near mine and regional exploration. Both of those I guess are pretty fertile districts. ","Gary Goldberg","It\u2019s a good question John and we quite frankly haven\u2019t stopped our drilling there. We continue to do the drilling at both of those sites to both in-fill around, but also looking in the regions. So at Long Canyon we\u2019re looking not only around the existing Long Canyon, but looking in that region in both Utah and Nevada. Merian, we continue to look for additional (inaudible) light ore in the area around Merian as well. ","So it\u2019s not something we\u2019ve discontinued and it fits within where we continue to look, Brown field and what we\u2019d call wing span areas.","Unidentified Analyst","So it\u2019s possible the reserve or resources with both of those locations could rise this year. ","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, this year and in to next year, and probably more towards the end of \u201916 that we\u2019d be looking to declare something for those.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tanya Jakusconek with Scotia Bank. Ma\u2019am your line is now open. ","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Bank","I think its Scotia Bank. But I have a few questions, one is on CC&V. May be we can have an explanation on the allocation of the purchase the acquisition purchase price to the inventory that really impacted the cash cost and then sort of what are we looking for 2016, because I think the guidance given was significantly higher. I apologies if you addressed this, I just got on the call.","Gary Goldberg","Not to worry Tanya, I\u2019m going to have Laurie talk about those details for both this year and how we\u2019re looking at next year.","Laurie Brlas","No we have not addressed that yet, so thank you very much for the question. We\u2019re still in the process of finalizing the purchase pricing allocation work, and as you know that can have some changes in how things end up with. I would say that as we did the fair value reviews of everything, we\u2019ve allocated a bit less to the stockpiles than you would have seen AGA do as we did fair values on every asset, and sometimes it does result in a different allocation. And that drove the lower prices.","We will give our full \u201916-\u201817 update to guidance at the investor day in December. But I think you can assume that we will come in a bit lower than what we had originally done, but we want to complete that work before we give that information.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Bank","And when you say lower, would that be similar to this 2015 cash cost guidance range in the 560 to 600?","Laurie Brlas","I think what you saw in the third quarter is exceptionally low, I would not expect it to be that lower than what we had originally said, but not as low as what we saw in this quarter. With it just being the first five, it\u2019s not a full quarter period and low volume; you just have some anomalies but it sometimes come through. So I would look for it to be somewhere in between what you saw in this quarter and what we had originally thought it would be. ","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Bank","And then if I have a chance to ask another question, and again I apologize if this has already been asked. Just wanted some more clarification on some of the changes in legislatures that are going on in Peru with respect to water, and what impact that would have on Yanacocha i.e. how do we need to get the mine prepared for these new legislature and sort of costing on this and implications. ","Gary Goldberg","We haven\u2019t covered that yet, but good question, it\u2019s one that we actually have been working for a number of years with the government as they\u2019ve brought forward new regulations and then been working with them on modifying them. They actually rolled out some regulations that exceed by almost 1,000 times what requirements are in most other countries around the world. So trying to get the regulations back to something that\u2019s actually physically achievable on the ground. ","We\u2019ve been making an investment in a water treatment plant there since earlier this year that is scheduled to be completed early next year that will put us on track to meet what we would expect to be the final regulations. So we are still working through that process with the government. ","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Bank","And has it been very cordial in terms of exceeding a thousand times the required regulations and other jurisdictions. Are they pretty amenable to acknowledging that this might be not achievable? ","Gary Goldberg","I think as with any of these things, you have the discussions, you lay out the facts and try to work through what\u2019 the most reasonable approach going forward. ","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Bank","So you think you\u2019re pretty much there, if they come to reasonableness, you are pretty much there, with your water treatment plant coming in early next year there\u2019s nothing else.","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, if we can come to alignment on that, we do believe what we\u2019ve put forward and what we\u2019re constructing there is going to achieve what\u2019s needed going forward. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Gary Goldberg","Operator it doesn\u2019t sound like we have any more. ","Operator","We have one more question coming from the line of Mr. Botier Sharapov with HSBC. Your line is now open. ","Botier Sharapov - HSBC","Just a couple of questions from me. On CC&V I know its early stages and you guys are still working on the (inaudible). Just wanted to get your idea thinking about the mining costs and then y our recoveries there. You mentioned that you could reduce those by 10% and 2% respectively. And I guess with two months under your belt, what\u2019s your current thinking, has it changed since the time you guy acquired the mine?","Gary Goldberg","I think we\u2019re still very confident on what we\u2019ve laid out and positively impressed with some of the things we\u2019ve found. But I\u2019ll ask Chris Robinson to talk about that in a little more detail. ","Chris Robinson","Yeah Gary I\u2019d probably just echo what you said that, we\u2019re still confident that we can achieve those sorts of improvements in the mine as we work through, and then I think as you said its early days, our mine planning folks and technical folks continue to look at it. ","But we\u2019re optimistic that we can do that. I think the other piece of it is, while we talk about the mill, the valley leach is going very well, our teams very confident that we can bring that in on time or a bit ahead of schedule, and comfortable with cost there. ","So while we focus a bit on the mill, the heart of the operation is the valley leach and that\u2019s going very well early stage with our folks coming on and taking that over. ","Botier Sharapov - HSBC","And I guess switching to Batu Hijauj phase 7, I understand you guys are still reviewing it, but maybe you could give us an early indication of what sort of financing that you\u2019ll need for that and maybe strip ratios if possible. ","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, we can layout more details as we run through our guidance for next year. But in general what we did for phase 6, we got non-recourse bank financing that was put in place in rough terms. We\u2019re looking at a total cost for the stripping campaign of around $2 billion and the financing that we currently would see required to be in the $700 million to $800 million range. But that\u2019s sort of a rough ball park. ","Botier Sharapov - HSBC","And I guess in terms of time how long the stripping campaign will take before you guys get in to the higher grade organ?","Gary Goldberg","It would be back out to about 2022, so we are in to the ore body here for \u201916 and \u201917 and then that stripping campaign we don\u2019t get in to the phase 7 ore until 2022.","Operator","There are no further questions at this point. I\u2019d now like to hand the call back to our speaker.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks again for joining our third quarter earnings call this morning. Our team continues to drive stronger performance across the portfolio and the sector, and we are not resting on our laurels. Our goal is to continue improving safety and efficiency at our operations and to continue building a longer life, lower cost portfolio. ","Ultimately, we are working to create the value we need to fund profitable growth, pay down debt and most importantly generate cash for our shareholders. Thanks again and have a safe day.

Thank you, and you may begin.","Meredith H. Bandy - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website, newmont.com.","And now, I will turn it over to Gary on slide 3.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Meredith, and thank you, all, for joining us this morning. Our overarching goal is to create shareholder value over the short, medium and long term. Today, we'll cover what we did to make Newmont a more reliable and profitable business in 2016 and what we're doing to build on that trajectory in the years ahead.","Common themes include running safe operations that meet the highest sustainability standards, applying best practices and technologies to improve costs, investing to strengthen our portfolio and reserve base and generating superior returns.","We'll deliver this performance by continuing to execute our strategy, turning to slide 4. Our strategy is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. In 2016, we improved our business by maintaining low injury rates and no fatalities, reducing gold all-in sustaining costs for the fourth consecutive year and increasing attributable gold production to 4.9 million ounces.","We strengthened our portfolio by building two new mines, Merian and Long Canyon, in two perspective new gold districts; advancing profitable expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor, Tanami and Carlin; adding 10 million higher grade ounces to our reserve and resource base; and selling PTNNT for $920 million in gross cash proceeds. These performance and portfolio improvements helped us create value by doubling free cash flow to $784 million, increasing adjusted EBITDA to $2.4 billion and improving cash on hand to $2.8 billion. We also improved share price by 89% and doubled our dividend payout.","Strong performance starts at our operations, turning to slide 5. I'll point out two milestones that our team reached in 2016. First, we lowered our serious injury rate by 75%. This translated to only 2 serious injuries across our workforce of 28,000 people, good progress but 2 injury is too many. Second, we are rated the top mining company in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year running and recognized with the most improved performance.","This year, we'll continue to lower safety risks, including fatigue, by focusing on improving behaviors and systems. We're providing training to our drivers and installing monitors in our haul trucks to alert them to the onset of fatigue. Our team at Carlin piloted the technology before we invested and reported an 87% decrease in fatigue-related events.","Operational excellence also shows up in our cost performance, turning to slide 6. We have steadily reduced our all-in sustaining costs by a total of 22% since 2012. This include \u2013 excludes PTNNT. Nearly 2\/3 of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements supported by our Full Potential program. Our team has defined and delivered thousands of improvements through Full Potential, and the program is still going strong. We also rely on relevant technology to improve productivity. Automation and analytics are already delivering improvements, and there is more to come.","Turning to our portfolio on slide 7. Comparing our divestments to our investments over the last three years, we've been able to lower unit costs by more than $100 per ounce and double mine life. Divestments culminated in 2016 with the sale of PTNNT for a total value of $1.3 billion. This includes up to $403 million in contingent payments associated with copper price and future development. Our portfolio is now anchored in four key regions, where we have the stability needed to continue investing over time.","Turning to recent investments on slide 8. Last year, we built an even stronger record of delivering profitable projects, when most miners were delaying their capital spend. Our team built the first phase of Long Canyon safely, two months ahead of schedule and $50 million below budget. Taking a phased approach helped us to generate a greater than 26% rate of return and reduced the payback period to about four years.","At Northwest Exodus and Tanami, we advanced extensions that will add profitable production and mine life and serve as platforms for further growth. Both projects are expected to generate returns in excess of 30% at current gold prices.","Merian is another success story, turning to slide 9. We made our first investment in 2004 as a development partner with Alcoa. Since then, our geologists have grown the reserve and resource base to 5 million ounces. The government of Suriname acquired a 25% interest in 2014. More recently, we signed a development agreement with indigenous Pamakkan people. Finally, we delivered the first phase of Merian on schedule and more than $150 million below budget last year, and we continue to see promising exploration results. This is a great example of the type of long-term investments we will continue to pursue.","Turning to slide 10 for more on exploration. In 2016, we added 4.1 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit with particularly strong results at Tanami and Merian, and we improved the reserve grade by 13% through high-grade additions and the sale of PTNNT. These additions helped to partially offset depletion of 6 million ounces and divestment of 2.6 million ounces. We also added 6.1 million ounces to our resource base, including 2 million ounces at our Yanacocha sulfides project, which is showing increasing promise.","In 2017, we expect to boost our exploration and advanced projects expenditure by 22%. About 2\/3 of that increase will pay for more our brownfields and greenfields exploration. About 1\/3 will fund studies for the next-generation projects like Yanacocha sulfides, Long Canyon Phase 2 and the next expansion at Tanami.","Turning to slide 11 for a look at the global business. We ended 2016 with a streamlined portfolio of cash-generating operations, a proven approach to improving costs and productivity and profitable options to expand mature mines and new gold districts in the Americas and to develop extensive underground resources in Africa and Australia. We also ended the year with nearly 3\/4 of our gold reserves in the U.S. and Australia. Finally, our 29% holding in TMAC is not represented on this map or included in our reserves. But I'd like to congratulate Terry and the team at TMAC in Canada who poured their first gold earlier this month.","With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy for financial results on slide 12.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Gary. As many of you know, I joined Newmont late last year. I've been on the job for just over three months and have had the opportunity to visit two of our regions and meet many of our people.","What stands out so far is the commitment to safety that permeates the business and the sense of pride and ownership people take in our performance and future prospects. Newmont is a great place to work, and I'm proud to be a part of the team.","I'll turn now to our fourth quarter financial performance on slide 13. We saw significant improvement in our financial position compared to the prior-year quarter. Gold production rose 17% with increases at most of our operations and new ounces from Merian and Long Canyon.","All-in sustaining cost declined 11% through a continued focus on improving operational effectiveness and cost efficiency, and adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $629 million. We also improved free cash flow by more than 200% to $289 million.","I'll turn to slide 14 to review adjustments to our GAAP net income and EBITDA. Starting at the top, net loss per share, excluding PTNNT, was $0.73 for the fourth quarter. Adjusted net income per share was impacted by three factors.","First, we adjusted out the impairment charge at Yanacocha, which totaled $0.63 per share. As we announced last December, we're completing a comprehensive update of our closure plan at Yanacocha and have increased our cost estimate to cover higher water management requirements. As a result, we increased our reclamation liability and recorded an impairment. We had originally indicated an impairment range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion and came in just below that range at $970 million, as we updated our assumptions.","Second, we adjusted out $0.22 for certain tax items, including the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.","Third, we adjusted out $0.13 related to a book loss on debt repayment and non-cash reclamation expense.","Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.25 per share, up $0.28 from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $629 million reflects the same drivers.","Turning to full year results on slide 15. Strong operational performance drove a 7% increase in attributable gold production and a 2% improvement in AISC year-on-year. This translated to exceptional financial performance, including an 89% increase in adjusted net income to $619 million, a 25% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $2.4 billion and more than doubling our free cash flow to $789 million (sic) [$784 million] (11:12).","Turning to slide 16 and our full year adjustments. Net loss excluding PTNNT was $0.41 per share for 2016. Our full year adjusted net income of $1.16 per share was impacted by two factors. The adjustment for the Yanacocha impairment I discussed earlier totaled $0.63 per share, and adjustments related to valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets totaled $0.94 per share. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 billion for the year reflects impairment and reclamation charges related to Yanacocha closure estimates, loss on debt repayment and reversing a net gain on asset sales, as well as some other items.","Turning to slide 17. As Gary mentioned, performance and portfolio improvements have given us the means to execute our capital priorities, which are to fund profitable growth, maintain industry-leading financial flexibility and return cash to shareholders.","In 2016, we generated $1.1 billion through asset sales and increased our cash on hand to $2.8 billion. Our nearly $6 billion of liquidity includes a $3 billion undrawn revolver and allows us to invest in our best growth options and to pursue opportunistic M&A. We've also reduced our net debt by 2\/3 over the last three years, resulting in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.8 times and making our investment-grade balance sheet one of the strongest in the industry.","Finally, our fourth quarter dividend doubled compared to the prior-year quarter, and we enhanced our dividend policy to improve shareholder returns at the higher gold prices beginning in 2017. We are confident in our ability to generate cash through the cycle, so we also increased the payout at lower gold prices.","Wrapping up my comments on slide 18. Consistently strong performance and a steady focus on value creation continued to differentiate Newmont in 2016. We ended the year with $1.47 in free cash flow per share and an 89% increase in share price, both well above the sector average.","With that, I'll hand the call back to Gary on slide 19.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Nancy. Summing up 2016, we did what we said we would do and delivered sector-leading performance, portfolio improvements and value. We also recognize that we have to continuously improve our record to stay in the lead.","Switching gears now to the future on slide 20. Our five-year outlook calls for steady gold production at competitive costs and ongoing investment in profitable growth. Lower-cost production from our newest mines will partially offset the impacts of inventory adjustments and stripping campaigns at our more mature assets. We also expect to increase spending on the next generation of growth prospects, while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet. Taken together, these factors position us to maintain strong performance over the next decade and beyond.","Turning to our project pipeline on slide 21. Newmont's project pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. This gives us the flexibility to main (14:25) production levels while growing margins and mine life. The projects that are included in our outlook are the current projects and sustaining capital projects you see here. These are the Tanami Expansion and Morrison in Australia, Northwest Exodus and Goldstar in Nevada.","The mid-term projects that will improve our cost and production outlook are shown in green. These include the Ahafo Mill Expansion, Subika Underground and Ahafo North in Ghana, Twin Underground in Nevada and Quecher Main in Peru. With the exception of Ahafo North, we expect to approve these projects during the course of this year. Finally, we continue to invest on our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue.","Turning to slide 22 for the production profile associated with this pipeline. As you can see, Newmont has a stable long-term asset base with considerable upside from its industry-leading project pipeline. Our gold production profile is forecast to remain at about 5 million ounces for the foreseeable future, and we continue to advance our mid-term and long-term projects to sustain profitable production in the outer years. We've provided a seven-year view here in keeping with our focus on long-term value creation, and we believe this outlook differentiates us from our competitors. Let me reiterate that when we talk about growth, we are referring to growing margins, not ounces.","Our work to develop a portfolio of lower-cost, longer-life assets and to generate industry-leading return on capital employed is paying off, and we will continue this trajectory by taking a fit-for-purpose approach to developing our projects, weighing multiple options to improve risk and return, delivering projects safely on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget and continuing to invest in early-stage and exploration opportunities.","Turning to slide 23 for more on our guidance. Our current three-year to five-year outlook is for steady production of 4.5 million ounces to 5 million ounces, unchanged from prior guidance. In 2017, we expect gold production to increase to between 4.9 million ounces and 5.4 million ounces, as the full year production for Merian and Long Canyon more than offset lower production at Twin Creeks and Yanacocha.","In 2018, production will decline slightly to between 4.6 million ounces and 5.1 million ounces due to higher stripping at Boddington and lower grades at Cripple Creek & Victor, Twin Creeks and Akyem. Both Boddington and Twin Creeks will return to higher production in 2020.","Our all-in sustaining cost outlook for 2017 and 2018 is slightly higher, primarily due to recent events but we continue to manage. First, we're working to recover ounces that were impacted by a larger slip in Carlin Silverstar mine in late November. We've taken that production out of guidance for now, and it represents upside for 2018 and 2019. The guidance also reflects the work we've done to fine-tune ground control plans at Leeville.","Second, we adjusted our outlook to reflect the impact of record rainfall we've been experiencing at Tanami. The team is implementing recovery plans now. Third, we shifted the allocation of our cost between copper and gold production, starting in 2017. And finally, our increased investment in advanced projects and exploration will raise cost in the near term, as we continue to invest in our ability to generate superior value over time.","Our cost outlook for 2019 through 2021 remains between $880 and $980 per ounce. Our sustaining capital spend reflects ongoing investment in our asset base and is expected to rise slightly in 2017 in keeping with prior guidance. This capital will mainly fund the ongoing mine development, tailing storage capacity and equipment rebuilds. Longer term, we expect to hold sustaining capital to between $600 million and $700 million per year, which is favorable to previous guidance due to a mix of sustainable cost savings and deferrals.","Development capital outlook for 2017 and 2018 supports our current growth projects. Our guidance does not include projects, unless all studies are complete and full funds are committed. We believe this aligns with how our shareholders think about their investments as well. Our outlook will improve, as we add mid-term projects over the next three years and our longer-term projects thereafter.","Likewise, we do not include Full Potential savings past 2017 in our outlook. For the last four years, we've more than offset the impacts of inflation through Full Potential, and we expect this trend to continue. As always, we take a realistic approach to guidance to drive the right focus within Newmont.","With that high-level overview, I'll turn it over to Tom on slide 24 for more details on our regional performance and outlook.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary. And I'll start with North America on slide 25. In November 2016, we reached commercial production at Long Canyon, two months ahead of schedule and 20% favorable to budget. We also met our investment case and completed expansions at Cripple Creek & Victor. We improved mill throughput and recoveries in 2016 and expect to further optimize performance through our Full Potential program. And at Carlin, we're funding a profitable extension of our Exodus mine that will reach full production in 2018.","As Gary mentioned, we experienced another slip at the Silverstar mine late last year. This prevented us from mining the last ore from this pit in 2016, as expected. We had planned to process some of this ore in the early part of 2017, but have taken those ounces out of guidance for now. This represents upside for 2018 and 2019, as we work through plans to reenter this mine.","Also, we continue to make good progress at Leeville. The work we've done to refine our ground control management plans and change our mining method in some areas has been incorporated into our guidance for Carlin. For the North America region, we expect higher production in 2017, as the full year of operations at Long Canyon offset the impact of stripping and processing stockpiles at Twin Creeks. In 2019, you can see the impact of processing stockpiles as we work through stripping campaigns at both Carlin and Twin Creeks. Both sites return to high production levels in 2020.","It's also worth noting that we'll continue to see seasonal impacts with Carlin, with production weighted to the second half of the year. Long Canyon is ramping up steadily from its first gold pour in November and its production will also be weighted to the second half of 2017. Finally, we expect to reach a decision on our Twin Creeks Underground mine later this year.","Turning to South America on slide 26. We commissioned Merian last October on time and 20% below budget. Merian's lower cost ounces have partially offset declining production at Yanacocha. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha through potential development of the Quecher Main deposit, which could sustain oxide gold production through to 2025. This project is not included in our current guidance, and we expect to reach a decision to move forward later this year.","As Gary indicated, we're also advancing our sulfide study at Yanacocha and declared a first resource of 2 million ounces in 2016. Project economics and technical viability continue to improve as we advance work in the Chaquicocha exploration decline and on autoclave testing to optimize our approach to mining and processing sulfide ores. We also continue to evaluate and refine our closure estimates and approach in Peru, whilst preserving optionality for future development.","South America production is expected to increase slightly over the next two years, as we hit our stride at Merian. In 2019, you can see the impacts of declining production at Yanacocha and higher stripping at Merian. Costs are projected to remain relatively stable over the next three years. And Full Potential, which we'll launch at Merian this year, represents further upside.","Finally, Dean Gehring, an experienced mining leader who joined the Newmont team on June 1 to run our South American business. Dean succeeds Trent Tempel, who is retiring after 33 years of distinguished service with Newmont.","Turning to Australia on slide 27. Our team delivered exceptional performance in 2016, driven by record throughput at Boddington and KCGM and strong results at Tanami, as they continue to advance their expansion projects. This project adds a second decline to support a step-change in mining rates and build incremental plant capacity to match those rights and improve recoveries.","The second decline is in use, and the mill expansion is under construction. As Gary mentioned earlier, progress has been impacted by two months of record rainfall in the Northern part of the Australia, but we remain on track for completion into mid-2017.","Turning to the regional outlook. We'll come off record production at Boddington over the next three years, as we move into the next layback. This will impact production and costs before they return to prior levels in 2020.","The team expects to improve this outlook through Full Potential and by optimizing the Tanami Expansion Project. We added 1.6 million ounces of reserves at Tanami in 2016, bringing total reserves and resources to 5.6 million ounces. Our outlook also includes increased study cost to advance a promising second expansion at Tanami.","Turning to Africa on slide 28. Ahafo and Akyem achieved steady mill throughput and recovery improvements in 2016 and delivered our lowest regional injury rate. Ghana recently elected a new president, and we're encouraged by his willingness to engage and support mining investment. We continue to see Ghana as a good place to do business, and we're making progress on securing the permits we need to expand the mill at Ahafo and build the Subika Underground.","When approved, the two projects will add between 225,000 ounces and 300,000 ounces of gold annually and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. As Gary indicated, we expect to reach a decision in the first half of 2017. Both projects represent upside to our current guidance. Otherwise, we expect production to decrease and cost to increase in 2017 and 2018, as you reach harder ore and deplete high-grade stockpiles at Akyem. In 2019, production and cost are forecasted to improve as we reach high-grade ore at Ahafo.","With that, I'll hand it back to Gary on slide 29.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tom. We continue to make Newmont a safer and more profitable business in 2016 with differentiated cash flow, financial strengths and growth prospects. We delivered industry-leading safety and sustainability performance at our operations and increased adjusted EBITDA by 25% to $2.4 billion and more than doubled free cash flow to nearly $800 million on the back of superior operational performance. We invested these proceeds back into the business by building two new mines and profitable expansions in the Americas and Australia and adding higher grade ounces to our reserve base.","We optimized our portfolio with the sale of our PTNNT stake for $920 million in cash proceeds and we used these proceeds to retire more than $1.3 billion in debt, improving our liquidity and doubling our dividends.","Looking ahead, we can't control the gold price, but we can and will work to outperform the gold sector by continuing to meet our challenges head-on and consistently delivering high quality business results, developing profitable projects on or ahead of schedule and at or below budget, investing in exploration to expand our existing assets and develop the next world-class gold mines and maintaining a strong balance sheet.","Our ultimate goal is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. We entered 2017 from a position of strength, but we recognized that leadership requires us to consistently meet or exceed our commitments and your expectations.","Thank you for your time. I'll turn the call back now to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Andrew Quail, Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Gary and team, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question, and congrats on a strong quarter. One is on \u2013 Gary, one is on the projects. First one, I suppose, with the Yanacocha and Quecher Main, can you just tell us how this ties in to what you guys are doing there with the impairment that you guys talked this quarter?","And also, maybe, I think Tom was touching on the closure costs. What's actually the current provision there for the reclamation? And I suppose, is this an asset that, when you look forward, if you don't go ahead with something like Quecher Main \u2013 I mean, the second half of 2017, is this an asset that you would look to divest?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Okay. A couple of different questions in there. Thanks, Andrew. First of all, on Quecher Main, Quecher Main is an incremental oxide expansion that adds about 200,000 ounces per year of production. Total production, starting from after we approve it, basically gets us from 2019 through 2025. So, it's incremental. And really, the way I've been looking at it, it's a bridge to the development of the bridge to the development of the Yanacocha sulfide. So, it allows us to finish the study work through really the next two-and-a-half, three years on the Yanacocha sulfide, so we're in a position to make an investment decision there.","The closure cost estimates are \u2013 really, it's an update, primarily water related in terms of the increase to the cost that we've estimated. It does not, at this stage, include Quecher Main either the additional costs that we might incur by operating Quecher Main or the benefit we get by extending the reclamation time. So, that would be something we'd have to update, as we'd approve that project.","Same thing with the Yanacocha sulfides. The Yanacocha sulfides both have an impact on reclamation cost, but it also \u2013 not only in terms of adding to that, but also would extend when they would occur, so it pushes it out. None of that is included. So, right now, we've just assumed end of mine life at the end of 2019 and all those reclamation costs, and that's why you see some of Yanacocha's costs going up here over the next couple of years, as those additional reclamation costs flowing through to our all-in sustaining costs.","In terms of divestiture, your last question, I had a very good meeting with the President when I was down in November. I'm encouraged by the approach he's taking and the approach not just for the country but within the regions and the support and focus that he's placing on regional economies and the importance there. The Cajamarca Province is one that has not benefited as much by the presence of mining, and I think changing things there is important.","I'm encouraged by not only Quecher Main, but the Yanacocha sulfides project. And the way that's starting to shape up, it shows really good promise. So, from my standpoint, it's one that we really see good potential in and want to see that full potential through.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the impairment this quarter was related to what exactly?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","It's a combination of additional \u2013 well, we had \u2013 we changed the reclamation cost provision and that was primarily due to changes in our view on how we'd have to manage and treat water. That triggered an impairment to our carrying value, so the $920 million...","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Got it. Okay...","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Essentially was triggered by that.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And the last one is obviously in Africa in Ghana. What would be the final hurdle that you guys have to get over the line to sort of \u2013 to approve Subika and Ahafo together? Is it sort of permitting? Or it's obviously \u2013 well, it doesn't look like it's economics, given your balance sheet is so strong. Is it \u2013 can you just walk us through the final steps?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure thing. And I had the opportunity, and we have a new president in Ghana as well, who was inaugurated in January, and I had the opportunity to meet with him earlier this month. And I came away encouraged about the focus that he's taking on looking to grow businesses in Ghana, talked to him about our history and where the future potential is. We're working through with the local regulators, getting permits for Subika Underground. I think we're making good progress on that and also making good progress in regards to the mill expansion on the requirements around tailings dam construction.","And I think the thing that I've seen in Ghana, which isn't surprising given some of the more broadly publicized issues with tailings dams, there's more focus on the construction. I think we do a good job with that at all of our operations, but we're taking the right time to make sure regulators and other stakeholders are comfortable with what's going on. So, that's taking a little bit more time.","I believe we're in a position here in the first half of this year to get those permit approvals in alignment with what's required to take the next steps. The economics look good on both of these projects. We've done really good development work with Subika Underground. So, that sits in a better place to see earlier first production. And then, the mill expansion is a simple expansion, primarily the grinding capacity and crushing capacity at Ahafo. So, there's not new technology or anything going in. So, they're really good additions to the portfolio there.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, mate. We've got a new president in the U.S. Have you met him?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Nope, haven't met him yet, and we're paying attention to what he brings along the way.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. Good. Okay. Thanks, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","The next question comes from John Bridges, JPMC. Your line is now open.","John D. Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, Gary, Nancy, Meredith. Congratulations on the results. Just digging a bit deeper into the sulfide project, what's your vision for that? What are you going to be doing in the next couple of years as you study it? What could it be? What could it cost?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think we'll have more information to update the market later this year in terms of some of the details. At a high level, it's looking to \u2013 we've been doing the testing of the Yanacocha Verde, the bioleaching of copper. That's showing very promising results. The next phase there is to look at a thiocyanate leach to leach gold from that after we've leached the copper. So, that's the next stage of that testing going on. But so far, that looks good.","We continue to do work with the Chaquicocha Underground development. We've had good exploration results. We're looking at a potential to actually extend that decline and do some additional drilling. And that could help and actually provide even a bridge that we haven't talked a lot about, but an incremental that might be able to come out in advance of the overall Yanacocha sulfides projects. But we've got to do a little more drilling on that.","The third piece is we would produce a copper gold sulfide concentrate with high arsenic. We've done a lot of metallurgical testing, both with the atmospheric leach process we continue to test with Buenaventura, but also testing the autoclave process. Results there are showing really good recoveries of both copper and gold, so I'm encouraged. That's part of the encouragement I've seen and we've also seen some early results that maybe the capital wouldn't be quite as much as what we thought, but I'm going to hold and wait until later this year to provide an update when we get to the next stage on that project.","So, it's really how we take the next stage. We've added several million ounces to resource here, I think 1 point \u2013 or about 2 million ounces to the resource base based on this work that we've done and additional drilling we've done.","Anything else, John? Did we lose John? Have we lost the line, operator?","Operator","Apparently Mr. John has lost the connection.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Okay.","Operator","We do have our next question coming from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Gary. Jorge Beristain with DB. My question was circling back on Africa again and just to dig a little bit deeper as to what has actually been the holdup with getting Ahafo and Subika going. We know that there was some tax issues about 18 months ago, but we thought that you had kind of jumped ahead of those versus your peers, settling with the government. And then, we've had recently some tailings \u2013 increased tailings risks globally. But could you just comment on what has kind of held up getting the green light so far?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think, Jorge, it really boils down to just working through the permit time \u2013 the permits on the underground. With that, it's the impact \u2013 what the concern was the impact on the groundwater table when you go down deeper, what is the impact on the surrounding communities. So, we had to work through in our groundwater models and show what the impact is. We think we've got a good handle on that and the regulators I think now believe we've got a good handle on that. So, getting that outlined was probably the big factor in the delay in getting that permit through.","And the other point that you make in regards to tailings dams was just getting comfortable around what tailings dam construction method to use at Ahafo for the next stage of expansion. So, we've been working through with the regulators on that.","In terms of the tax issues, or more specifically, the investment agreement, we actually negotiated for over two years changes to our investment agreement that allowed for increases in some of the royalty rates. I think it was a good process, from what I've seen there, versus other places in the world, where we worked with government folks and came up with a new agreement and actually had that then ratified by the parliament. So, that's in place and has had approval here. That was just a little bit over a year ago, towards the end of 2015 that that was approved. So, that's in place and gives us the assurances and stability and confidence that we need to go forward with these investments, once we get these permits confirmed.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then, just on South America, I just wanted to check. Your unit costs, particularly for AISC, are not coming down as quickly as what we're seeing in the peers \u2013 or in your peer group. And so, the question is, is that because you've had some of the changes to the expected impairments down there and that's kind of taxing your AISC higher than your peers and that's something that you said may be reversible...","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think the key reason \u2013 and you're looking at Yanacocha. Let's set Merian aside because I think Merian is performing really well as a new operation, as you would expect from a new operation like that. At Yanacocha, it's more we're coming to the end of the mine life and production declines and some of the inefficiencies you get around that as it declines until we looked for these incremental expansions.","We also have a small layback going on there that doesn't get into the higher grade parts of the ore body for another year and a half, two years, so you're seeing some of those costs come through. So, it's not unexpected at this stage in the mine life to see the costs on that operation go up.","Operator, I think we lost Jorge as well. Operator, can we go to the next caller?","Operator","The next question comes from Evan Kurtz, Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, Gary. I guess, I'll ask one before I fall off. So, the \u2013 my question is just on Silverstar. So, if you were to put that back in the numbers, say, in 2018 and 2019, what sort of impact would that have from both a volume aspect and a cost aspect? Well, how costly are those ounces? And what is kind of the likelihood and the cost of actually doing what you need to do to get that mine back in operation and finish off those ounces?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Evan. I'm going to have Tom address that question. It's something that's still under study, but I'll have him cover it.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary, and thanks for the question, Evan. First step for us is to step back and assess the nature of the slip, do some geotechnical drilling to understand how we need to update our structural models and then reassess what would be involved in doing some work on that high wall and removing the slip material then going back in, and we really need to go through that considered process over the, really, the first half or so of this year to make an assessment of what going back in looks like, then I think we're in a position to start to give some information in terms of what impact that would have in the longer term. But for us, at the moment, it's really about just taking that step back and having a considered assessment of what we need to do to get back into that pit.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And how many ounces were left in there at this point? Is that something you can flag?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. It's the order of around 200,000 recovered ounces still in that \u2013 bottom of that pit. So, we were really right at the end of that mine.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then, since I'm still on, maybe I'll ask one more. Is there any update on KCGM?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Nothing to add from our standpoint. I think we continue to operate that mine, and it's doing what we expect it do in terms of operating performance. In terms of the process, we'll watch and we'll see what happens.","Evan L. Kurtz - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. I'll hand it over.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Evan","Operator","Our next question comes from David Haughton, Imperial Bank of Commerce. Your line is now open.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary and team. Thank you for the update. Just a question on Ahafo North, if I may. I see that it's got the green status on your pipeline. Can you just give us an update on what you're thinking there as a standalone project or a satellite to Ahafo, kind of, CapEx, timing, et cetera?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think what we're seeing with Ahafo North, it's probably another three years or so down the road before it comes forward for an investment decision. We're doing more work drilling-wise, doing more work with the community to make sure we've got the right approach there, kind of, leveraging off the good work we've done, I think, both at Ahafo and Akyem community-wise.","Initially, there were talks whether we could mine the ore there and haul it down into the Ahafo Mill. It's really looking like the better option would be to have a standalone mill up at Ahafo North to process that ore. And then, we take the loaded carbon, much like we're doing at Long Canyon, where we take the loaded carbon from Long Canyon into Carlin, we take the loaded carbon from Ahafo North down to Ahafo for final processing into dor\u00e9.","So, doing more work there, doing more work on some drilling and, particularly, grade estimation drilling there to make sure we get a good handle like we did with some of our other projects, Merian and Long Canyon, wanting to make sure we've got a good handle on the grade in those first few years. It makes for a little additional cost, but sure helps on the certainty side. So, we're continuing to work through that.","In terms of capital, I mean, it's early days. So, I think let's get through and see where we finally land, but I would see it as something probably less than what we spend at Merian, given some of the other infrastructure that's around, but let's wait and see. I think, production-wise, we're probably talking something in the 200,000 million ounce to 250,000 million ounce a year range at this time. So, that gives you some high level.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Yeah. That's excellent. Thank you, Gary. Just looking at Tanami now, reserves have grown once again, exploration seems to be very kind to you, that's a very rich area. Moving on to the expansion beyond now \u2013 I know this latest one isn't even delivered yet and I'm talking about the next. Is that contingent upon more exploration, or do you see that there is enough material underground to warrant the next step beyond where we are already?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. From my standpoint, I \u2013 we're looking at a variety of different options, whether it's additional declines, a production shaft and different options in how we mine. The resource and reserve continues to grow there, as you pointed out. So, we'll continue to do drilling. We're out of there right now because of the rain and the limits that's had on getting into both of the mine because we don't the fuel to operate the mine. So, we've just gone to standby here for the next \u2013 hopefully just next week or so. But I'm encouraged by the potential for this.","You will remember, five years ago, we had a project to put in a production shaft, which we put on hold because the mine wasn't performing and delivering the results it needed to. So, we've taken sort of that back off the shelf, clustered it off, but also looked at different places to put it because the ore body has grown quite a bit. And how big you make the shaft, how deep it goes, those are some of the different options that are being looked at here.","But for me, I think it's a good next stage. But like you say, we've got to deliver the current expansion. We've got the mining part done, the mill part done here mid-year and make sure we know how that delivers, so we can design what would be an incremental mine expansion and another incremental mill expansion.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","One last question and probably for Nancy. Just very significant cash balance. I know that Newmont has carried quite a bit of cash over the last few years. $2.8 billion thereabout seems like a sizeable balance, and I'm just wondering what your thought process was as to how much to keep and how much to use to retire debt.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. We have done a lot in this year in terms of retiring our debt, and I think the main focus here is to retain our optionality and have a lot of financial flexibility regardless of what opportunity is in front of us. So, we'll continue to grow the business, invest in our longer-term opportunities and then also stay alert and aware for M&A, as it may present itself.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, you're just keeping your powder dry, basically?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Exactly.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Your line is now open.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you for taking my question. I may be a little hazy in my memory. But when Fronteer Gold was promoting Long Canyon, they were looking at a bigger than 1 million ounce deposit that was open, and there had been no indication yet of hitting the sulfides. And the mine plan \u2013 and congratulations for pouring gold and making a little profit. Just for a 1-million ounce deposit and the mining rate for ore is something like 6,000 tons a day and weighs to something like 125,000 ton to 175,000 ton a day or 20 to 30 strip. Could you explain a little bit about the depth of the ore, topography constraints, water constraints? It appears that the project definition is more complicated than some of the broad expectations of five years ago.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","John, thanks for the question, and I think a couple of things. We've got about 1.2 million ounces, so we've grown the reserve from where we were when we first announced the project. We continue to do drilling around the deposit and finding \u2013 and really haven't closed it off in terms of extensions at depth and down dip, finding higher grades. It goes below the water table at that point. So, how we manage mining below the water table is one of the things we'll be studying as part of Long Canyon Phase 2, the next phase of the project, so we're doing work on that.","In terms of current mining rates and strip ratios, you've got a lot higher numbers than what we're actually doing and maybe you've got something tied in when we were doing development and not reflective of what we're seeing more steady state. Strip ratio ranges anywhere between about 8 and 10 here over the next several years. So, higher strip ratio, but also higher grade than average \u2013 we get average grades, so that \u2013 it's around the ore body average of 1.9 grams per ton.","John C. Tumazos - John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC","Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kit Keane (49:44), S&P Global.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up on that \u2013 on John's question. If you looked at Long Canyon in terms of the acquisition cost, when would you expect a payback on the projects, how many years would it take?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think, at this stage, it doesn't happen with Phase 1. Clearly, it would be something that would happen out at Phase 3, which would be most likely an underground and a mill complex being installed there in terms of fully paying back the acquisition cost.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thanks for that. And, yeah, just having recently been on the Barrick call and they mentioned some of their ongoing discussions with potential buyers on Kalgoorlie, is there anything you can add on your view of the asset there?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","We like the asset. We like operating it, and we're watching the process to see where it comes out.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. Fair enough. And longer term \u2013 or just in terms of M&A, you had mentioned you're obviously always watching the market. Maybe you could \u2013 is there anything that you particularly like out there that \u2013 any jurisdiction that you particularly like in terms of M&A right now?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think we've got a good footprint around the globe, in areas where we have good operating capabilities and good relations. I think, when you look at what we provided here today in terms of a seven-year outlook and what are our production profile looks like, we can be opportunistic.","And as we were with Cripple Creek & Victor at a time when prices were down and people needed the cash and we were able to acquire an asset for good value, we'll always look to see if there's things we can do to improve our portfolio quality in terms of either value or risk. But we've got a really excellent project pipeline that does those things today. We'll continue to probably more focus on early-stage developments, greenfield sort of things or brownfield in areas and in jurisdictions that we're comfortable we can manage well. And so, we'll keep our eyes focused on those sorts of things.","Unknown Speaker","Final question. I appreciate that. In terms of \u2013 one of the first questions that was asked about the new administration, obviously, Scott Pruitt was just \u2013 he's now the administrator of the EPA and there are some changes expected there. Obviously, it's early days and we can't say for sure what's going to happen at the EPA. But just in terms of Nevada and perhaps in the U.S. in general, do you feel like there will be some benefits in terms of permitting timelines? I'm just kind of looking for a general comment on how you see that changing. For example, if the Waters of the U.S. rule, which obviously isn't enacted fully yet, goes to the wayside, would that benefit you in Nevada? Or just some commentary there.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Thank you for that. I think we're all, kind of, watching the different things coming from the administration. I saw some comments that Mr. Pruitt made yesterday in particular that I liked about having investor certainty. If there's going to be changes to regulations, having a good process for review and understanding of how those properly get implemented is a good thing, I think, for business overall in the U.S.","As it affects us directly, I think we already sat in a pretty good spot in terms of how we'd work with regulators. We came up with a sagebrush ecosystem program at the end of last year with the outgoing administration that really helped to address some of the concerns around sage-grouse and other species that are potentially at risk in Nevada and how we would work with the different administrative groups to be able to continue and really not impact our operations.","So, I think we sat in a pretty good spot already, but we want to work with the incoming administration. I'm looking to set up a meeting with Mr. Pruitt just to have that sort of discussion around where we have concerns and where we could see logical changes going forward to any process that take into account not just our concerns but all stakeholder concerns going forward and do it in a proper manner.","Unknown Speaker","I'll beg off in just a second, but just can you add to that, what would be the primary concerns for you? What would be the things that you would raise with Mr. Pruitt?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I look at some of the things that had been getting implemented around reclamation bonding, where federal or state jurisdictions already have things in place so we don't have overlap of requirements which is one of the things we come across today. Those are probably a couple of things that I would focus on.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Robert Reynolds, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Good morning, guys. My question is on Merian. You added about 600,000 ounces to reserve there. Is that mostly in the oxide or sulfide? Or can you talk about how that could impact the mine plan?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think it's almost all oxide. We don't really \u2013 well, we have sulfide there. It doesn't change the processing method. It's still the leaching process there. I've got our Head of Exploration here, Grigore Simon. He can add to that.","Grigore Simon - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. So, the 600,000 ounces are the Newmont equity ounces that Gary mentioned. They're a combination of ounces coming from the extensions of the pit as well as the success that we had in the lower part of the pit. So, the ounces are a bit of a combination of oxide ounces, of course, the extensions, and in the deeper part of the pit then will be the sulfide ounces.","Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. And then, in your cost outlook, I think it mentions around 2019 there's higher stripping at Merian. Could you just talk about what your strip ratio is expected to be in 2017 and then what the life of mine strip ratio is at that asset?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Okay. I'm going to hand that one over to Tom Palmer to handle.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. So the strip ratio will be around 3.5 to 4 on average through those years, and that also represents about the life of mine strip ratio as well.","Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. And then you might have touched on it earlier but at Long Canyon, there is a higher grade resource there. It's about 3.5 gram per tonne out of (56:53) 1.6 million ounces. Is that material that can only be accessed with a Phase 2, or could you mine some of that in Phase 1?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","That would be Phase 2 and looking going below the water table to access that.","Robert Reynolds - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Okay. That's it for me. Thanks.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Robert.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Barnes, TD Securities. Your line is now open.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Gary, I believe the JV with Barrick at Turquoise Ridge expires this year. What is the plan there?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","No, the JV doesn't expire. We have a processing agreement that we process the ore from Turquoise Ridge at our Twin Creeks mill. And at the end of this year, that's scheduled to be up. So that's what's changing this year there.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","And what is going to happen with the processing agreement?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's something that we'll work out with our joint venture partner.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","And secondly then on CapEx, if you do approve all of the projects this year that you're talking about, would CapEx be up this year and next by $200 million in each year, it's something in that order?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. We'll provide \u2013 when we approve those projects, we'll update our development capital. But when you look at just the two projects in Ghana, that's roughly about what the impact would be for additional capital in 2017 and 2018. But we'll provide that update along with the other projects as we approve them.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Dudas of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, Gary. Just quickly, your thoughts on exploration opportunities with much of your near-mine site drilling and what we could look for maybe this time next year.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","We continue, obviously, to focus a majority of our spend in the brownfield, so around our existing operations and areas where we've talked about. Greenfields, we're working in places in Eastern Nevada, Western Utah, down in Peru, around the Guiana Shield areas in the northern part of South America, in Ethiopia and also Mount Isa in Queensland in Australia. So \u2013 and as we said, upping our spend both on exploration and advanced project spend, really looking not for what we need here in the next three to five years, but looking at the next five to 10 years what's important for the business.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just following up on your thoughts on the EPA and such. Geologics aside, does the U.S. may become a better, more attractive place to mine for over the next four to six, seven years given what changes could possibly occur?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think we still look long term for all these sorts of things when there's different administrations, whether it's here or in other countries and still look to invest where it makes sense for the long term.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","As long as they don't change the mining law, I guess that will be helpful. Thanks, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaip, BMO.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi, Gary, Nancy and Tom. Thanks very much for taking my questions. I've got a couple. One, the sustaining capital, you made a remark that sustaining capital had come down in 2017 timeframe because of savings as well as deferrals. And I'm just wondering if you can expand a bit on those two items. What were the drivers of those changes?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Okay. I'm going to have Tom Palmer cover that.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","I'll give you maybe two examples, Andrew. In terms of savings, a lot of our sustaining capital goes into tailings facilities. At say for instance Boddington, which is a very large operation, low-grade mine, obviously we generate a lot of tailings, we've got better contract rates for building our tailings extensions. So you get savings by building some of those, still constructing the same amount of tailings, but you're getting them at a cheaper rate. So starting to build some of that into our plans going forward.","And then there are other things we do. Another example would be Cripple Creek & Victor where we have optimized our mine plans, and some of the equipment that we thought we needed to buy, we can now defer into future years. So, that's an example of deferrals that are reflecting in our sustaining capital going forward.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thanks. That provides a better understanding. And within that, there's really no \u2013 I mean, is there a component of deferral of stripping programs, that CapEx is inevitably going to have to show up in later years or was it mostly restricted to equipment and improved contracting rates and improved cost?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","As you say, Andrew, it's more about the latter. It's improved rates, improved unit costs, deferral where we have done mine and plan optimization. And as we talked about today, we are \u2013 got some maturing operations and we are moving into those stripping campaigns and talking about it. So, we continue to do those campaigns for the longer term. So, we're not pushing any of that stuff out.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thanks very much. At Long Canyon, it strikes me that the grade \u2013 I mean, grade from a heap leach perspective is already very attractive. And I'm just wondering, as you move towards permitting below the water table, is the move to \u2013 and you're looking at the prospects of higher grade resources to convert to reserves. Is the move in Phase 2 really towards permitting a milling complex sooner rather than later?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. What we need to do is get the reserve and resource figured out, the elements of the water and how we're going to manage it so that we can put together our overall permit requirements for both the mill and expansion of the leach. We haven't firmed up, but it automatically goes to a mill. I think economics may drive it that way, but we need to do the study work on it. So, at this stage, because we've got Phase 1 in place, we want to be very methodical in our review and make sure we bring the permit along at the right time in the process.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Great. And then, just finally, on another exploration project, Sabajo, and now that you're operating in Suriname, I'm just wondering \u2013 and you're looking at acquiring additional ground at Sabajo. Is there an update that you can provide on those activities?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Sabajo is actually \u2013 it's about 40 kilometers west of Merian and the way, at least, we're assessing it today is as a satellite ore body that could feed ore to the mill at Merian. It provides some additional saprolite ore that we could truck over. So, we're setting options on how we could truck it and when the right timeframe is for that. It's probably not going to add to Merian until the 2020-2021 timeframe based on what we know today, but it's still early days. We're just moving that project in our project pipeline along to the next stage. So, it's still early days to know the details on it.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Our final question comes from Tanya Jakusconek, Scotiabank. Your line is now open.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","Great. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my question. Actually, I have a couple. The first one, Gary, can we back to the reserves and resources and can you talk a little bit about the 2.6 million ounces that got reclassified into resources from reserves and what caused those to move and what assets are they exactly?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. I can do that. Thanks, Tanya. I think, one of them \u2013 and when you look at our reserve-resource release, you can see there were price changes that affected the reserves by about 600,000 ounces, there was primarily a change in the capital price assumption at Phoenix that moved around 500,000 ounces from reserve to resource, so that's what we'd call our reclassification, so that added about 500,000 ounces of that 2.6 million ounces.","We had changes to Carlin due to updated pit designs. They'll show in revisions on the reserves side and that adds to the reclassified, the 2.6 million ounces. You see a very small number for revisions because that's a net number, and it nets out additions that we see for other reasons that Carlin and Ahafo North against some of the revisions to the Carlin pit design and also a Boddington, where we've updated the requirements to support the tailings facility expansion and moved about 600,000 ounces from reserve to resource. So, that gives you about \u2013 well, it's the majority of what that 2.6 million ounces and reclassification is for those three. The others were just technical updates, as we revised some requirements for drill spacing in different areas.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","I had 0.6 million ounces for Boddington and I had 0.5 million ounces for Carlin. I didn't have a number for Ahafo North. Was that in the 0.5 million ounces to 0.6 million ounces also?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Carlin was 0.7 million ounces, Boddington 0.6 million ounces and Phoenix 0.5 million ounces of that reclassification. Ahafo North was plus 0.5 million ounces.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","Okay.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","And there was another Carlin plus \u2013 I think it's about 0.6 million ounces...","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","Okay.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's offsetting in the reserve side.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, my second question is on Twin Creeks, the underground project. Can you just remind us of the \u2013 given that this one is going to be \u2013 you're making a decision on a second half of this year or mid-year, can you remind us the operational parameters, CapEx, cost, et cetera on this asset?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","What I'd say, this is like what we've done at Carlin, where we came to the end of an open pit and then do a decline basically down into the reserve next to or adjacent to and below the open pit. It's small in terms of its overall contribution. We'll update the market once we get that, but it's not big in terms of cost or in ounces. But it does add an increment at Twin Creeks.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","Any sort of sizes at under 50,000 ounces a year? Or, like, do we have any idea of size just to have it as a perspective?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure thing. Tom?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. It's 40,000 to 50,000 ounces at that sort of range...","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","And how \u2013 yeah, okay. And the capital would just be a decline to get to it. Would that be a safe thing to model?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, I think that sounds all right.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. And we've done the early study work there. We've actually installed the decline. And so, we've got access to the ore body in place. So, it actually would be a pretty short timeframe there, but it's small.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital","It's small? Okay. And then, maybe just the last question on Boddington, Twin Creeks again and I think you mentioned Carlin, too. I think it was said that the production will be declining over the next couple of years and then coming back up again. When you say coming back up again, are we coming back to what sort of level? Is it back to 2016 levels or...","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","We'll run through \u2013 start with Boddington. I'll have Tom go through.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes.

All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Meredith Bandy","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide two, I\u2019d like to refer you to our cautionary statement. We will be discussing a number of forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks. More information is included in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com. ","Now, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","","Thank you all for joining us this morning. I will start by introducing Meredith Bandy, our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Meredith joined us from BMO where she was an equity research analyst covering metals and mining. Many of you know Meredith from her past life. I am sure the rest of you will get to know and appreciate Meredith. I welcome this opportunity to highlight our strong second quarter results. ","We continued to exceed our cost and efficiency improvement targets while maintaining planned gold production. We also made strides in optimizing our portfolio and have generated nearly $800 million in non-core asset divestitures. ","Finally, we announced that we will develop the Merian mine in Suriname, the first in our optimized organic project pipeline to get the green light. Efficiency and safety go hand-in-hand and we also continued to improve our safety performance. ","Turning to slide four. We\u2019ve achieved seven straight quarters of keeping our total injury rates at or below 0.5 per 200,000 hours worked. And in the second quarter, we brought those rates down to an all-time low of 0.32. This represents industry leading performance, and more importantly, it represents 30,000 people taking accountability for working safely day-in and day-out.","While we are heading in the right direction, our performance was marred by the loss of George Ayama [ph] a contract security guard at Ahafo. We continue to keep George and his family in our thoughts as we renew our commitment to working safely and looking out for each other. This photo shows our team at the Yanecocha truck shop, who recently reached one year working without injury. One shift is coming up on four years working safely proving that zero harm is possible. Our focus on improving every aspect of our business continues to pay us. ","Turning to slide five. Our work to improve cost and efficiency helped us achieve a 17% per ounce reduction in gold all in sustaining costs and costs applicable to sales compared to the prior year quarter. Well some of that was related to fewer inventory write downs this year than last. 10% of our all in sustaining cost improvement was a direct result of operating more efficiently.","At the same time, we were able to increase gold production by 5%, compared to the second quarter of 2013. Based on this positive trajectory, we\u2019ve updated our 2014 outlook to reflect a 3% improvement in costs and a 2% improvement in production for the year. As we continue to optimize our project pipeline, we are pleased to announce that we\u2019re developing Merian in Suriname, a profitable new mine that offers lower cost production and establishes a foothold in a perspective new gold district. I will cover more on Merian in a few minutes. Building on our record of delivering projects Akyem and Phoenix Copper Leach on time and on budget, we are also progressing Turf Vent Shaft project in Nevada on time and on budget this year. ","We also completed the sale of Jundee for $94 million on July 1st which is up slightly from the previously announced 91 million due to working capital adjustments. This brings our total proceeds from the sale of non-core assets to nearly $800 million.","Finally, we made progress on improving our financial flexibility. During the second quarter we generated a $124 million in free cash flow and reduced capital expenditure by 58% over the prior year quarter.","Let\u2019s turn to more specifics on slide six. In the second quarter, we generated $359 million in cash savings on our gold all-in sustaining costs, bringing our year-to-date savings to $442 million. This puts us well ahead of schedule to achieve savings of approximately $600 million to $700 million by 2016.","Quarter-on-quarter, we reduced all-in sustaining costs from $1,283 to $1,063 per ounce, an increase attributable gold product from 1.17 million ounces to 1.22 million ounces. We also increased attributable copper production by 4% quarter-on-quarter primarily through the added production at our Phoenix Copper Leach operation.","I will take you through our regional performance now starting with production on slide seven.","In North America, production dipped slightly from the prior year quarter due to planned lower grades of Twin Creeks, the sale of Midas and permitting issues at La Herradura, which have since been resolved. Production in South America was lower over the prior year quarter due to a plant stripping campaign. We expect production to increase in the second half of 2014 as we reached higher grades at the Yanacocha. ","Our Australia New Zealand operations delivered a 12% increase in gold production quarter-on-quarter. This performance was led by our teams at Tanami and Waihi, who increased production by 53% and 64% respectively through a combination of higher grades and increased mining and throughput. ","In Africa, gold production rose more than 70% quarter-on-quarter with the addition of Akyem which is running well. Akyem produced 113,000 ounces of gold at $396 per ounce, the lowest cost in our portfolio. Costs are down across the business.","Turning to slide eight. We reduced our gold all-in sustaining cost by $220 per ounce compared to the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, this puts us below the low end of our 2014 guidance of $1,075 to $1,175 per ounce. These savings are sustainable and I will talk about the components starting with lower capital spending on slide nine.","We reduced capital spending by $356 million or approximately 58% compared to the second quarter of 2013, about 75% of this reduction reflects a lower development spending as we completed Akyem and Phoenix Copper Leach on time and on budget in 2013.","In Africa, we delivered Akyem $93 million below our budget. Our current development expenditure is focused on completed the Turf Vent Shaft where we spent approximately $22 million in the second quarter. Shaft sinking has advanced past the half way mark and we are on target to begin operation by late 2015.","Remaining capital reductions are largely the result of improved asset management which drove sustaining capital expenditure down by $78 million quarter-on-quarter. Capital is one part of the story. We have also improved productivity across the business.","I will now take you to slide 10. About half of our savings show up in the reduced costs applicable to sales. These savings represent successful leverage to improve efficiency across our operations with a focus on equipment utilization, mine planning and mill recovery.","For example, at Boddington, we\u2019ve achieved a 15% increase in shovel utilization and a 30% reduction in haul truck idle time in the mine. In the mill, we\u2019ve improved utilization rates by 13% year-to-date by improving conveyor reliability in consolidating maintenance shut downs. ","In Nevada, we improved our management controls and scheduled downtime to deliver a 10% improvement in Mill 6 utilization. Sustaining capital has also been reduced across the board. As I mentioned, improving asset management has played an important role. To give you another example, we reconfigured our Ahafo plant to balance mining rigs with milling capacity, reducing stripping and related equipment cost while achieving healthier returns.","We continue to optimize our exploration and project portfolio so that we are focused on our highest value opportunities. I will talk more about our project and exploration pipeline later in this call. ","To sum it up, our cost performance is about steadily and relentlessly improving every aspect of our portfolio from today\u2019s mines to tomorrow\u2019s growth prospects. Before I turn it over to Laurie I\u2019d like to address the current situation in Indonesia. Turning to slide 11, beside PTNNT\u2019s best efforts to resolve the export issue, a satisfactory outcome has yet to be achieved. Indonesia\u2019s new export restrictions and duties are in conflict with PTNNT\u2019s existing contract of work. The team was forced to halt operations on June 5th due to their inability to export copper concentrate. Realistically, we cannot continue to produce indefinitely without revenues. Logistically, there is simply no room left to store additional concentrate. We are pursuing two parallel paths to resolve this issue as quickly as possible; first, we are continuing our efforts to engage with the government which we hope will lead to a resolution outside of the arbitration. At the same time, we have filed for international arbitration to ensure PTNNT\u2019s rights and assets are protected for the benefit of its stakeholders. The request for arbitration means that we will seek interim injunctive relief to get our people back to work and resume exports. In the mean time PTNNT continues to ship copper concentrate produced to date to PT smelting their Graphic smelter in Indonesia. The outcome of arbitration is obviously difficult to predict but we estimate it could take at least several months to obtain a ruling an interim relief and at least several weeks to ramp back to full production if relief is granted. In the mean time, we\u2019ve adjusted our guidance. For illustrative purposes, a revised outlook reflects receipt of an export permit by January 1, 2015. ","I\u2019ll end by reiterating our support for the people of Indonesia deriving full value from their natural resources. Our local economic contribution included 9000 direct and indirect jobs. We have paid more than $3 billion in taxes and royalties to the government to date and we demonstrated our commitment to supplying PT Smelting and other companies that intend to build copper smelters in Indonesia. We\u2019ll keep you posted on our progress and I\u2019ll now hand it over to Laurie.","Laurie Brlas","","As Gary described our results indicate that our focus on lower cost resulted in a strong operating and financial performance for the quarter. With this focus we reduced cost, increased volume, delivered positive free cash flow and improved guidance. Turning to slide 13 and comparing this Q2 to the prior year quarter, as you can see we experienced a 7% drop in gold price and a 13% drop in revenue over the prior year quarter. ","While our production was up, we did experience a decline in sales volume primarily due to the export issues in Indonesia. Our GAAP net income from continuing operations was $182 million including a tax benefit due to a settlement with the IRS. Our full year tax rate guidance remains 37% to 40%. However, we expect to continue to see quarter to quarter swings in our tax rate, for example including the sale of Jundee our effective Q3 tax rate will be above our full year expectation. We reported adjusted net income of $101 million or $0.20 per share compared to a loss of $90 million in the prior year quarter or $0.18 per share. Cash provided from continuing operations was very strong at $378 million up 27% from the year ago quarter reflecting our commitment to reducing cost and improving efficiencies. We continue to be focused on generating free cash flow and we achieved $124 million in positive free cash flow from continuing operations for the quarter. ","Also during the quarter, we paid a previously announced dividend and as we announced this week our board approved a dividend of the same amount payable September 26. This dividend is based on our gold linked dividend policy and the average London PM fix during the first quarter which was $1288 per ounce. Turning to slide 14, we compare adjusted net income for the quarter to the prior year quarter. Lower sales volume and commodity prices compared with the prior year quarter were essentially offset by lower cabs this year as we focused on controlling what we could control. Improvements to cab are a direct result of the productivity inefficiency gains that Gary discussed previously. Stockpile revaluation had a significant negative impact on net income last year driven by the sharp drop in commodity prices in Q2 of 2013. With our continued cost savings efforts and reprioritization of projects, we saw a decrease in year-over-year advanced projects and exploration expense. As I previously discussed, we recognize the tax benefit this quarter, however this was a lower tax benefit than we recognized in Q2 of 2013. ","After considering all of that, we reported adjusted net income of a $101 million or $0.20 per share for the quarter. Turning to slide 15, we reported gold cabs for the quarter of $744 down 17% versus the prior year and at the lower end of our guidance for the year of $740 to $790. This continues to demonstrate focus and cost control as we also see in our improved 2014 guidance. The stockpile adjustments we experienced last year were a factor in the improved CAS, but we also saw significantly lower direct spend for all the reasons Gary mentioned. This lower direct spend was enough to more than offset the impact of the lower volume I mentioned earlier and the effective hedging due to the change in the Aussie dollar. ","Turning to slide 16 and our capital priorities, we continue to be guided by our capital allocation strategy. First, improving financial flexibility; second, enhancing our portfolio to focus on assets with the greatest risk reward profile, and third returning cash to our shareholders. ","We ended the quarter on a strong financial position with $1.7 billion in cash and non borrowings on our $3 billion revolver. We generated cash from continuing operations of $378 million which includes free cash flow of a $124 million. Since the quarter end, we completed the closure of a $575 million term loan and pay off of the convertible debt in July as planned.","Our portfolio was strengthened with the decision to invest in the Merian projects. We estimate that at current gold prices, Merian can be financed out of cash flow, available cash balances and asset sales including the recently closed divestiture of our Jundee operation. ","Over the last 12 months, we have generated nearly $800 million from divestitures and reported over a $100 million in free cash flow, which positions us well to move forward with the investment in Merian. We have also returned $89 million to our shareholders so far this year.","And now I will turn the call back over to Gary to discuss our improved 2014 outlook.","Gary Goldberg","Second quarter was another strong quarter and we are updating our 2014 outlook accordingly. Turning to slide 18; first, we\u2019ve reduced guidance for gold costs applicable to sales by 3% to between $720 and $760 per ounce. Four of our regions have reduced their gold all in sustaining cost outlook as well. ","Second, we have increased guidance for attributable gold production by 2% to between 4.7 million and 5 million ounces. This increase reflects higher production in Africa and Australia more than offsetting the impact of the Jundee divestiture and declaration of force majeure at Batu Hijau.","Our revised 2015 to 2016 guidance excludes Jundee and while we\u2019re yet to resolve export issues in Indonesia, we remain committed to doing so. As I mentioned earlier, for illustrated purposes, we\u2019ve presented guidance to reflect receipt of an export permit for Batu Hijau by January 1, 2015. Finally, we have updated our guidance to include Merian, with first production expected in late 2016. ","Turning to slide 19. I am pleased to announce that we are moving ahead with our project in Suriname. Our team has been on the ground for 10 years shaping Merian into a profitable operation and securing a position in the perspective Guiana Shield. During Merian\u2019s first five years of operation, we are forecasting average annual production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold, at all in sustaining cost of between $750 and $850 per ounce.","Total capital to bring Merian into commercial production is estimated at between $900 million and $1 billion on a 100% basis. The Government of Suriname has the right to acquire a 25% fully funded interest including all project capital, operating expense and an earnings contribution, which could reduce Newmont\u2019s share of project capital to $650 million.","Reserves at Merian are reported at 4.2 million ounces with a projected mine life of 11 years. As Laurie mentioned, we anticipate funding Merian through cash flow and available cash balances and we will begin construction as soon as the government grants us right of exploitation.","Merian is one of the several projects in our organic growth pipeline. Let\u2019s turn to slide 20 for an update on the others. Our team has spent considerable time over the past 18 months optimizing our project portfolio so that when the time is right, we can move forward with developing projects that generate good value.","This year, we are completing feasibility studies at Long Canyon in Nevada. We are taking a phased approach to developing this world class asset in the first phase is expected to deliver about 150,000 ounces of production for year at competitive cost. We anticipate reaching a decision to proceed in 2015.","We are also advancing two expansion projects in Ghana. First, the Ahafo mill expansion, which would increase throughput and help counter the impact of lower grade ore. This investment is expected to add about 200,000 ounces of production and we will reach a decision to proceed in 2015. ","Second, developing the Subika underground mine, which should improve ore grade and add another 200,000 ounces of production in Ghana. We will reach a decision to proceed with this project in May 2015 or early 2016. ","In New Zealand, we are in the final definition stages of our Correnso mine and expect to make funding decision in the near future. This is roughly $32 million development extends the life of Waihi. The exploration drive development was completed in May and drilling is nearly done. We are working closely with the community to ensure successful development of this new underground mine. ","Finally, in South America, we recently completed a review of our Conga project to assess alternative development options. At this point, there is no obviously smaller approach and we continue to review alternatives to reducing development capital especially with earth works.","All told, our short-term project pipeline represents more than 1 million ounces of production at competitive costs. We also have some exciting exploration prospects. A few examples of exceptionally high grade volumes in our own backyard include Exodus and Bull Moose, which are near our existing Carlin underground operations in Nevada and Federation which is adjacent to our Tanami operations.","These prospects are expected to add higher grade material to our inventory in 2014. It is still early days and we will keep you informed about our progress. Summing up our performance and prospects I will leave you with a view of where we are taking the business. ","Turning to slide 21. As we demonstrated in the second quarter, we continue to strengthen our ability to create value for our shareholders in three main areas. First, through continuous cost and efficiency improvements which we are achieving by operating more efficiently not just delaying our spend; second, through continuous portfolio improvement which we are delivering by optimizing our projects and divesting non-core assets; third, by maintaining a strong balance sheet. ","We are on track to maximize value in the short-term and to capture the benefits of economic recovery and demand growth in the longer-term. Our ultimate goal is to lead the gold sector and creating value for our shareholders. As always, I welcome your questions as we work towards that goal. ","Thank you for your time and now over to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Andrew Quail, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs ","","Just on Indonesia. If we don\u2019t see those export permits received by sort of 1 January \u201915. Do you see that will fit the construction decision or time line at Merian?","Gary Goldberg","At this stage and as we looked at our future cash flows and there are variety of gold price scenarios we are comfortable, we\u2019ve separated those two in terms of our financing concerns. We believe we can still cover it with our existing cash flow from our operations and as Laurie mentioned potentially some additional asset sales, but we really feel comfortable without having the two linked."," Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs ","And it really is a complex situation but there is dates that you guys could give anything on visible catalyst on sort of the international arbitration case. So is it just too early to speculate?","Gary Goldberg","No, I think the ranges I gave in terms of the filing is a process that goes through nominating the different arbitrators that will represent folks and we\u2019re going through that process now and as I mentioned several months before we get to a point of considering injunctive release. But more importantly, it\u2019s a dual track process and from our standpoint, we\u2019d rather reach an agreement with the government directly rather than go through the arbitration process but reach the point where we felt we needed to file that to get some certainty around the process.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs ","And one on the copper guidance, it goes up in \u201916. Is that a function of mine sequencing or is there something else going on there?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah, by delaying basically six months of production at Batu Hijau in the forecast that pushed some of the production that we would have received at the very end of \u201914 into \u201915 and also slipped some from \u201915 into \u201916, so it\u2019s \u201916 up. ","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs ","And last one just on CapEx in other South America. You guys are sort of guiding for about 225 to 270 and you are planning on about say two tenths of a million, obviously is the rest Conga or do you see sort of I\u2019d say delaying some of that Conga that you\u2019ve guided to in 2014 to further use that?","Gary Goldberg","","Yes, that\u2019s basically -- Merian is the majority of it and we\u2019ve got Conga with our water first approach going there.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question from John Bridges, JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","John Bridges - JPMorgan","","Sorry to be repetitive, but just wondering with Batu Hijau is there any case law around reopening the mine in arbitration process, you know. Do you have sort, how much confidence do you have in that scenario.","Gary Goldberg","","I think, from our standpoint in terms of case law, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a lot of examples that would mimic our exact case that\u2019s going on but that\u2019s why we want to continue down both arbitration path but more importantly to continue with dialogue with the government to try to reach a resolution. A lot has happened here in the last week or two in Indonesia and currently this week there\u2019s religious holidays going on so we\u2019ll see how the dialogue goes starting again next week.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","","Okay, in your logic (ph) about Merian you talk about a new innovative development plan there, what have you changed, the capital under there is relatively low.","Gary Goldberg","","Basically what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve slightly increased the size of the mill but more importantly over the last couple of years because we\u2019ve had time to do additional in field drilling we\u2019ve confirmed the amount of saprolite that\u2019s there, which allows us to be able to give the higher and increased production rates.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","","Is there a plan to increase the scale of the mill when you get into the hard rock to maintain throughput?","Gary Goldberg","","At this point we\u2019d be looking to add some additional crushing capacity once we get into that further down. I think the other piece getting back to what we\u2019re looking at with Merian as we\u2019re looking at outperforming, we\u2019ll be working with G Mining and people who\u2019ve had expertise in developing projects in Suriname rather than bringing in a large EPCM contractor to do the work.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","","That place will be tricky, right.","Gary Goldberg","","Yes.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","","New Zealand, just finally, is bit surprising because there\u2019s been a talk about that asset being up for sale, any thoughts about the longer term strategy with that.","Gary Goldberg","","I think it continues a good performing asset, we see good expansion possibilities with the life as I mentioned with Corenzo and we\u2019ll continue to work down the path of developing all our assets to their fullest capability but always be open to consideration if others should come along and value the asset more than we do.","Operator","","Thank you, next question David Haughton, BMO, your line is open. ","David Haughton - BMO ","","Yes, good morning Gary, so I thank you for reintroducing that pipeline, it gives us a good idea as to where your projects are situated and the first one off the block is Merian. You\u2019ve mentioned that there\u2019s potential for the government to participate 25% in this project, what\u2019s the timing and the kind of payments that they\u2019d have to come up with to be able to do that.","Gary Goldberg","","Thanks David. The timeframe they have basically once the right of exploitation has been issued, they\u2019ve got a 105 days in which to fund their up to 25% investment. The amount that they would fund is based on a multiple of historic cost and actually they go through a process of auditing what\u2019s been spent to come up with what the historic costs are and then we\u2019d fund that amount and then we\u2019d just carry if they didn\u2019t exercise the 25% they would pay for basically their 25% share going forward and we\u2019d cover our 75%.","David Haughton - BMO ","","Okay, and the [Indiscernible] for the government that you can read, they\u2019re open to that kind of investment?","Gary Goldberg","","Yes, and the discussions we\u2019ve had and we need to let them do their process and speak for themselves but they appear very interested in pursuing their 25% interest.","David Haughton - BMO ","","Okay and what\u2019s the fiscal rating that you\u2019ve got there with the royalty in tax. ","Gary Goldberg","","Give me just a second here; I\u2019ve got to remember the royalty rates. ","David Haughton - BMO ","","At one stage I think it had been set at 5%.","Gary Goldberg","","I believe 6% is the royalty that we\u2019ve agreed in our mineral agreement.","David Haughton - BMO ","","All right, and the income tax?","Gary Goldberg","","It is 36. I need a table of all the ones from around the world because; I sure don\u2019t want to make them all consistent but.","David Haughton - BMO ","","All right and Laurie made the point that you\u2019ve got the internal capacity to fund that, but what do you think about project finance at all for this endeavor.","Gary Goldberg","","We could at some point but at this stage we don\u2019t see the need to do that, but at this stage we\u2019re not considering it.","Laurie Brlas","[Indiscernible]","David Haughton - BMO ","","Yes, fair enough. Okay and yes I did hear that, it sounded like you\u2019re at the bottom of the well but I did hear that, thank you Laurie. And just finally just looking at Africa, it\u2019s outperformed expectations and I guess the sense that one gets from that is, is it sustainable and what are the key drivers for you in making it sustainable at that, the outperformance would seem.","Gary Goldberg","","I think in Africa we\u2019ve done a couple of things, clearly building a team on getting things settled and moving that forward has been critical. I think the team\u2019s done a really good job and we see good production as continuing well there. With Ahafo it needed a bit of a step back, much like we did at Tanami as we stripped out some of these projects, the mill expansion and the underground it helped to expose some opportunities to improve basically the overall plan and make sure that we matched mining rates to milling rates. By doing that that\u2019s reduced our stripping requirements here over the next year or two and helped basically to improve the overall results there. And then we can look at those expansion projects in a more measured way and bring them on in stages rather than try to bring them on all at the same time. ","At the same time, we are doing work at a Ahafo North to continue to better understand that resource and how it may fit in and what the timing maybe. And we\u2019ve looked alternatives, whether it\u2019s a standalone mill or we try to transport or down to the existing Ahafo complex. Right now probably looking better towards a standalone mill but that\u2019s still out there in the sea where that sits on the pipeline.","Operator","Thank you. Next question, Patrick Chidley, HSBC. Your line is open.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Just a question on Merian, back to Merian. With respect to power I understand that you are planning to use basically truck HFO into the site and generate your own power. Given that there is quite a little hydro power in Suriname, is there a chance so that government might come to the party and with some low cost hydro to actually help you develop maybe even a bigger mine in future which would be beneficial for the country similar maybe to what Quebec does with its mines for example providing low cost power and could that be linked to the government buying for example?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, Patrick thanks for the question. At this stage because of where we are located, we are not on the grid. So it would take putting reticulation and connect this up to the grid to be able to that. That said with the gen sets we are putting in and we are doing it in a staged basis because we don\u2019t need as many to begin with. We\u2019re expecting our power cost at current diesel prices and oil prices to run around $0.15 to $0.17 per kilowatt hour. So I wouldn\u2019t rule that out, but at this stage it would depend on finding more ore and being able to extend our resources there to look at those sorts of alternatives. So it\u2019s not part of our current discussions with the government.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Right, right. Just maybe the government could help on the power side, if they have trouble financing that 25% for example. And in terms of the first five years that you forecast, is that all in saprolite or when do you switch the fresh ore and when you do switch the fresh ore, is there a change in the grade profile?","Gary Goldberg","It\u2019s all in saprolite. The grade would drop just a little bit at that stage, but it actual stays fairly consistent over the mine life and we start to get into the fresh ore, the non-saprolite ore more in year six and seven in the plan. ","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","And then six and seven does the great change at all or does it stay the same sort of average reserve grade?","Gary Goldberg","It just gets harder. It\u2019s not much of a change in grade."," ","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Okay, thanks. And just Yanacocha, based on your corporate [indiscernible] pilot program when you still receive. ","Gary Goldberg"," ","I was down there a couple of weeks ago and had a chance to take a look at the pilot plant and see how it\u2019s working. So they continue to work through as you\u2019d expect just when you are working small heaps like this, then some of that some offset that you get along the way but they are producing a good quality copper cathode, we are getting the recoveries in sort of the time frames in fact a even a little bit better in some cases and testing what\u2019s the right size. We did this at run a mine ore and different sizes of crushing to see what gets the best recovery over time and see how that then fits into our larger plan to develop that ore body, but that still remains one of several ways of developing the copper gold portions of the Yanacocha ore body as we look also at different milling and options to handle the NRJ.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Thanks. And final question just on guide, you mentioned two options to increase production by 200,000 ounces each. Can you say whether that\u2019s you thinking about that as replacement ounces and so you have steady production or is that going to be a net increase in production in 2017 onwards.","Gary Goldberg","Yes, I think it\u2019s a combination. So I wouldn\u2019t just add for 400 on top out there. But it wouldn\u2019t completely replacement; some of it will be in expansion especially I think the underground as we would go into that because of the higher grade that we get. ","Operator","","Thank you. Next question from Greg Barnes, TD Securities. Your line is open.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities","Just returning to Merian again, what kind of internal rate of return do you estimate on the project at current spot gold price around 1,300?","Greg Goldberg","Current price as we see it in the high teen\u2019s rate of return.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities","Is that a livid (ph) IRR or just a straight project IRR?","Greg Goldberg","It\u2019s just a straight project IRR.","Greg Barnes - TD Securities","Okay. And what about more technical details regarding the stripping ratios and cost per ton mining milling those kind of details, are they available? ","Greg Goldberg","We can get back on that through Meredith. I don\u2019t have those in front of me right now.","","Greg Barnes - TD Securities","Okay, I will contract Meredith. Thanks.","Greg Goldberg","Okay. Anything else Greg?","Greg Barnes - TD Securities","No that\u2019s it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question, Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Just really a technical question first on slide 15, you highlighted a large drop in your cost applicable to sales of 17%, the largest driver is stockpile revaluation. Could you just walk us through how that is a cash flow impact, perhaps Laurie?","Laurie Brlas","","Yes, that is really not going to be a cash flow item because that was primarily the revaluations last year that happened when the gold price dropped so we revalued the stockpiles that we have been carrying on the balance sheet so that would primarily be not a cash flow item. ","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","","Okay, and then just some comments that were made earlier, I think by you Laurie about the 100 million of free cash flow. Over what period was that?","Laurie Brlas","","The last trailing four quarters.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","","Then you implied that you had paid about 89 million of dividends, so the 100 million of free cash flow, I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s pre dividend. ","Laurie Brlas","","Correct.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","","So rough number is what you earned in cash flow you paid out as dividend and then you also did about 800 million of asset sales. So, what I\u2019m trying to understand on a go forward basis is how much do you view, you said that you internally cover Merian with internal cash flow, but you also mentioned the possibility of further asset sales so are you kind of earmarking any part of that of your 650 million CapEx to be covered by asset sales on a go forward basis.","Laurie Brlas","","No. Nothing specific like that Jorge and just a reminder that that 650 is going to be over the next three years so that expenditure covers a significant period of time here so it\u2019s not all coming in 2014 or even \u201915.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","","Okay, and then in your 2016 guidance, where Merian first starts up, could you comment, are you assuming a 100% ownership at that point or are you assuming 75% and then the government comes after their 20%.","Laurie Brlas","","No, we\u2019re assuming 100%. We would not assume that they\u2019re coming in, all of our numbers were, they\u2019re 100% at this point in time, the capital expenditure and the production when it comes online.","Gary Goldberg","","We\u2019ll go ahead and change the guidance should the government decide to exercise its right and modify that going forward. It\u2019s relatively small in 2016, you won\u2019t see a big number change but we would get those numbers plus the change to capital expected.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","","Right, and how does the timing or the contract work for the government, do they have an open time table any time up until the mine is built or even after it\u2019s built, to exercise that 25% option or is it kind of a use it or lose it thing under a certain calendar.","Gary Goldberg","","Basically, a use it or lose it approach I guess is one way of looking at it, they\u2019ve got a 105 days from the issuance of the right of exploitation which now that the board had approved and we\u2019ve announced that we\u2019re ready to move forward, that happens first and then they\u2019ve got a 105 days.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","","Thanks, and what\u2019s the timeframe for when you believe they\u2019re going to issue this right of exploitation.","Gary Goldberg","","We believe they have all the information they need in which to be able to issue that at this stage but need to now work closely and check in what their sort of timeframe is. I don\u2019t expect it to be long, but it\u2019s one we\u2019ve got to work through with the government.","Operator","","Thank you, our final question comes from Brian Yu, Citi, your line is open.","Brian Yu - Citi ","","Thanks, good morning. My first question is, I guess there\u2019s looks more at longer term CapEx versus balance sheet and it wasn\u2019t that long ago where people asking you what you\u2019re doing in equity issuance delevering. I think we\u2019re coming out is this a CapEx spend, you\u2019re starting to take on more projects. How should we think about, as you make decisions on others like Ahafo, Subika and others? Is the target to maintain the current debt level, net debt level, what\u2019s going to dictate your ability to spend on these new projects?","Gary Goldberg","","At this stage the net advantage we have is these aren\u2019t all coming in at the same time and they\u2019re not real large projects in terms of capital, in fact Merian, the largest of the ones we\u2019ve talked about other than Congo which obviously is a bit bigger than those, so we\u2019re going to assess each at the time. Our focus is still going to be looking to deliver these projects from within our own cash flow and operating cash flow from the business, but we can assess at the time, but there\u2019s no intention to either issue more debt or to issue equity to do these, we\u2019re looking to do it from our existing asset business.","Brian Yu - Citi ","","Okay, great and then second one, let\u2019s circle back to Indonesia, I know when you guys had gone into arbitration of the Free Port actually struck their MOU, looks like they\u2019re ramping up, number one there\u2019s this change thing over the near term and into your fiscal, continue to proceed with arbitration. Are you guys hoping for a better deal structure than what Free Port was able to get.","Gary Goldberg","","Yes, I think you know the structure that they had and the things they\u2019ve got different issues they were addressing in their changes to their contract at work. We\u2019re having similar discussions with the government around making changes to the contract at work aligned with what both our mine characteristics are and the differences in our contract at work. That said we\u2019re confident in our arbitration case otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have filed it, but we\u2019re really interested in finding a negotiated solution with the government and want to continue down this parallel path to resolve it as soon as possible.","","Gary Goldberg","","Thanks Brian, and we have a couple more questions I\u2019m told.","Operator","","Thank you, next question from Adam Graf, Cowen, your line is open.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Just a quick question on Long Canyon, I know it\u2019s still preliminary but could you give us the timing of when you guys would breaking ground and then starting first production on phase I for Long Canyon? And then perhaps then talk about how you envision transitioning to phase II?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, at this stage Adam we are still going through finalizing the engineering studies and working to get the permit this year. We bring that one forward early next year for consideration. If we are to make the decision to move forward, we are looking at capital expenditure in the $250 million to $300 million range for that production level and that\u2019s about a five to six year mine life that would have. So it\u2019s during that phase of production that we\u2019d be looking develop phase II and be in a position to have that take on either at the end or slightly before the end of that sort of five to six year mine life. So that\u2019s all still a bit rough and we will get more details as we get through some of those studies and get more certainty around permitting. Operator I think we have one more.","Operator","And our next question, Farooq Hamed, Barclays. Your line is open.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","","I just had a couple of follow up questions really on some of the guidance that you guys put out and maybe just some housekeeping around that. For \u201915 and \u201916 you are assuming that you have Batu Hijau export permits back again, what is the production that you are expecting from Batu Hijau for \u201915 and \u201916?","Gary Goldberg","Well basically what you see in the copper, I am just taking a look at the production numbers and I don\u2019t have the exact numbers in front of me.","Laurie Brlas","[Indiscernible]. There is no change to those estimates; we\u2019re just pushing out by six months for the [indiscernible].","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","Okay, sorry I missed the front part of what you were saying. So you are saying there is no change from what you put out previously.","Laurie Brlas","","The July 1st 8-K which we filed in conjunction with the announcement of the arbitration breaks out the Batu Hijau production and that\u2019s not changed, it\u2019s just pushed back and we can go over that offline if you would like.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","Sure, okay that\u2019s no problem. Maybe I\u2019ll just follow up in the offline. And then just with regards to 2014 guidance, I know on the call, you said that you are expecting better production from Yanacocha in the second half, I missed the comment about North America. On an overall basis, are you expecting better production in the second half of the year versus the first half?","Gary Goldberg","In North America slightly better, we had but not a very big change because we continue Mexico will help if not having Mexico in the first versus the second half will probably the biggest part driving that through.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","So you are actually from the America side, you are looking at production both in North and South America in H2.","Laurie Brlas","Yes, yes.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","Okay, no that\u2019s fair. I just wanted to update my numbers and actually had you guys coming down a little bit in the second half. So that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you, everyone for joining us. It\u2019s a very pleasing to talk about the results for the second quarter, strong results out in the operations as we continue to deliver our commitments to the market and to our employees and the rest of our stockholders. Very pleased to see Merian is moving forward, one of several projects in organic growth pipeline and I appreciate everyone joining here this morning. Have a good day, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you for joining.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jessica Largent","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's full year and fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Tom Palmer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Atkinson, Chief Operating Officer; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team. Turning to Slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Tom on Slide 3.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Jess. Good morning and thank you all for joining our call. Newmont has a track record of superior operating and financial performance and we are continuing to build on this proven record like seeding the commitments we made early last year. As we enter our centenary year, I'm excited about the opportunities we have in front of us to safely deliver superior value for all of our stakeholders.","Turning to Slide 4 for a recap of our major achievements. In 2019, we continue to lead in environmental, social and governance stewardship by achieving our public targets and being recognized as the gold industry leader for our performance. Last year, we completed two historic transactions, creating the most balanced portfolio of long-life assets with the ability to generate robust free cash flow for decades to come. We produced 6.9 million gold equivalent ounces, including 6.3 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $966 an ounce in line with our full year guidance.","We generated $3.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA and realized significant value from the Goldcorp acquisition exceeding our targets. We also reported the largest reserves in company history with an industry leading 100 million ounces of gold reserves. We drove improvement across our portfolio and have now delivered $2.7 billion in value through our full potential program since 2013. We also delivered four projects on four continents on time and within budget and approved full funds for our next expansion at Tanami. We reached agreement to divest Red Lake, KCGM and our holdings in Continental to generate more than $1.4 billion in cash proceeds and we returned an unprecedented $1.4 billion to shareholders last year with $900 million in dividends and $500 million in share buybacks. This is unmatched in the gold industry. Our 2019 performance is evidence that we continue to deliver on our commitments.","Turning to Slide 5. We are making excellent progress and exceeding our commitments the value delivery from our five new operations. At the start of last year, we made a commitment to deliver $365 million of run rate improvements per annum by the end of 2021. I'm very pleased that we are on track to exceed that commitment by nearly 40%, realizing more than $500 million of cash flow improvements in 2021 through accelerating G&A and exploration synergies along with higher than planned full potential improvements at Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro. This year alone, we expect to achieve $340 million in cash flow improvements representing over 90% of the commitment we made for value delivery from this transaction. Each of our accomplishments was grounded in the safety of our people and the sustainability of our operations.","Turning to Slide 6, improving safety remains our relentless focus for all of us here at Newmont, ensuring that everyone working in our business can return home safely to their family and friends is paramount. Through our visible caring leadership and the integrated systems we put into place to manage risk consistently across our global operations, we are working to significantly and sustainably improve our safety performance. My expectation is that everyone who works in our business understands first and foremost the fatality risks associated with their work and are ensuring that the critical controls that are required to manage them are in place at all times.","A robust safety culture is one that is constantly reinforcing systems, behaviors and actively sharing lessons learned from serious incidents. This is fundamental to the wellbeing of our people and underpins our operating performance. Now sustainability performance is also about consistent application of sound governance practices across our global business coupled with the quality of our engagement and the relationships with key stakeholders. As a measure of our industry leading performance, we were honored to be recognized as the top gold mining company by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth year in a row.","Turning to look at our global portfolio on Slide 7. Our world-class assets are located in the most balanced and favorable jurisdictions. We have the industry's largest gold reserves at 100 million ounces with nearly 90% located in the Americas and Australia. This offers Newmont shareholders exposure to 124 gold reserve ounces per 1,000 shares. Our reserve base also provides significant exposure to copper, silver, zinc and lead representing an additional 63 million gold equivalent ounces. Across our 12 operated mines and two non-operated joint ventures, we have an average reserve life greater than 10 years with mine lives at our largest assets, Boddington, Tanami, Pe\u00f1asquito, and Ahafo extending well into the 2030s underpinning the strongest and most sustainable portfolio in the industry.","Turning to Slide 8. We will produce a steady 6.2 million to 6.7 million ounces of gold per year through 2024. In addition, we will generate $1.5 billion in revenue each year from producing between 1.2 million to 1.4 million gold equivalent ounces with silver, zinc and lead from Pe\u00f1asquito and copper from Boddington. Combined we deliver nearly 8 million gold equivalent ounces per year, the most of any company in our industry. Turning to Slide 9. Even during a year involving the closing of two historic transactions, our full potential program remained as strong as ever delivering $430 million of value in 2019. Looking forward, all-in sustaining costs are expected to improve from $975 an ounce in 2020 to $850 an ounce in 2023 through the delivery of our full potential program and ongoing investment in profitable projects. Over this time, we will maintain our capital discipline through investing approximately $1 billion of sustaining capital per year to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development.","With that I will turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Rob Atkinson, on Slide 10 to review our operational performance.","Rob Atkinson","Thanks, Tom, and I'll start with an update on Australia's performance on Slide 11. In 2019, Australia produced more than 1.4 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $908 per ounce. At Tanami, we delivered a record year for production and costs with 500,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of less than $725 per ounce. Through our full potential program, we delivered significant value from improvements at the pace plant and with greater pace fill reliability, the site can continue to sustainably increase mine productivity. Successful delivery of the first Tanami expansion project in 2017 and the Tanami power project in early 2019 have enabled this performance and established a foundation for us to continue expanding this terrific asset.","Our next phase of investment in Tanami expansion 2 has a potential to extend the life beyond 2040. We'll reduce operating costs by over 10% and will provide a platform for us to further explore a prolific mineral endowment in the Tanami district. At Boddington, we produced approximately 850,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2019 as full potential programs in mining and processing led to improvements in truck and shovel productivity as well as increased gold recovery. Our planned stripping campaign in the South Pit is progressing very well. In fact, full potential improvements to truck and shovel productivities have accelerated the time when we will reach higher grades to earlier in 2021.","And at KCGM, we completed the sale of our 50% ownership in early January. We are supporting Northern Star and Saracen by providing transitional services through the second quarter. The Australia region has consistently exceeded conversion targets by more than offsetting depletion. During 2019, Tanami added 1.5 million ounces of gold reserves, and over the last seven years, reserves have grown by more than 250% and resources have also increased by nearly 200%. Lastly, Boddington's Autonomous Haulage system was approved by our board of directors earlier this week, and this world-class asset is positioned to realize improved productivity and significant value over a 14 year reserve life.","Turning to a bit more detail in Boddington's Autonomous Haulage system on Slide 12. Over the last several years, Boddington has delivered a step change improvement in operational performance, which has increased mine and mill productivities, added 4.2 million ounces of gold reserves and extended mine life well into the 2030s. These successes have now positioned the operation to make its next step change improvement, the full automation of its haulage fleet. Boddington will invest $150 million to purchase 29 new CAT 793 haul trucks. It will retrofit seven existing trucks at the site and install the Caterpillar command autonomous haulage system. This investment will enhance safety by removing people from the line of fire and reduce the potential for vehicle to vehicle interactions.","These systems will also improve productivity and create a more controlled, predictable and efficient haulage operation and ultimately lowering Boddington's mining cost per ton generating an internal rate of return of more than 35%. With the improved costs, mine life is extended by at least two years from additional laybacks in the North Pit. The support we will receive from CAT will be essential to the success of this work and we have a very strong working relationship with them, which has been formed over many years. And we're also uniquely positioned to support effective implementation and operation of the fleet. Thanks to the technical capabilities and previous experience of leaders throughout our business. The adoption of autonomous haulage has true replication potential and will inform our approach to implementing these systems at other Newmont operations and projects.","Now to our Africa operations on Slide 13. 2019 was a record year for the Africa region with 1.1 million ounces of attributable gold production at all-in sustaining costs of less than $800 per ounce on the back of successfully completing Ahafo\u2019s expansion projects. We declared commercial production at the Ahafo mill expansion, which will maximize value from higher grade underground ore efficiently process ore from existing open pits and stockpiles allowing us to deliver stable production well beyond 2030. ","Our team delivered yet another solid quarter and offset lower grade as the site team worked closely with the process control team at our operations support hub in Perth to drive sustainable Sag mill throughput improvements. ","This is just one example of how Newmont is leveraging its global capability to consistently drive improved performance and productivity right across our portfolio of operations and projects.","Looking forward as previously highlighted in our guidance, the region will step down to 850,000 ounces in 2020 as Ahafo progresses it's stripping campaign for Phase 4 at Subika open pit and advances underground development for the updated mining method at Subika Underground. With the transition to a more productive underground mining method, Ahafo has increased its reserve and resource base collectively adding 1 million ounces in 2019.","Now to discuss our North America operations on Slide 14, North America produced more than 1 million ounces of gold in 2019 with a strong fourth quarter as expected. At Porcupine we successfully ramped up the Borden underground mine providing additional higher grade ore.","At CC&V we recovered ounces from the VLF1 leach pad that had been deferred from prior quarters. And at \u00c9l\u00e9onore we delivered a strong fourth quarter with higher grades at Horizon 5 but expect to softer Q1 as a result of mine sequence changes.","\u00c9l\u00e9onore is a complex ore body when taking into account stope sequencing, backfill requirements and grade presentation. Our technical services and exploration teams are strongly supporting the operation to integrate our geology and geotechnical models to optimize a life of mine plan that will safely and sustainably mine our reserves and extend the life of this ore body.","At Musselwhite rehabilitation work is nearing completion and our contractor segmentation is progressing well with the construction and installation of the conveyor. We are on track to have the conveying system fully commissioned and the mine back at full production by the start of October at the latest.","Over the last six months we've been mining ore and building a stockpile ready to feed the mill. This stockpile currently contains approximately 50,000 ounces of gold. Commissioning of the mill is progressing very well and in fact we just processed first ore from our stockpiles through the mill this week.","At Pe\u00f1asquito, our work to sustainably improve the cost base offers the potential to build upon an already exceptional reserve and resource base similar to what we have achieved at Boddington.","In 2019, we declared gold equivalent reserves of more than 24 million ounces underpinning a current reserve life of 12 years. And operationally we delivered a strong finish to the year which we expect to continue into 2020 as we reach higher grades in the main Pe\u00f1asco pit.","Turning to Slide 15 for more detail, in 2019 we delivered more than $50 million in cash flow improvements from quick win initiatives at Pe\u00f1asquito exceeding our market commitment for full potential delivery at that operation.","When we launched full potential at site, our team quickly identified that the crushing circuit at the front end of the mill, what we call the augmented feed circuit, was the key bottleneck in the processing plant. And that working this bottleneck to sustainably increase throughput and improve the quality of crust ore provided to the Sag mills would lift the overall performance of the processing plant.","Early quick wins in the augmented feed circuit, came at the secondary crusher and high pressure grinding rollers where we replicated our success at Boddington and did a direct lift and shift of control logic to immediately improve the quality and quantity of feed.","Taken together these initiatives delivered record crushing throughput and record metal production for silver, zinc and lead in November. In 2020, we will continue to work this bottleneck hard and for those coming to Pe\u00f1asquito next week, I'm very much looking forward to taking you through more detail on this and other important work we are doing to deliver more than $100 million of further costs and productivity improvements at Pe\u00f1asquito by 2021.","Rounding out the regions with South America, on Slide 16, South America produced nearly 1.3 million ounces of gold and delivered all-in sustaining costs of approximately $815 per ounce in 2019.","At Merian, we delivered better than expected fourth quarter performance and I've transitioned into mining harder ore at the Merian 2 pit. Fresh rock will present higher grade and improve mine productivity which helps offset reduced mill throughput rates.","Yanacocha continues stripping the Quecher Main pit as we move out of higher grade ore in the Tapado Oeste pit and we are now placing Quecher Main ore on the new Carachugo leach pad and we expect to see recovery of these ounces during 2020.","At Cerro Negro, we mined higher grades as expected from Eureka and Mariana Norte and work to develop out to Emilia is progressing well as production begins to ramp-up from this new mining area later in 2020.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on Slide 17.","Nancy Buese","Thanks, Rob. Turning to Slide 18, for the financial highlights. I'm pleased to report strong fourth quarter and 2019 results. During the fourth quarter, Newmont delivered revenue of nearly $3 billion, an increase of 45% over the prior year quarter with the additional sales from our new operations and higher gold prices.","Adjusted net income of $410 million or $0.50 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.3 billion, an increase of 70% from the prior year quarter. Cash from continuing operations was $1.2 billion driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow of over $775 million, an increase of more than $300 million from the prior year quarter.","With a solid finish to the year, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.7 billion and free cash flow of more than $1.4 billion or $1.92 per share of which we paid an annual dividend of $0.56 per share. We also paid out an additional $470 million in 2019 in the form of a special dividend.","Finally, in association with the $1 billion share buyback we announced in December, 2019 we have already repurchased $500 million worth of shares.","Turning to Slide 19, for a review of earnings per share in more detail, fourth quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $537 million or $0.66 per share. Adjustments included $0.11 related to the change in fair value of investments, $0.10 related to tax adjustments and valuation allowance and $0.05 of other charges. Taking these adjustments into account, we\u2019ve reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $0.50 cents per diluted share.","Turning to Slide 20. At Newmont, we build our annual business plan based on conservative assumptions including a $1,200 gold price and a disciplined approach through which mine plans are developed based on reserves and the best demonstrated performance of plants and equipment.","Our base plan at $1,200 gold price allows us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet with a focus on our maturity profile to maintain our infrastructure and invest in mine development through a steady $1 billion of sustaining capital.","We continue investing in organic growth, including approximately $600 million to $700 million of development, capital expenditures and another $250 million of exploration and $150 million of advanced project investment per annum and return cash to shareholders through an industry leading annual dividend.","In January, we announced a plan to increase our annual dividend by 79% to $1 per share reflecting the confidence we have in our business to deliver substantial cash flows well into the future. The increased dividend will be effective upon approval and declaration of our first quarter 2020 dividend in April.","Turning to Slide 21. We expect to generate significant free cash flow through this cycle. At current gold prices, our portfolio will generate more than $10 billion of free cash flow over the next five years and even using our more conservative $1,200 gold price space free cash flow would still total $5 billion over that same period.","As shown on this slide, for every $100 per ounce increase in gold prices above our base assumption, we'll deliver approximately $400 million of incremental attributable free cash flow per year. Excess free cash will be used towards debt reduction and further shareholder returns.","Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue a trajectory of industry leading financial performance by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long-term value creation.","And now I'll hand it over to Tom to wrap up on Slide 22.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Nancy. Turning to Slide 23, we continue to build momentum and are taking the necessary steps to position our business for long-term success. We remain focused on the five foundational principles of our strategy. Keeping our people safe with a relentless commitment to our safety culture and systems; growing margins through the application of our operating, technical and exploration discipline; leveraging our exploration program and unmatched portfolio to grow reserves and resources; optimizing our world-class project pipeline and maintaining discipline around capital allocation.","Thank you for your time. And with that I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matthew Murphy of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Matthew Murphy","Hi. I had some questions on some of the former Gold Corp asset reserves. I mean if we start with \u00c9l\u00e9onore, you're getting down there in reserve life now and I'm just wondering what your confidence is to extend that back out. And what are the key factors? Is it exploration or is it more about getting costs down so you can bring in more economic ounces?","Tom Palmer","Yes. I'll start off Matt and I've got my Chief Technology Officer, Dean Gehring with me here, he might have a few comments as well. But the story for me at \u00c9l\u00e9onore is a parallel to the story you'll have seen us follow at Leeville. We have got a complex ore body where you need to make sure that geology model and your geotechnical model are well aligned and integrated to form your life of mine plan.","And then you take in consideration stope sequencing and backfill and the like. That is a key focus for us at that operation. So we have applied our Newmont discipline to how we determine reserves and resources. We actually have the same people that worked through the very good work we did at Leeville several years ago, Kate Williams and Dave Thornton, the very same people are working on the ground with the team at \u00c9l\u00e9onore to build those integrated plans.","And if you look at Leeville today and look at the life that it has in front of it, it's a great deal of credit can be put in the hands of Dave and Kate for that work. So, we're getting those basic models and plans in place and then combining that with an exploration program combined with full potential, bringing costs down that look to extend the life with reserves and resources that meet the Newmont standard. Dean is there anything you wanted to add to that?","Dean Gehring","Yes, thanks Tom. Matthew, one of the things, a couple of things I'd like to add to that. One is, as you probably know at Newmont, we provide and apply very high standards to how we determine our reserves and resources. And let me provide a little bit of background also get and lead up to some specifics around your question around \u00c9l\u00e9onore.","So our standard for our study requirements and our drill spacing far exceeds any regulatory agencies and current codes like JORC, SEC or 43-101. And I would also say we don't apologize for having those high standards because it has resulted in us that disciplined approach, it results in us being very consistent delivering against our plan.","But to illustrate the point of how that plays through in our reserves and resource calculations we can look at a mine like Cerro Negro as a starting point. And so as we applied our standards to that site, we ended up reclassifying about 1.5 million ounces, but it went from reserves to resources. And because of it's still a highly prospective area we're confident that those resources are going to come right back into reserves just as we do a little bit more work.","And just quickly to illustrate the point further, if we look at Pe\u00f1asquito, we see that the reserves there maintained what they were before, but through our work we actually added an additional three million ounces on the resource side. But switching to \u00c9l\u00e9onore specifically your question, if we go back to what Rob mentioned earlier, \u00c9l\u00e9onore is a complex ore body. And when we apply our demonstrated performance to the mining wits and dilutions, we ended up revising about a million ounces out of there.","And the rest of the revisions really came from geologic model updates similar to what Tom mentioned earlier. So the net of all those revisions resulted in resources remaining about the same at a million ounces. But those resources that we have there are at a much higher level of confidence than they were before.","But I think what's important to recognize out of all this is that we know how to mine deposits like \u00c9l\u00e9onore. To Tom's point we have a strong technical team. It allows us to deploy the resources where they're needed and it allows us to take full advantage of our full potential program and also to rapidly replicate our best practices. So, we're, I'm fully confident that we're going to continue to extend the mine life there and that we're not looking at a short mine life.","Matthew Murphy","Okay. Thank you very much. And you touched on Cerro Negro, so I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry","Tom, Nancy and Rob, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just around the autonomous opportunity that you've mentioned at Boddington. Just wondering if you can give a bit more color on the actual savings on a per ton of mining. And also just as a follow up, will you likely wait until seeing how that goes at Boddington or are you looking at other sites between now and 2021 in advance of that. Thanks.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Chris. I\u2019ll take the second part of your question and Rob, just pulling out, he can give you the answer to the second part, if not, we can go offline and get those numbers to you. Very important part of Autonomous Haulage is to vet it down and prove the operation of that technology in our gold mining environment and to manage through the change management process associated with that.","So very important part of Boddington achieving the level of performance that it has and through that level of performance extending its mine life to underpin the replacement of a mining fleet with an autonomous mining fleet is an excellent opportunity for us to bring autonomous into our business.","We'd be looking first foremost at using that technology to prove up the base case for some of the key projects that we have in our project pipeline. So, it'd be the very large gold copper deposits that we've got a pre-feasibility study. So proving, proving up Boddington and having that inform those pre-feasibility studies would be the first and then if there were opportunities around our business to either replace fleet or convert fleet, we would consider that. You need to have the mine life in front of you in order to be able to justify the replacement of a mining fleet. So those opportunities may present, but it's more about presenting the base case for those very important studies we have at pre-feasibility stage.","Rob Atkinson","Chris, thanks very much for the question. And we're conservatively estimating that we're going to get a 20% improvement in productivity with the trucks in terms of the material that they can move. And that will obviously transfer to a lower cost per ton. The key areas that we'll be focusing on most of all are around the shift changes. Obviously that disappears, the maintenance requirements, the increased speed, and also the ability to get greater payloads. So all-in-all where we're sitting is about a 20% initial estimate, but obviously we're going to be hoping to push that very, very hard. And we've certainly seen some great performance in other mining companies and we certainly believe we can do that and some moving forward.","Chris Terry","Thanks. Thanks Tom and Rob. And then just in terms of the operations, thinking about the 2020 progression, Just wondered if you could highlight just sort of the quarter to quarter and half to half split. I noticed you mentioned \u00c9l\u00e9onore weak in the first quarter, obviously Musselwhite second half weighted, you've gone through a couple of the other assets, but I just wanted if you could make some comments on that. Thanks.","Tom Palmer","Sorry, just Chris, is there an operation particular you want to talk about?","Chris Terry","Just wondering in general as you go through your yearly guidance, just thinking about it, maybe first half versus second half or just items to look for on a quarterly progression. Just overall, I know you don't guide specifically to the quarter, but just things that we should look out for as the year goes on.","Tom Palmer","Chris, Tom here you are going to see a little bit softer first half to second half. You're looking at maybe softer, I mean like 48% versus 52% after half. So in my world, that's a pretty even year. [indiscernible] certainly at \u00c9l\u00e9onore has you are seeing some lower gold ounces, particularly the first quarter.","Musselwhite you're going to obviously see a lower first half to second half as we start to feed ore and we're already feeding ore and in fact Rob is being a little bit conservative. We actually produced our first gold this week from Musselwhite and we'll ramp up that plant in the second half of the year.","Just looking down the list of mine sites you're going to see in Africa, weighted to the second half of the year, particularly at Ahafo, as we start to get in some higher grade ore at Subika, they are going to be weighted to the second half of the year at Akyem as we get into some higher grade ore in their open pit, pretty even year through Tanami. Boddington, you're going start to see them get into some high grade in the second half of the year. So there's a weighting for the second half at Boddington. Pretty even through Pueblo Viejo, Cerro Negro pretty even. Merian you'll start to see them softer in the second half as we start to get into more of a high grade but harder ore and then start to price out through the primary crusher you lose mill productivity.","Yanacocha, as we get into the Quecher Main stripping campaign, you'll see a bit lower in the second half to the first. Pe\u00f1asquito, you'll start to see us move into higher grade ores in the second half. So a bit stronger in the second half.","\u00c9l\u00e9onore, I talked about. Pe\u00f1asquito a pretty even year. And CC&V, we'll start to see some high leach ounces coming through on the second half of the year. Does that give you some flavor?","Chris Terry","Yes, that's great. That's a very, very helpful. It's exactly what I was after.","Tom Palmer","And then one other Chris to keep in mind as you're looking at cash flow. We will start to ramp-up our spend on development capital as we start to ramp-up our work at Tanami 2. So you will see that that in the second half as well.","Chris Terry","Okay, great. Thanks for that. The last one from me, I mean, you've obviously done the mine divestments Kalgoorlie, Red Lake, where the portfolio stands today is there anything that's non-core? I don't think so, but I just wanted to check.","Tom Palmer","But Chris, there are 12 operations that we're going to drive value from, so you can see us absolutely focused on delivering and exceeding our commitments from those 12 operations. There are couple of areas that we're working on that aren't part of our core operations.","One is that we have a power business in Kalgoorlie that's \u2013 that we're working through, if you remember from the announcement with Northern Star, they've got first rights to make an offer for that. That's material in terms of the value of that power business.","And the other area we're doing is cleaning up our equity portfolio. So we're actively working on that. And you might see the order of, through the combination of all of those things up to a $300 million of proceeds, $200 million to $300 million of proceeds that may come from that.","So I'd call that sweeping up, but it's a material number as we work to clean house in the first half of this year.","Chris Terry","Okay, great. That's all for me. All the best for the year. Thanks.","Tom Palmer","Thanks mate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Barnes from TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Greg Barnes","Yes, thank you. Question for Rob Atkinson on Pe\u00f1asquito. Just curious on the work you're doing on the front-end of the plant and how that deep bottlenecking is improving the throughput versus when you acquired the asset to where you think you can get it to.","Rob Atkinson","Well thanks. Thanks very much Greg. And very, very clear that that's where the bottleneck is, that we're sitting at a rate of 37 million ton throughput for the year. We're looking again net up to 39 very quickly. Now that certainly isn't the end to it, but as you balance the different products between the gold and the zinc and the lead and the silver, you do have to balance the backend of the plant with the front-end.","But we've certainly been able to choke feed through that front end and we're looking at 39 million ton throughput.","Tom Palmer","Greg, are you coming to Pe\u00f1asquito next week, because we're going to go into some detail with the folks that are visiting.","Greg Barnes","Yes, I am absolutely coming and just want to jump the gun a little bit, Tom.","Tom Palmer","All right.","Greg Barnes","On full potential have you fully deployed that across all of the Goldcorp operations now? ","Tom Palmer","Rob, you want to?","Rob Atkinson","Not quite yet that we've \u00c9l\u00e9onore is very well advanced. Obviously Pe\u00f1asquito is fully advanced. That Porcupine is ramping up and given where Musselwhite is at, with the conveyor that's going to be the last one to ramp-up. But on the whole we're making very, very good progress. And, even though full potential isn't ramped up fully at Porcupine and Musselwhite, the level of engagement between our technical teams and our operational teams is very significant. So we're making very good progress.","Greg Barnes","And how about at Cerro Negro. Rob?","Rob Atkinson","Beg your pardon. The Cerro Negro was one of the first to kick off that's proceeding well and again we have a terrific SME support down there and we're focusing on some key things down there. Just a handful of things, which will make a difference and the big one is improving the development rates there and the productivity of the equipment in general. And we're certainly seeing some good early wins here.","Tom Palmer","Greg both Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro through the diagnosis and design phases and firmly into their delivery phases and so we're through that and we're into the 18-months delivery. \u00c9l\u00e9onore is now in there, they've been through the diagnosis and they're now in the design phase. So the two, the two assets that deliver significant value. And Pe\u00f1asquito delivers huge value, we\u2019re firmly in the deliver phase.","Greg Barnes","Yes, it looks like you could see that in the Q4 results. Thanks Tom.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Greg.","Rob Atkinson","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Wolfson of RBC. Please go ahead.","Josh Wolfson","I just switching over to the capital allocation side of things with the buyback, I guess half complete within a pretty short timeframe if and when that's ultimately exhausted, I guess, prior to the full sort of timelines. How do you see that that program going forward? And I guess, what's the motivation to look at allocating funds towards that versus a dividend?","Nancy Buese","Yes, Josh, thanks for the question. So, on the buybacks, I think I would consider that really tied to our asset sales. And so between that and an opportunity to buyback shares at a very, very attractive share price, we feel like that was the right thing to do. And so, we will continue that program through the end of 2020. And we will also consider \u2013 at these gold prices when we think about capital allocation, we'll continue to manage the balance sheet and we'll think about other shareholder friendly actions. Certainly a key one of those will be to determine our appropriate level of dividend on a go forward and sustainable basis. So that's something that we will continue to evaluate and truly to remember that that dividend at $1 is sustainable at $1,200 gold price, so at a more robust pricing going forward. That's something we will be definitely continuing to revisit.","Josh Wolfson","Okay. So it\u2019s safe to say I guess the approach seems to be windfall cash flow is attributable to the buyback and business sustainability is a focus for the dividends.","Nancy Buese","Yes, that's correct.","Josh Wolfson","Okay, great. Thank you.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.","Anita Soni","Good morning everyone. I'm just looking at Porcupine. Could you just talk about the changes to the reserves there? I know you moved dome from \u2013 or you said you were going to move dome from reserves into resources, but to me it looks like you've taken 8 million ounces out totally out of the global inventory. Is that correct?","Tom Palmer","Probably need to go offline with you on that one, Anita. Well, certainly, we moved some Century out of reserve into resource and we certainly kept some reserve in where we could still mine those ounces. So that might be one that we can quickly get Jason Dando and Dean to jump up the line and take you through.","Anita Soni","All right. And then when you were \u2013 you talked about or Rob talked about applying your more rigorous drill density requirements. Did you also take a look at \u2013 and this is to the overall Goldcorp, all of the assets, did you also take a look at Goldcorp's cost assumptions at this stage? Or is that still to come?","Tom Palmer","We'll get Dean to comment on that one for your Anita.","Dean Gehring","Yes, Anita, we looked at the whole suite of variables that go into calculating the reserves. So we looked at the cost assumptions and also as Nancy mentioned during her part of the presentation, we also consider best demonstrated performance. So we don't build in stretch or upside into any of our reserves or resource determinations.","Anita Soni","All right. And so given that Musselwhite perhaps won't be looking to grow as it previously did. You're okay with the cost structure that's supporting the current reserves right now?","Dean Gehring","Yes. And we also took a look at that too in terms of its best demonstrated performance.","Anita Soni","All right. And then just in terms of areas where we saw declines at other assets that you own, so \u2013 and that were within your portfolio. Can you talk about \u2013 so you had some wins at Tanami and you talked a bit about that, but could you just talk about what was happening at Ahafo South as well as at \u2013 I'm sorry, at Merian?","Tom Palmer","Again, Anita, we can probably go offline on that detail, but I mean, those Ahafo South is, is ounces coming in with the changing mining method and Merian we've got ounces coming in as we continue to drill out around the terrific story at Tanami story, here us talking more about is the Oberon deposit with the first ounces coming into resource. That's got to be a terrific addition to the Tanami\u2019s story, but I'm more than happy to maybe jump offline and go through asset by asset and take you through that detail.","Anita Soni","All right. Thank you. I look forward to that call.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, Anita.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Jalonen of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Mike Jalonen","Good morning, Tom, everyone. I just had a question. We haven't really heard much of Nevada Gold Mines. I know Mark Bristow would spoke about it. But on Page 5, your synergy value chart, Mark spoke about another $60 million of synergies in Nevada lowering the cutoff grade on his call last week. I am just wondering, do any \u2013 do those fit in on Page 5 anywhere or this was Newmont?","Tom Palmer","Yes. Mark and \u2013 terrific to get a question from you. Slide 5 is just the Goldcorp synergy. So we have built into our guidance for Nevada Gold Mines, the synergies that that Barrick have provided publicly. So that's built into our plan. But in the $500 million of cash flow that we will deliver in 2021 in the $340 million of cash flow that we will deliver this year, all of that comes from the five new operations that came into our business from Goldcorp.","Mike Jalonen","Okay. All right. I'll thank you for that clarification. So you and Greg Barton's next week.","Tom Palmer","Yes, thanks, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Graf of B. Riley. Please go ahead.","Adam Graf","Hey, everyone. Just a quick question. I'm just thinking down the line a bit longer term. You guys have some big projects that are JV-ed with some base metal producers, who have their own projects and their own balance sheet capacity. And I was just curious if you maybe could give us some color on how you're coordinating longer term with your JV partners in regards to the development and the timing of those projects considering their own \u2013 they're not benefiting from the higher gold price.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, Adam. So, one of the beauties of our portfolio as it's some \u2013 as it's now positioned is that we have across those 12 operations and the ore bodies that sit underneath them and the three projects that we have in either definitive feasibility study or executions at Tanami 2, Ahafo North and Yanacocha Sulfides, the ability to sequence those projects in. And they are the three projects that underpin the 6 million to 7 million ounces of steady development capital spend over the better part of this decade that Nancy was talking about those three projects plus the exploration potential of our existing assets and the opportunity to improve the performance of our existing assets give us a steady profiled north of 6 million ounces for this decade at least. So we'll talk more about that in the weeks ahead.","But what that allows us to do with those three big projects, Norte Abierto, Nueva Uni\u00f3n and Galore Creek, that I see sitting in pre-feasibility study, is for us to work with our joint venture partners to apply some of our key strategic mine planning methodology that we have within Newmont, understand those ore bodies to optimize those ore bodies to establish a competition for capital and see which of those come forward first because we'll only implement those in series, which of those will come first towards the latter part of this decade, if not the start of the next decade for implementation. And I think that sits pretty consistently with our joint venture partners thinking about those projects. So I think we're aligned. And the beauty of our portfolio is that we have plenty of time to really optimize those projects and bring them on and we will get from each of those projects along with Yanacocha Sulfides and excellent exposure to copper as the globe goes through the energy transition. So I'm very excited about our organic pipeline and I think we can work well with our JV partners to bring them on when they are ready to come on.","Adam Graf","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Tumazos of John Tumazos Very Independent Research. Please go ahead.","John Tumazos","Thank you for taking my question. What\u2019s the interruptions at Musselwhite and Pe\u00f1asquito and the de-classifications at \u00c9l\u00e9onore and the Yukon and Dome and the Red Lake sale. All in all, are you still happy with the Goldcorp purchase? You appeared to buy it almost at the bottom and at about 30% of what Goldcorp had spent on its assets.","Tom Palmer","John, in a word yes. It's a fantastic acquisition. Those assets are terrific ore bodies. There are \u2013 there's excellent infrastructure and they are in very good hands and we're going to deliver huge value from them. So it was a fantastic acquisition and I think we're demonstrating what those assets can really do when they're in the hands of an operating company like Newmont.","John Tumazos","Is it a reasonable hope or expectation for the \u00c9l\u00e9onore resources to come back to reserves and also the Coffee, Yukon and Dome Century resources? Or should we limit that optimism just to \u00c9l\u00e9onore?","Tom Palmer","Yes, you should be optimistic about \u00c9l\u00e9onore and the upside potential as we apply Newmont exploration skills to that asset. For Coffee, we've put that study back where it should be in pre-feasibility study and it's one of the deposits that our head of exploration is very excited about. And we want at least two seasons of drilling to prove out that ore body. And what we're looking at with the Century project is understanding what that \u2013 that next life that what that next layback is at Porcupine. So we're actively working that project at the right level to look to see what \u2013 what we can do to bring those ounces into that business. And we're working \u2013 and we'll continue to work bloody hard at Porcupine to get their productivities up and improve their costs, which will further enhance the ability to bring \u2013 essentially what will be layback back into that mine.","John Tumazos","Thank you for your service to the company.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, John.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Tom Palmer for closing remarks.","Tom Palmer","Thank you everyone for joining us and thank you for your continued interest in Newmont.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Largent, the floor is yours, ma'am.","Jessica Largent - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's third quarter conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer; Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, Chief Operating Officer. They and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to slide 2. Before we go further, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here and refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Jess. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Before I start, I'd like to take a moment to introduce our new Vice President of Investor Relations, Jessica Largent. Jess joined Newmont in 2015 and most recently served as our senior director of planning, working closely with Investor Relations. Before that, she led the IR function at Turquoise Hill Resources. She brings 12 years of mining industry experience to her new role and we're excited to have her in this key leadership position.","I also want to take this opportunity to thank Meredith Bandy. Meredith will be leaving Newmont after three successful years leading our IR function. I know you join me in welcoming Jess and thanking Meredith for her many contributions and wishing them both the best of luck.","Turning to results, I'm pleased to report another strong quarter at Newmont including reaching commercial production at our Tanami Expansion project. Tom, Nancy and I look forward to presenting the team's latest work to execute our strategy, which includes delivering consistently superior operational performance, maintaining a global portfolio of long-life assets and progressing profitable expansions and prospects on four continents and living up to our commitment to lead the gold sector in profitability and sustainability.","Turning for more details on slide 4. We delivered exceptional results this quarter keeping us on track to meet full-year cost and production guidance. This performance is the result of ongoing discipline in improving costs and efficiency and investing in growth across the cycle as production from our newest mines, Merian and Long Canyon, offsets lower production at our more mature operations.","We were also honored to be recognized as the mining industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year. Superior operational execution gives us the means to continue investing in the future.","We completed the first expansion of the underground mine and mill at Tanami safely, on budget and schedule and expect to generate internal returns of about 35%. We also announced plans to develop Quecher Main in Peru. This project focuses on mining the remaining oxide ore at Yanacocha, which will extend life until 2027 and facilitate future development of our considerable sulfide deposits. Finally, our exploration team is working on four continents to advance the next generation of Newmont mines.","Operational excellence also translates to a strong balance sheet and robust returns. We generated nearly $500 million in free cash flow, more than double the prior year quarter. We also generated adjusted EBITDA of more than $650 million and lowered our net debt to EBITDA ratio to 0.4 times. Finally, we increased our third quarter dividend by 50% to $0.075. This performance is underpinned by our commitment to running safe and sustainable operations.","Turning to slide 5. Newmont's mines continued to be among the safest in the world. With the last five years, we've lowered our total injury rates by more than 50%. We've also reduced our gold all-in sustaining cost by 22% in that same timeframe, proving that safety and efficiency go hand in hand. Last month, we were honored to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 11th consecutive year and to be ranked as the mining industry leader for the third year running.","Newmont was also rated the sector's top performer for water management, biodiversity and corporate citizenship. Index ranking is based on more than 600 data points. The way I look at it, leading sustainability performance translates into three main things, safe working conditions and good jobs for our employees, responsible economic development and environment management for our host communities and strong returns and growth prospects for our shareholders. We're proud of reaching these milestones. But we also understand there's always room for improvement.","Turning to our cost performance on slide 6. Our all-in sustaining costs were $943 an ounce for the third quarter, reflecting strong performance at operations in all regions. We continue to focus on managing the things we control, improving ore body modeling and mine planning, increasing mill throughput and recovery and leveraging technology based on its value and viability. This helps us offset the things we don't control, including lower grades at maturing operations.","Our all-in sustaining costs also reflect increased investment in exploration and advanced projects in keeping with our focus on creating long-term value. Year-to-date, all-in sustaining costs of $909 per ounce is well within our 2017 guidance of between $900 and $950 per ounce.","Turning to production on slide 7. We produced 1.3 million ounces of gold on an attributable basis in the third quarter, a 7% improvement over the prior year quarter. As I mentioned earlier, this performance is based on lower cost production at our newest mines. It also demonstrates the benefits of managing a global portfolio. Outperformance in North America and Africa has helped us overcome extreme weather events in Australia and South America. And we remain on track to deliver on our commitments.","Year-to-date production of 3.9 million ounces of gold puts us on pace to achieve our full year 2017 guidance of between 5.0 million ounces and 5.4 million ounces. Before we turn to our newest project, I'll take a moment to congratulate the team at Merian who celebrated their first full year of operation earlier this month and are hitting their stride with a new production record set during the quarter.","Turning to our newest project on slide 8. Earlier this week, we approved the Quecher Main project in Peru. This project will extend Yanacocha's mine life to 2027, add profitable gold production from remaining oxide ores and serve as a bridge to future growth options, including developing Yanacocha's extensive sulfide deposits. Quecher Main is designed to maintain Yanacocha's gold production at about 200,000 ounces per year at incremental all-in sustaining costs of between $900 and $1,000 per ounce.","We've improved our development capital to between $250 million and $300 million to develop a new oxide deposit and heap leach facilities. We expect to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019 and will update our guidance in December. The project will leverage Yanacocha's current infrastructure and defer certain reclamation costs while creating a platform for future growth.","Turning to our longer-term growth options on slide 9. In North America, we're advancing Long Canyon Phase 2 as well as multiple underground expansions at Carlin. And we're working with Goldstrike to explore the Plateau property in the Canadian Yukon where we have an agreement to earn up to 80% equity through exploration investment. Plateau now covers more than 660 square kilometers of stake (08:58) land. And the team completed airborne geophysical surveys and nearly 3,000 meters of diamond drilling this summer.","In South America, we continued to see favorable drilling and process test results at the Yanacocha sulfides projects in Peru. And very encouraging results at Chaquicocha from our drilling program there. Our newest prospects are not included in either Quecher Main or Yanacocha sulfides projects.","We're also working with Continental Gold to support safe and efficient development of the high-grade Buritic\u00e1 project in Colombia. Earlier this year, we acquired a 19.9% stake in Continental which will help fund the new mine and give us exposure to both their and other people's exploration properties in Colombia.","In Africa, we're advancing studies to develop underground deposits at both Ahafo and at Akyem. And we're working with a local partner, (09:54), to explore greenfield opportunities in Ethiopia. This photo shows the airborne system we launched last week in Ethiopia to begin geologic mapping. Finally, in Australia, we're pursuing our second expansion at Tanami and exploring greenfield prospects around both KCGM and Tanami.","With that, I'll turn it over to Nancy to discuss our financial performance.","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","(10:20) had a positive quarter with robust cash flow generation and a stronger balance sheet. Slide 11 covers financial highlights. Revenue improved 5% to (10:33) driven by higher sales from our new operations at Long Canyon and Merian. Adjusted net income was $183 million or $0.35 per diluted share. And adjusted EBITDA was $653 million. We improved our quarterly operating cash flow by 35% to $688 million and more than doubled our free cash flow to nearly $500 million ending the quarter with $3 billion of cash.","Turning to slide 12 to review our earnings per share in more detail. Third quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $0.39 per share, up 22% from the prior year quarter. Primary adjustments included a $0.01 gain related to the sale of equity interests, a $0.01 net gain related to the acquisition of Boddington in 2009 and a $0.02 gain related to certain tax items primarily evaluation allowance on deferred tax assets. Taking these adjustments into account, we delivered adjusted net income of $0.35 per share.","Turning to capital priorities on slide 13. Operational execution, capital discipline and a strong portfolio continue to give us the platform to execute our priorities including investing in profitable growth, returning cash to shareholders and maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet. We continue to self-fund profitable projects allowing us to grow margins, extend mine life and improve reserve quality. We are also returning more cash to shareholders. This week we announced our third quarter dividend of $0.075 per share which is up 50% from the prior year quarter.","In July, we fully repaid $575 million of convertible notes further reducing debt and simplifying our capital structure. Taking this into account and with the free cash flow generated during the quarter, our total liquidity is nearly $6 billion and net debt to EBITDA is at 0.4 times.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Tom Palmer to cover operational highlights starting on slide 14.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Nancy. Shifting our focus to our regional performance. In North America, our teams are delivering solid results and advancing profitable expansions. In South America, we're recovering from difficult weather earlier this year and expecting a stronger second half. And we're also investing in growth at Yanacocha.","In Australia, we continued to set record for mill throughput and recently reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion. And in Africa, we continued to deliver exceptional results primarily due to Full Potential improvements in throughput and recovery and remain on track with our Ahafo expansion projects.","Turning to more on North America on slide 15. Our operations are delivering strong results and have produced about 1.7 million ounces of gold year-to-date. This puts us on track to offset the deficit caused by a slide at the Silverstar mine in late 2016. We're now working to de-weight Silverstar as a first step in gaining access to the ore that was covered by the slide. And this production represents upside for 2018 and 2019.","At Carlin, we're delivering strong second half results. A successful ground rehabilitation allows us to ramp up production at Leeville. Our Northwest Exodus expansion also continues on course and we recently commissioned power and ventilation systems.","Some of you visited our Nevada operations last month and saw the semi-autonomous mining equipment at work in Leeville. We'll also use this technology at Northwest Exodus which is being designed to support autonomous operations. Long Canyon and Cripple Creek & Victor are also performing well and we've accelerated leach pad placements at both operations.","Finally, our new Twin Underground mine is underway. Grid development began a month ahead of schedule and we mined first ore in August. This project is expected to improve mill recovery, extend processing life at Twin and reach commercial production in mid-2018.","Turning to South America on slide 16. Our operations have turned the corner after the extreme weather impacts of the first half of the year and we're well positioned for a strong fourth quarter. As Gary mentioned, we achieved record production at Merian in August with steady improvement in mine productivity and continued strong performance at the mill.","Construction of our new primary crusher is advancing on course and will be completed as we reach fresh rock in the second half of 2018. And we plan to launch our Full Potential program at Merian in the fourth quarter to identify and deliver further value.","At Yanacocha, operations have dried out and the team remains on track to meet 2017 production guidance. However, we're now processing higher cost deep transition laws (15:39) at Yanacocha. And we've increased our exploration and advanced project spend in the region. As a result, we're raising our 2017 all-in sustaining cost guidance for the South America region by 7%.","As Gary mentioned, we approved the Quecher Main project earlier this week. This project will extend mine life to 2027, giving us time to progress and optimize our approach to developing Yanacocha sulfides. We'll have an update for you on this project in December.","Turning to Australia on slide 17. During the quarter, Boddington achieved its fourth month of record mill throughput for the year, helping offset slightly lower grades associated with moving into the south pit layback.","At Tanami, the team has done a great job overcoming the impacts of record rainfall earlier this year and is on track to deliver a solid fourth quarter. We also want to congratulate the team for achieving commercial production at the Tanami Expansion safely, on budget and on schedule despite the impact of challenging weather conditions earlier this year. I'm also pleased to report that the mill is already performing above nameplate capacity.","At KCGM, we are remediating a slip in the west wall of the Fimiston Pit. We expect to complete this work in 2018 and the team continues its work to offset the impacts in 2017. We also completed mill maintenance in the third quarter that was originally scheduled for the fourth quarter. Lastly, we've completed metallurgical testing and confirmed the recovery model for our Morrison layback at KCGM. And we expect to reach a decision to proceed in the first quarter of 2018.","Finally, turning to Africa on slide 18. The region continues to outperform due to mill throughput and recovery improvements delivered through our Full Potential program. This allows us to improve our 2017 cost outlook by about $90 per ounce for Ahafo and about $40 per ounce for the entire Africa region. Ahafo expansion projects are progressing well. Civil works to support the mill expansion are advancing on course and we're mining ore and building surface infrastructure for the Subika Underground mine.","We've also received confirmation from the government that the favorable terms of our investment agreement had been extended for another five years at Ahafo, which supports our view that Ghana is a stable operating jurisdiction. Finally, we continued to advance our regional growth studies which center on developing underground resources at both Ahafo and Akyem as well as a potential new mine at Ahafo North.","With that regional overview, I'll hand it back to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, Tom. Turning to slide 20. Newmont is anchored in four regions where we have the stability and resources we need to continue investing over time. More than 70% of our production and about the same amount of our reserves are located in the United States and Australia. We continue to fund the high-margin projects to sustain future production and improve our return on capital employed. These factors position us to maintain stable returns over the next decade and beyond.","We continue to optimize and deliver profitable projects. Turning to slide 21. For the past three years, we built Merian and the first phase of Long Canyon on time and 20% below budget. We reached commercial production at our Tanami Expansion this quarter and will finish Northwest Exodus next year, both expansions add profitable production and service platforms for further exploration.","We also announced decisions to fund four expansion projects this year that will improve profitability and extend mine life at Ahafo, Twin Creeks and Yanacocha. Taken together, the nine projects we've approved over the last three years will add annual gold production of up to 1.7 million ounces at all-in sustaining cost of about $750 per ounce for the first five years and generate an average internal rate of return above 20%.","Turning to our project pipeline on slide 22. Our pipeline is among the best in the gold sector in terms of depth and capital efficiency. And it gives us the means to maintain steady production while growing our margins and our reserves.","Projects included in our outlook are the current and sustaining capital projects you see here, Morrison in Australia, Northwest Exodus and Twin Underground in Nevada and the Subika Underground and Ahafo Mill Expansion in Ghana. Midterm projects that will improve our outlook are shown in green, Ahafo North in Ghana and the Tanami power project in Australia.","Finally, we continue to invest in advancing our longer-term projects shown here in dark blue. Tanami power is a new addition to the project pipeline, which I'll describe on slide 23. At Tanami, we're optimizing a project to shift from our current reliance on diesel fuel, which is trucked to the site, to natural gas that's delivered by pipeline. We'll contract with experts to construct the pipeline and two power plants and expect the project to take about 18 months to build and commission.","The Tanami power project is expected to create value by significantly reducing power costs and carbon emissions and by improving supply reliability and scalability. We expect to reach a funding decision later this year.","Turning to our longer-term production profile on slide 24. Our gold production is forecast to remain at about 5 million attributable ounces for the foreseeable future. And we continue to advance our mid- and long-term projects to sustain profitable production in the outer years.","In short, Newmont has a stable asset base with considerable upside. We've provided a seven-year production profile in keeping with our focus on long-term value creation. And we believe this outlook differentiates Newmont. Our focus on long-term value creation shows up in our leading reserve profile.","Turning to slide 25. Over the last 16 years, we've added more than 123 million ounces to our reserve base by the drill bit at a cost of just $24 per ounce. And half the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by our geologists. Our reserve profile compares favorably to the gold sector average with 129 ounces per 1,000 shares and operating reserve life of almost 12 years and more than 70% of our reserves located in the United States and Australia.","We have a proven track record of converting about 80% of our resources into reserves. And this year, we plan to invest more than $200 million in our exploration program to build on that success. We also have more than 50 years worth of drilling results or more than 40 terabytes of information in our exploration database. This along with our proprietary exploration technology represents an unparalleled asset.","Putting everything together. Four years ago, we launched a new strategic direction and a new era of productivity, performance and growth at Newmont. Going forward, we'll continue to execute our strategy but with an eye on the longer-term horizon.","We'll demonstrate superior operational execution through safe, stable and profitable long-term gold production, continuous cost and productivity improvement and one of the strongest teams in the mining industry. We'll sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets by delivering ongoing margin growth, leading project development and exploration results and a positively differentiated reserve base.","Finally, we'll establish ourselves as the frontrunner in terms of profitable and responsibility through ongoing capital discipline across investments and cycles, superior balance sheet strength and dividends and our ability to create and protect value through leading environmental, social and governance performance.","Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question we have will come from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was just wondering, you mentioned the Morrison layback and that presumably is going to add ounces to the reserve base next year. Could you give us a bit of color on what ounces we can expect from that, maybe costs and maybe if there's a difference to the recovery that we've been seeing from the existing ore reserve there?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Sure, John. In terms of Morrison, and we haven't yet approved it. It's a sustaining capital project. So, basically, it's about extending mine life. And we've been going through a process. In fact, we delayed approval probably about three or four months, did additional drilling, really focused on metallurgical testing. Tom and I were just out there a couple weeks ago and had a chance to kind of go through where they're at with the project. And the results look to have confirmed what we would have expected from metallurgical recoveries, which is good. And as we get further information together on that, that's one we can provide an update on in our December update when we have Alex Bates, the Regional Vice President, out at Investor Day to provide an update.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So the recoveries are going to be lower than we've seen previously?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","No, no, no. It confirmed we'd see good recoveries there. That's what we wanted to confirm and we see that coming through fine.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, fine. And then we've seen the first reserve reporting last night. How are you feeling about the reserve exercise that you're busy going through at the moment? Just wondered where you think you could be adding reserves this year.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Well, it's still early days as we look around where we've been focusing. We had a target, I think, we put out to the market in terms of about 3 million ounces by the drill bit. And we continue to see how that delivers both at Tanami where we see potential, Subika and potentially also down at Yanacocha.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yanacocha.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I've got Grigore here in the background whispering at me. Merian as well.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So Yanacocha would be the Quecher Main material coming in, would it?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. It could be more resource there with the Chaquicocha at this stage.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Oh, of course. You were having some success with another layback there, right?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Correct. In terms of looking at it, though that's not included in Quecher Main at this stage.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And you were reiterating that the sulfides were coming on well. Any new developments there?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Nothing new. Tom and the team \u2013 actually, Dean Gehring will be providing an update at the Investor Day in December.","John Bridges - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, cool. Looking forward to it. Thanks a lot. Thanks, guys. Good luck.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, John. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next we have Michael Dudas of Vertical Research.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Good morning, everybody, and welcome, Jessica. First question is \u2013 Gary, we're going to get a lot more information on the long-term outlook in December. But how do you see going into the budgeting for 2018 and beyond, any cost inflation, vendors starting to raise prices, offsets to what Full Potential could provide from an operating basis to maintain the strong cost performance you guys have had through the downturn?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Now, Michael, as you say, Full Potential continues to be a core to the business in looking at both efficiency and cost improvements. And I think with the focus and what the team has been working on here as we pull together our 2018 business plan, we'll be able to demonstrate that with the guidance in December as we present it.","In terms of inflationary pressures, the key things we keep an eye on; obviously, the Aussie dollar is one element that we don't control directly and we see that flow through. As gold prices come up, that's come up a little bit. But that's pretty much kept in line there with the price. Oil price, it's been bouncing around. We've been using $55. We continue in our outlook going forward to be pretty much in that same ballpark. I think the only place \u2013 as we keep an eye is labor inflation and watching turnover as the leading indicator on that both in Australia and parts of North America. It's not any sort of a big jump up, but it's one we're keeping an eye on. Remember, overall, our focus. We build in in our planning process 3% a year inflation into the plans as the teams are developing their plans out for the first five years. So 3% each year. And the objective of the Full Potential effort is to at least offset or more than offset that 3% inflation. So in terms of other areas, mining equipment and supplies, we've extended our agreements, so not seeing anything in a major way there inflationary-wise. And likewise on the commodity inputs.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","In the trip out to the mines in Nevada last month, I enjoyed working the joystick on the semi-autonomous equipment. As you look forward and you're developing expansion to the mine plans or new mine plans, how much greater those types of equipment and concepts are going to be to put forth in the new generation of mines or to help for Newmont as you move forward?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, I'll take a brief shot. And then I'll have Tom Palmer give an update because he's got an extensive background in designing autonomous mines and give a little bit more background. But I think in terms of designing mines, it's clearly all part of the technology that we look at. We look at the value it delivers. You look at what we're developing at Northwest Exodus where we've allowed for. And we'll have autonomous equipment in use there. We have it already in use at Leeville right next door. So that's easy technology to transfer and at Subika. It's not limited by location. We're looking at Subika in Ghana as another place to use the autonomous equipment. And a good example there; you can put operation of that equipment, as you saw, up on the surface. And you don't have to go through the travel time back and forth to the face (31:24). You don't have to have the same clearing procedures after a blast. So it leads to higher productivity. And these are things we'll look at really at all of our operations. On the surface side, I'll hand it over to Tom to give a little bit of background.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Gary. I think my experience with this technology and automation is, first and foremost, it's fundamentally safer. You're taking human beings out of the process and the system runs without some of that risk. And to build on Gary's comment, the other thing it does, it can take people out of an environment, say, an underground environment where they're not exposed to the same level of things like diesel particulates. So there's a health improvement there as well as safety, first and foremost.","In terms of the design of our mines, our underground mines going forward, as we talked about with Northwest Exodus, are designed to accommodate autonomous equipments. So we've got the option to bring that in. The surface mines, it's really something you look at as you go forward. My experience with this type of equipment in the iron ore industry is there was a capital offset when you're building a new mine to bring that equipment in. And the cost of running that equipment is still something that needs to catch up. So retrofitting or introducing autonomous equipment into existing mines is still something that we're looking at and considering. But there's still some work that the industry has to do to have a cost improvement that'll allow you to do that retrofit. So we're keeping an eye on those developments.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Well, I trust Caterpillar is working hard on that from their end as well. I appreciate your thoughts, gentlemen. Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Next we have David Haughton of CIBC. Please go ahead.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary, Nancy and Tom. Thank you for the update. Now just going over to Quecher Main. Can you just give us a bit of an outline about the throughput you expect, the grade and whether the material would be processed via the heap leach or the mill and what most of the CapEx would be dedicated to? Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","David, we just happen to have RSVP here. And I'm going to introduce Dean Gehring who took over now about four months ago as the Regional Vice President and I'll have him handle that question. Dean.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Dean Gehring - Newmont Mining Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Gary. David, it's a good question. Quecher Main is just largely an extension of what we've been doing at Yanacocha for a number of years. Most of the capital is dedicated toward just building a new leach pad facility. We'll largely use existing equipment. The grades are similar to what we've been mining before in that area. And it's reflected in our guidance and some of the things that Gary said earlier about what we expect to see in terms of production. So it's all going to be oxide leach production. There isn't anything that's going to our gold mill.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay, so all oxide leach. And what do you think the stacking rate might be there?","Dean Gehring - Newmont Mining Corp.","Well, we put in about 16-meter lifts. We'll be doing two a year. So you'll see about 32 meters of stacking per year.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","What does that translate into tons, please?","Dean Gehring - Newmont Mining Corp.","I have to look that up because if I gave it to you in tons, then it wouldn't necessarily tell you what it was in meters. So different people ask the question differently.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Because I'll tell you how I model it. I model it on tons, grade, recovery and that gets me ounces. I don't know what meter lifts mean.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","But I think at the end of the day, David, you can count \u2013 it's going to add about 200,000 ounces a year on a 100% basis once it starts production later in 2019.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Now maybe one for Nancy. Debt retirement in the quarter, you still got $3 billion of cash. Have you any thoughts of additional debt repayment going forward?","Nancy K. Buese - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah, David. As we look at our maturities, we've got one set coming due in 2019 and a bit coming due in 2022. We continuously do liability management work around those tranches. And at this point in time, with where those are trading, it does not make sense for us to do early retirement. But we'll continue to evaluate that. Our current plan would be to pay those tranches off with cash on hand at the time that they mature.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for that.","Operator","The next question we have will come from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Good morning, everybody.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning, Tanya.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Gary, questions for you, if I could. Thank you very much for the Tanami power project that you're talking about. Just wanted to get a little bit more information there. I know you're mentioning going from diesel to natural gas. Can you just remind me what your power costs are currently now, where you think they'll go and what percentage of your cost structure is power?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. I'm having folks help draw that up here because I don't have that at the tip of my tongue. So let's find that and I'll come back here in a moment.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","All those mines and you don't have them there? It's getting -","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","We have them there. I just don't have it in my memory banks at the top.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. Well, then maybe, Gary, another question for you. Just coming back to Twin Creeks. I know we talked about negotiations with Barrick and I know I ask you every quarter. But December is coming. It's not too far away. How are the negotiations going on trying to resolve an amicable contract between the two to get the mineralization through your Twin Creek autoclave?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","No. We continue to talk with our partner there about what the potential would be for the extension of this agreement. We're also working through as they're assessing different expansion plans and how to take the next step of expansion effectively and efficiently at Turquoise Ridge. So that work continues.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","And I think they mentioned on their call that you're going to make a decision on that in January of next year. Is that correct?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I believe that's what they're targeting is a January capital decision on that expansion.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. And just coming back if we have those and maybe just also the capital. What are we talking about in terms of the Tanami power from 35,000 feet, just sort of the range?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I'm going to hand over to Tom. I believe he's got both the cost number in terms of power costs and he can \u2013 we'll give more detail on the capital as we get a little bit closer to approval, which will be by the end of this year. But over on the power.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, Tanya. The roughly $0.25 kilowatt hour power cost today, diesel-fired power stations at Tanami. And with gas coming in, gas-fired power stations, you can expect to see in the order of 20% improvement there. So other key factors are that the reliability \u2013 we won't to see those same issues that we experienced earlier this year with diesel supply and quite a significant improvement in carbon emissions as a result of the cleaner fuel source. So I'm very pleased about that. In terms of -","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","And what percentage of \u2013 yeah, and what percentage of your cost is -","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","It makes up about 25% of our costs...","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","...power generation.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay. So that would be the impact from that.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","And you could get that in, I think Gary said, in about 18 months once the decision is made.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. Once we got the approval to proceed, we dropped the \u2013 there's a north-south power line that runs up through Alice Springs in Australia. So you connect to that and then run across to the mine site. So that's the order of a 400, 450 kilometer pipeline. And we'll run that right through to the underground mine at DBS and then connect to power stations. If you recall, the processing plant and the underground mine are around 45 kilometers apart. So (39:45) connecting power lines and join those two up. So it's around that time to \u2013 critical path is to sink that power line. So you can imagine the conditions up there through the dry and wet season. You've got to sequence around that. So that's sort of timeframe to get it into place.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","So you're talking at least towards the end of 2019, early 2020?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Possibly a bit earlier, Tanya.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","All going well, the weather looks after us; I'd see that we'd be up and running a bit earlier than that.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotiabank","Okay, so in the 2019 frame. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. I look forward to getting that capital number.","Operator","The next question we have will come from Lucas Pipes of FBR Capital Markets.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning.","Lucas N. Pipes - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Gary, I had a bigger picture question for you. And yesterday, I was on a Freeport call that lasted very long about the issues they're dealing with. Obviously, you have exited Indonesia, but it's not just Indonesia. I think when you look across the industry, kind of resource nationalism is a problem. And how do you think about that? Am I wrong in that assessment? And then more importantly, as you think about your portfolio longer term, is it changing the way you want to allocate capital? Thank you.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","No. Thanks for the question, Lucas. I look at it a couple of different ways. One, I think in terms of how the industry presents itself to the world from a cost standpoint. The effort to go to all-in sustaining costs was a step in the right direction to try to get a better view out to the world in terms of what the actual cost of production is. And for the most part, we've stayed very true to what that means. That hasn't necessary been the case everywhere. But I know the World Gold Council is taking another look at that approach and making sure that we get a true measure and metric of what the cost of production is out there. And not everything's represented even in all-in sustaining costs. So I think making sure we get the right view on cost out's important because the first thing people look at is what gold price is and what the cost numbers are and say they want a bigger piece of the pie.","I think in terms of where we operate, I think we've got very stable regions that we operate in. That doesn't mean we're immune. I know we had the recent efforts in Western Australia to look to raise the royalty rate. And I think that's been a big process and congratulations to the team. At this stage, Alex Bates and the team, they're working with the other gold producers in Western Australia to help educate the politicians in Western Australia and the rest of the marketplace in terms of what the effect of raising royalty rates has. And this is consistent whether it's in Western Australia or anywhere else in the world. If you raise the cost of production through having higher royalty rates, it raises cutoff grades and reduces mine lives. So it's not good for long-term investments. You have to have fair share in your revenues. And I think just being more transparent about what is being shared and improving on that, that's something I know we're working with ICMM. We look at our own reporting of taxes. We have our social responsibility report. We provide that information. But I think that's a key area.","On top of that, we've got agreements with governments. You just heard the extension of the agreement in Ghana for five years as a good example of having an agreement where they've been very consistent and lived up to that, a little different than our experience was in Indonesia. And we've got agreements in Peru and agreements in Suriname as well. So I think it's working with the government officials and making sure they understand what our economic situation looks like and what the impact can be in the long term on mine life, community and jobs at the end of the day.","Lucas N.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Largent, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jessica Largent","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont Goldcorp's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, Chief Executive Officer; Tom Palmer, President; and Nancy Buese, Chief Financial Officer. They will be available to answer questions at the end of the call along with other members of our executive team.","Turning to slide 2. Please take a moment to review the cautionary statements shown here, and refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmontgoldcorp.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary on slide 3.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Jess, and thank you for joining our call. We delivered strong performance in the second quarter, and continued our work to establish Newmont Goldcorp as the world's leading gold business.","Highlights for the quarter included: closing the deal to acquire Goldcorp with the overwhelming support of our shareholders; making steady progress on integrating assets and aligning teams with our proven strategy; completing an historic joint venture with Barrick to create the world's largest gold-producing complex; and meeting our ongoing commitment to deliver leading operational, financial and sustainability performance.","Turning to the details on slide 4. The first pillar of our strategy is to deliver superior operational execution. In the second quarter, we produced 1.6 million ounces of gold, and delivered all-in sustaining cost of $1,016 per ounce, and continued to improve cost and efficiencies across the portfolio.","We're on track to achieve a run rate of $365 million in annual improvements from the Goldcorp acquisition by early 2021, and we launched our Full Potential continuous improvement program at Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro. This program has delivered more than $2 billion in improvements since 2013.","The second pillar of our strategy is to sustain a global portfolio of long-life assets. During the second quarter, we approved the Awonsu layback to extend the life at Ahafo's open pit mine. We supported the completion of the Nevada Gold Mine's joint venture, and we continued to advance profitable projects including the Ahafo Mill Expansion, Quecher Main and Borden, all of which will reach commercial production later this year.","The third pillar of our strategy is to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. In the second quarter, we returned $590 million in dividends to our shareholders; maintained a strong balance sheet with an investment-grade credit rating, and nearly $5 billion of liquidity; and we were recognized as one of the top companies in the world for our leading social, environmental and governance performance. This performance starts with running safe operations.","Turning to slide 5. While our combined safety performance improved in the second quarter, we remain focused on achieving zero harm across our portfolio. That focus includes, reporting and sharing significant events that hold the potential to impact safety and embedding our fatality risk management program to test the controls we have in place to prevent accidents and injuries.","Over the last six months, we've also been driving efforts to eliminate live maintenance work as another effective way to protect our people from injuries. We were honored to be recognized as one of the world's leading corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility Magazine, and the only mining company to make the list for our performance. This recognition is a tribute to the commitment our teams bring to leading sustainability performance and a key measure of how well we run our business.","Turning to a look at our global portfolio on slide 6. Our operations are based in four regions and managed under our proven operating model. Taken together, Newmont Goldcorp offers investors, an unparalleled portfolio of mines, projects and reserves in favorable jurisdictions. In fact, 90% of our reserves are based in the Americas and Australia.","Sustainable gold production, targeting between 6 million and 7 million ounces per year with another $1.5 billion of annual revenue from copper, zinc, lead and silver production and the financial flexibility needed to continue investing in profitable growth and delivering an industry-leading dividend.","Finally, we offer strong leadership and a wealth of technical expertise to make the most of these assets. I visited \u00c9l\u00e9onore and Porcupine last week and I was pleased to see the progress the teams are making to align and integrate these operations and the ongoing work by the combined teams to make the Nevada gold mine's joint venture a success.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tom on slide 7 to discuss our operational performance and recent integration work.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, Gary. Before reviewing our operational performance and integration work, I'd like to take a moment and welcome Rob Atkinson, our new Chief Operating Officer, who you will hear from next quarter. Over the past 25 years, Rob has delivered step-change improvements in safety, productivity and sustainability in the mining sector.","We are excited to have Rob on board, as he brings a demonstrated commitment to building strong safety cultures and to leading and empowering teams to achieve meaningful business results. With his capability and experience, Rob's addition to our leadership team will help to drive the delivery of value we have identified through our combination with Goldcorp.","Now beginning with a review of our regional performance on slide 8. Our North American operations were impacted by near-term challenges in the second quarter. The performance is expected to improve in the second half, as we work to fully integrate the Goldcorp assets and set them up for sustainable future success.","At Pe\u00f1asquito, operations safely ramped back up in June and concentrate inventories are almost back to normal levels. During the shutdown, the team brought forward maintenance on various plant and equipment. The remainder of 2019 and into 2020, grades are expected to steadily improve as we complete the stripping campaign in the main Pe\u00f1asco pit. And we also launched our Full Potential Program at that operation and I'll touch a bit more on that later.","On June 17, we began good-faith dialogue with a trucking company in the Cedros community. And just last week, the team hosted a session on-site. The stakeholders were able to see firsthand the focus we have on environmental compliance, order efficiency, social development and long-term community water plans and more.","At Musselwhite, the rehab of the conveyor ramp is around 70% complete. Secondary egress has been successfully established, allowing us to recommence both development activities and work on the materials handling project earlier this month.","The focus for the remainder of 2019 will be on replacing the conveyor system and using this period as an opportunity to get ahead on development work. At \u00c9l\u00e9onore, we have begun accessing higher grade in the Horizon five zone and preparations are underway to launch Full Potential in the fourth quarter. We also continued to advance materials handling project to improve productivity from lower levels of the mine.","At Porcupine, the Borden Project remains on schedule to reach commercial production in the fourth quarter. And at Red Lake production at Cochenour was ramping up in the second quarter. However, in early July, we proactively paused the underground operations in order to strengthen our controls following an in-depth review of a historical underground area.","Partial underground operations resumed a few days later, following the implementation of additional controls. And over the course of this quarter, we'll be installing some further control measures and expect to return to full underground operations during Q4.","Turning to CC&V. We delivered steady production during the quarter and have signed a toll milling agreement with Nevada gold mines to continue processing concentrate in Nevada. In the second quarter, our Nevada operations performed as planned with Carlin safely completing its annual shut on Mill 6. And on July 1, we closed the Nevada joint venture and Barrick assumed operatorship of the Nevada gold mines. We look forward to working together and supporting the joint venture's efforts to unlock significant value over the years ahead.","Turning to South America on slide 9. Yanacocha delivered another solid quarter, with continued higher grades in the Tapado Oeste pit and drawdown at La Quinua leach pad. And at Merian continued productivity improvements helped offset seasonal wet weather.","At Cerro Negro, second quarter performance was in line with our expectations. And we anticipate a stronger second half as we reach higher grades from the Eureka and Marina Norte.","We launched Full Potential earlier this month, with the focus on improving development and mining rates, maximizing recoveries and applying our asset management methodologies at that operation.","Looking forward, Quecher Main continues on schedule, with commercial production expected in the fourth quarter. Turning to Australia on slide 10, Tanami, delivered another solid performance coming off higher grades in the first quarter. And we are starting to see the cost benefits from the transition to natural gas-fired power.","Boddington continues to progress the stripping campaign in the South Pit and expects to reach higher grades in Q4. We recently advanced our autonomous haulage study, with the potential to reach a full funds decision later this year.","If approved, the project is expected to improve cost and mining productivity, by converting the fleet of 39 haul trucks to autonomous operation, using the Cat command system.","At KCGM, geotechnical remediation work on the east wall of the Fimiston pit is ongoing. We are starting to see production from the Morrison starter pit. And expect to reach higher grades in the second half.","And Tanami Expansion 2 continued advancing towards a full funds decision in the second half. Engineering works are ongoing. And shaft sinking has progressed beyond the 150 meters.","Turning to Africa, on slide 11, Akyem again delivered strong quarterly production on the back of higher grades. And new Full Potential initiatives associated with optimizing grounding and improving recoveries.","At Ahafo, we continue to benefit from higher grades in both the Subika open pit and underground. We recently approved funding for further laybacks of the Awonsu pit. And while we anticipate first gold from these laybacks in the fourth quarter of this year, the majority of the benefits flow from 2024 to 2029.","These laybacks extend the life of Ahafo surface mines by another four years. And the Ahafo Mill Expansion is nearing completion, with commissioning expected to start next month and commercial production in the fourth quarter, keeping us on course for a record year, in Africa.","Following our review of geotechnical assumptions at the Subika Underground mine, we are assessing mining methods for the low levels of that mine. As we conduct this review, we are mining more laterally and as a consequence have reduced our 2019 outlook by approximately 40,000 ounces.","Looking forward, at Ahafo North, we continue to work through the permitting process, engaging with the relevant government agencies and building upon our relationships with traditional leaders and local communities.","By putting it all together, we delivered 1.6 million ounces and all-in sustaining cost of approximately $1,000 per ounce in the second quarter. With our global and balanced portfolio, allowing us to overcome headwinds at select sites with continued solid execution across the rest of our operations.","Turning to a review of our operational outlook on slide 12, our 2019 guidance includes a full year for the Newmont operations, including a full year for our Nevada sites and a partial year for the former Goldcorp operations, from April 18 to December 31.","Now outlook has been updated, to include the impacts from the blockade at Pe\u00f1asquito, the conveyor fire at Musselwhite, the installation of additional safety controls at Red Lake and the impacts from the slip in the Gold Quarry pit at Carlin in late 2018.","2019 is second-half weighted as we ramp-up the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Borden projects and reach higher grades at Cerro Negro, Pe\u00f1asquito and \u00c9l\u00e9onore.","Sustaining capital of $985 million, includes investments in tailings storage facilities, expansions at Ahafo and Pe\u00f1asquito, VLF2 leach pad expansion at CC&V in addition to infrastructure equipment and ongoing underground mine development throughout the portfolio.","Development capital of $575 million includes payment in Ahafo Mill Expansion, Quecher Main, Borden and conveyor remediation works at Musselwhite. In summary, we expect to deliver 6.5 million ounces of gold, an all-in sustaining cost of $975 per ounce in our first partial year as a combined company. This operational outlook does not include any of the benefits that will flow from our Full Potential work at Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro or from supply chain improvements where we are actively progressing work.","Turning to slide 13 for a look into our early successes. We have made excellent progress in the first 90 days of integration. On the G&A front, we recently completed our organizational design work, to resize the Vancouver office from a corporate headquarters to a regional office. This work has already captured $40 million per annum in labor savings to date. We have realized a further $10 million per annum in non-labor G&A synergies through the consolidation of insurance and benefit programs real estate and other quick wins. We have commenced the next phase of this work, which shifts the focus from Vancouver to target duplication across the operating businesses.","Turning to our supply chain work. Newmont's experienced supply chain team is actively chasing value across several fronts. Quick wins are being achieved through the extension of best pricing and rebates and we are also leveraging our increased scale and volume to seek improvements on some of the input costs.","Our Full Potential program is well underway at Pe\u00f1asquito recently kicked off at Cerro Negro and we're preparing to launch at \u00c9l\u00e9onore in the fourth quarter. At Pe\u00f1asquito, Full Potential began in early June, and we have our key subject matter experts on the ground working with the site team focused on opportunities in the areas of mining, processing, asset management, G&A and external spend.","Another example of applying our technical expertise to turn these former Goldcorp assets around is our strategic resource development program. This program lays the groundwork for future business plans of testing an extensive set of mine plan options across a wide range of interrelated variables.","The output from this work ensures that we are pursuing the optimal development and value path for operations. At Musselwhite, our strategic resource team is working with the site to understand the entire value chain and review critical trade-offs in physicals financials and risks to develop the best value for that operation.","In summary, our structured approach to delivering value heads us well on our way to achieve the cash flow improvements of $365 million per annum. We expect 40% of the improvements to be realized this year ramping up to 80% next year, and 100% by 2021.","Looking further ahead at our project pipeline on slide 14. Another key value proposition in our combination with Goldcorp is our industry-leading project pipeline. Leveraging our project delivery track record it provides the opportunity to establish a foundation for steady production and cash flow for decades to come. This pipeline gives us significant flexibility and we will continue to advance only those projects that meet our minimum hurdle rate of 15% at a $1,200 gold price.","As previously mentioned, we recently approved the Awonsu layback and this project is now shown in execution along with Musselwhite materials handling, and the three projects we expect to complete in the fourth quarter this year:","Ahafo Mill Expansion, Quecher Main and Borden, it's also worth noting that we shifted the Coffee project from definitive feasibility to pre-feasibility as we take a step back to perform further exploration confirm the resource advance permitting activities and improve our understanding of the asset.","As part of our integration and annual planning work, we will continue to evaluate all projects through our rigorous and disciplined investment system. I look forward to providing updates on our project portfolio as well as our optimization work on the six former Goldcorp assets to deliver long-term value as we move ahead.","With that, I'll hand it over to Nancy on slide 15.","Nancy Buese","Thanks, Tom. Turning to Slide 16 for the financial highlights. Before we jump in, it's important to note that results reflect the performance of Goldcorp assets from April 18 until June 30. In the second quarter, we delivered revenue of $2.3 billion which increased 36% over the prior year quarter with the additional sales from Goldcorp assets and higher realized gold prices; adjusted net income of $92 million or $0.12 per diluted share; and adjusted EBITDA of $679 million, a 25% increase over the prior year quarter.","Cash from continuing operations was $301 million, a decrease of 25% driven by lower net income and higher accounts receivable at Boddington and Pe\u00f1asquito with Pe\u00f1asquito concentrate shipments recommencing in mid-June and port congestion at Boddington that delayed shipments near quarter end. Outstanding concentrate receivables at these two operations was more than $150 million, which we expect to collect in the third quarter. Those movements also contributed to a free cash flow decrease of approximately $220 million over the prior year quarter along with higher investments in development projects.","We have collected $45 million of insurance proceeds related to the conveyor fire at Musselwhite of which $14 million was recorded as an offset to cost applicable to sales in the second quarter. As you will see in our detailed results, there are specific accounting and policy differences for the newly reported Goldcorp assets, including a reset in the basis of assets and liabilities to fair value and our changes to reporting for differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP and the adoption of Newmont accounting policies.","Some of these items include differences in the classification of certain investments as sustaining our development capital, the exclusion of resources and the calculation of depreciation expense and the impact on cost applicable to sales without deferred stripping costs. Other notable differences include coproduct accounting at Pe\u00f1asquito, changes to the accounting for the mine's Silver Stream contract and the inclusion of Cerro Negro's Argentinian export tax in our AISC calculations.","Turning to slide 17 for a review of earnings per share in more detail. Second quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $1 million. Primary adjustments included $0.16 comprised of $0.14 related to transaction and integration costs from the Goldcorp acquisition, such as severance payments, legal and banking fees and consulting costs; and $0.02 related to the Nevada joint venture transaction including cost related to defense; $0.04 related to reclamation and remediation charges at legacy Newmont sites; $0.05 related to a change in the fair value of equity investments; and $0.04 related to gains from the sale of exploration properties in North America. Taking these adjustments into account, we recorded adjusted net income of $0.12 per diluted share.","I want to take a moment to thank the Newmont Goldcorp finance team and all the work they've accomplished to support the successful integration of the businesses in coordination with Barrick to successfully transfer ownership of our Nevada assets to the joint venture. As a reminder, our results for the third quarter will proportionately consolidate Newmont Goldcorp's ownership interest in Nevada gold mines for the terms of the joint venture agreement. We will present these results as a separate segment in our financial statements including the various elements of the P&L for disclosure purposes.","Turning now to slide 18. We remain well positioned to execute our capital priorities including maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet, investing in the next generation of mines to improve margins and build a stronger reserve base and return cash to shareholders. Newmont Goldcorp has one of the strongest balance sheets in the gold sector, supported by a cash balance of $1.8 billion even after paying off $1.25 billion of outstanding Goldcorp debt at closing and returning approximately $590 million to shareholders in the second quarter.","After the completion of several key financing activities in April, including a reset of our five-year $3 billion revolving credit facility and a successful exchange of Goldcorp notes, we maintain financial flexibility with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times. We also demonstrated our continued commitment to returns through a special dividend of $0.88 per share and a common dividend of $0.14 per share.","Wrapping up with our 2019 corporate outlook on slide 19. We continue to invest in our future to secure the long-term stability of our business. For 2019, our support cost outlook is $325 million, which includes a portion of synergies from the Goldcorp combination, but also contemplates managing the Nevada operations from our Elko regional office through June 30. We are on track to deliver an annualized run rate of $85 million in G&A savings for 2020.","Our interest expense is expected to be $280 million from our new debt profile and our depreciation and amortization outlook is just over $2 billion.","Investment and exploration in advance projects is expected to be $450 million with near mine and greenfield exploration occurring across all regions and ongoing investments in advanced projects as we progress in the next phase of future growth. Finally, our consolidated adjusted tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 34% to 39% using a $1,200 gold price.","Going forward, Newmont Goldcorp is well positioned to continue a trajectory of industry-leading financial performance by executing our capital priorities and staying focused on long-term value creation.","And now I'll hand it to Gary to wrap-up.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Nancy. Turning to Slide 21. Newmont Goldcorp delivered a strong first half in 2019. We are well-positioned to build on that performance in the second half and for decades to come.","We will continue to focus on generating long-term value for our shareholders by executing our strategy which is to deliver superior operational excellence by focusing on safety and a culture of continuous improvement; sustain a global portfolio of long life assets by investing in the next generation of mines technology and leaders across our business; and to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility by maintaining high standards and living up to expectations of how a leading business should operate.","I'll end by saying thank you to our team and to our investors for your support. It has been an honor to lead Newmont Goldcorp. I'm proud of what we've accomplished together over the last seven years and I'm excited about the future for the business.","I have great confidence in Tom and his new leadership team as he takes over the reins as CEO on October 1st and I have great confidence in this team's ability to build on a strong foundation and advance Newmont Goldcorp's position as the world's leading gold company.","Thank you for your time. And with that I'll turn it over to the operator to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Bridges of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","John Bridges","Thanks. Good morning Gary, Nancy, Tom. It's been great working with you Gary. Best of luck in your new endeavors. I was just wondering with the new accounting Nancy that you spoke of how much of the lower earnings are related to that? The change in the loss of deferred stripping and the more conservative accounting. Have you thought about the impact that we've seen with these results as a result of the accounting?","Nancy Buese","Yes, thanks John. And absolutely that's something that we wanted to telegraph very early on because we knew there would be some significant differences. I would say the difference between IFRS and U.S. GAAP is probably the most material piece and we'd be happy to walk you through those in a bit more detail. And then certainly some changes between policies and as we've talked about the difference between development versus sustaining CapEx is probably the key piece of it as well as the co-product versus by-product accounting at Pe\u00f1asquito.","So, yes, that's probably a fairly material difference in the way you would have seen things reported at the Goldcorp level and we're very comfortable walking folks through the details of those to help make sure you're bridging to the way we'll be accounting for those going forward. But yes, our goal was not to surprise the market with that, but we've tried to telegraph that there would be some fairly material changes.","John Bridges","And then one of the things that seems a little bit counterintuitive is the switch from being able to depreciate underground mines against the reserves and resources. Now, I understand that just using reserves as per GAAP is a more conservative way of working, but it seems impractical particularly as you and other miners become more focused on underground mines. What's your thought on that? And would it be possible to lobby the SEC to change that?","Nancy Buese","Yes. Totally understand the request there and we don't disagree with you. However, we are settled a bit by the requirements of U.S. GAAP. so that might take more than just Newmont's desire to turn that around. But we totally understand the thoughts, but U.S. GAAP really requires us to only use reserve life to calculate depreciation.","John Bridges","Right. And then just if I may Subika, you mentioned that there's been a change in the mining plan there. What's going on?","Tom Palmer","John, it's Tom here. I'll pick that one up. As we look at some of the ongoing work and looking at some of the stresses as you move into the depths deeper into that mine, we're seeing higher stresses. So we're taking a step back to look at our mining method particularly the type of backfill we might need for that. So as we step back and understand that we've just moved out of mining laterally, so we can work through that mining plan -- mine planning process through the course of the business planning process this year. So, I'd expect as we move through to provide our longer-term guidance at the latter part of this year that we can provide more insight into that. But it's how we've managed higher stresses in that mine as we move into some of the deeper parts of it.","John Bridges","Okay. Great. Thanks. Best of luck Tom in the new role and best of luck Gary and others. Thank you.","Tom Palmer","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Terry","Hi Gary, Tom and Nancy and all the best for you Gary and Tom in your new role. A couple of questions from me. Just starting on the new guidance, the 6.5 million ounces for 2019 taking into account the -- from April on the Goldcorp assets. How do we think about that number you provided in the context of the ongoing Full Potential program from here and as you transition into 2020 and moving forward? Is that a number you've largely reset as such and then you'll build from that with any optimization on Full Potential? Or can we still think about 2020 and beyond as still pretty fluid depending on the outcomes of your review of the assets in the coming six months? Thanks.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Chris. Tom here, I'll pick that one up. Look, the approach that we take with all of our operations and the Full Potential approach we take in coming in and running full potential at those operations is to start with previous best demonstrated performance and understand what you've done in the past and then building a plan on that basis that's underpinned by a robust resource model is then feeding a mine plan.","And then we start to build some stretch in that in terms of the improvement. That's the starting point that Full Potential has as it comes into Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro and \u00c9l\u00e9onore as well as our existing or former Newmont operations. So that's the basis at which we have worked with our 14 operations to develop our guidance for this year and that's the process that we're using to build our business plans for 2020 and beyond for Newmont Goldcorp.","What we do with full potential is when we have a Full Potential Program we go through a diagnosis phase and then a development phase. Coming out of a development phase, you then have a series of projects that have clear value delivery linked to them, resources and accountabilities and a time frame. It's only when we have those clearly defined projects in place that we build them into our plans and our guidance.","So as I said in my comments, you won't see Full Potential benefits built into our 2019 guidance because that work is only just starting at Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro. We would expect to see some of those benefits for those two sites flowing into our 2020 business plan and our 2020 numbers. So we're very disciplined and rigorous in the way we look at our mine plans and the way we apply our Full Potential Program.","Chris Terry","Okay. Thanks Tom. And then just thinking about the medium term, so should we expect our updated guidance on forward years from late this -- later this year? And what's the sort of updated timing on any divestments in that prior sort of 6 million to 7 million ounce range that you talked about in the last quarter? Thanks.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Chris. I'll pick up the first part of your question and pass it across to Gary for the second part. We're right in the middle of our normal annual business planning process at the moment. That's the standard process we run through as we walk through that process and present our business plan to our board in the latter part of this year for approval. We'll then follow-up with longer-term guidance and we're currently targeting our standard time frame of December to be sharing that with you.","Gary Goldberg","And just to follow-up on the divestment question. Just a reminder there was no need to do any divestments as part of this acquisition and the whole process that we've gone as we work with Barrick to support and develop the Nevada joint venture.","So we want to make sure we get in, get a good look at all the operations and projects that we brought in with the Goldcorp acquisition to make sure as we did with Newmont five years ago -- or five to six years ago in terms of going through all the assets to make sure they're delivery as strongly and as well as possible before we move forward with that process. So that's where we're focused.","Chris Terry","Thanks Gary. And the last one from me, just on a couple of assets specifically, on Musselwhite and pushing out the timeline on the repair work there. Should we assume that that can ramp up pretty quickly in 2020? Or is it too early to say what the impact might be on that year? And then for Pe\u00f1asquito specifically as well, did the blockade have -- I was just wondering if you could go through a few more details on the impact that that had on perhaps mining inventory levels, other factors around the mine as well just to think about the second half and going forward? Thanks.","Tom Palmer","Chris, Tom again I'll pick both those up. So at Musselwhite, the fire damaged the full 2.5-kilometer conveying systems. So it's a process of rehabbing say after removal the damaged structure and rehab the ground control, a 2.5 kilometer decline. We are well advanced 70% complete on that rehab work.","I was at Musselwhite a few weeks ago. I will just say that's work in progress and they're doing an excellent job in terms of ensuring that they're setting up that rehab for the long-term in a mine that has a very long life.","We're right in the throes now of assessing bids for the fabrication installation of a new conveyor. So ultimately our timing will be determined by those bids coming in, so we'll gain greater understanding of that in the coming weeks. It will be in the 2020 though before that conveyor system commissioned and up and running.","We are back in working on the materials handling project. That project was well advanced when it was paused because of the fire, so it's -- we're very much getting the final stage of that project and we'll be moving through, commissioning in the latter part of this year and having it ready and available in the New Year as that conveying system comes up.","Our focus at Musselwhite is to ensure that there is the appropriate level of development work that we have the appropriate number of stopes open and then we have the drifts out to do the exploration work to map out the future of that mine, so that when we have that conveying system up and running we have the appropriate number of open stopes and the ability to be able to maintain the appropriate number of open stopes going forward.","So I fully expect that when that mine comes back up, when that conveying system comes back up, it will come up very smoothly and we'll be able to hit our -- whatever the appropriate rate is out of that mine very smoothly and quickly.","In terms of Pe\u00f1asquito, as a result of that blockade there were no impacts on the operation itself. It was managed in a -- very appropriately in a care and maintenance situation and we did a lot of maintenance work through that downtime period. It also has ramped up very smoothly. We have been able to move -- concentrate to market very effectively, although as Nancy indicated both Pe\u00f1asquito and Boddington have a little backlog of concentrate sales from the second quarter that will flow into the third quarter.","The concentrate inventory levels by now are back to normal. The mine is running well. The plant is running well. The impact on the second half of this year will still move in the higher grades for gold, silver and lead. Grade stay about the same for zinc. As a result of the 50-day shutdown, we'll see some of those higher grades that we're expecting in the fourth quarter to move into 2020 and so we'll see that in our 2020 guidance as we bring that out later in the year.","Chris Terry","Thanks Tom. That\u2019s all for me. All the best to you and Gary. Thanks.","Tom Palmer","Thanks Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Fahad Tariq of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Fahad Tariq","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the Goldcorp synergies for a second. Can you clarify the cadence of the synergies? I thought, I heard you say 40% this year, 80% next year and 100% by 2021. And if that's the case this year, is it right to say that none of that 40% of the $365 million would be full potential? It's all coming from G&A and supply chain? Just some clarity around that would be helpful.","Tom Palmer","Tom again I'll pick that one up. You're pretty much spot on. So a lot of the early quick wins from G&A, which we're seeing now and we\u2019re still more to pursue as we move from Vancouver out to the operating sites. There's the quick wins that come from supply chain in terms of rebates extensions for the Goldcorp -- equipping the Goldcorp site. So you just see quick wins in supply chain and G&A, with G&A being the lion's share of that 40% this year.","You'll then start to see next year both supply chain improvements in full potential flow, as we start to deliver on improvement projects at Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro. And then as we move through the other Goldcorp assets through the course of next year, you'll start to see the remainder of that flow, primarily from full potential with some additional supply chain. So G&A, some supply chain, Full Potential really kicking in in 2020-2021.","Fahad Tariq","That's helpful. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, any surprises or anything interesting you've learned so far from the Full Potential work at Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro? Anything that has been different than, perhaps your initial assumptions when you first did the due diligence on the mines? Thanks.","Tom Palmer","No surprises from our due diligence. There is everything that I expect to say that we are seeing, and I think there's the real the value proposition of Newmont's operating model sitting and having these six Goldcorp assets come into our operating model, and seeing the journey that we've been on places like Boddington and Tanami applied to operations like Pe\u00f1asquito and Cerro Negro absolutely have water, and there's nothing's changed in my mind in terms of what we saw during due diligence and what we've seen over the first 90 days of running these operations. There's a need for technical rigor and discipline. We bring that. We've got key technical expertise. We're seeing some real opportunities in the full potential space.","I think in Pe\u00f1asquito, and I'm heading down there this afternoon, particularly the interface between the mind and the mill, which we see and have continued to pursue at Boddington. We see the real opportunities there at Pe\u00f1asquito. And Cerro Negro is going to be really focused around mining and development rights underground. There's a real opportunity there. We believe we have the skills and expertise to bring the improvements in that space at Cerro Negro, so no surprises at all.","Fahad Tariq","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Barnes of TD Securities. Please go ahead.","Greg Barnes","Thank you. Tom, just listening to what you're saying about the development at Musselwhite and have the folks there just to get that ahead of what you have been I suppose. Is that a continuing theme you're seeing across the Goldcorp operation, that just wasn't the development work done or stripping required to meet the needs of the mills? Is that the biggest problem in your mind?","Tom Palmer","To be frank Greg, yes. There was not the work done on exploration. There wasn't the work done on development, and that's absolutely fundamental in either open pit or underground mine. So, as we look at Musselwhite, Musselwhite had one stope open before the fire. That's unacceptable. We will not have...","Greg Barnes","Now, how many would it need, Tom?","Tom Palmer","It depends. We have to do our work on understanding the value, but you'd expect the mine the size of Musselwhite with the size of their stopes to have, five or six stopes open at any one time. So, before we recommission that conveying system, we expect to have the development work done to not only have six stopes ready to go, but the stopes have come beyond those and the exploration drifts to be beyond those too.","I mean that's a real -- I mean, Musselwhite is our Tanami in Canada. So we need to be out in front of the mining work to be doing the exploration work to be mapping out that future potential of that operation. So that's -- our focus is now that we've got secondary egress is to be in there doing the development work, so that when the conveying system is ready, we can maintain the appropriate level of throughput through that mine, but also be doing the work to understand its future life.","Greg Barnes","So was that similar lack of development of Cerro Negro and \u00c9l\u00e9onore as well?","Tom Palmer","It's a similar thing. The thing we saw through our due diligence was the opportunity for us to come in and apply our rigor and discipline and operating model to those operations.","Greg Barnes","How long Tom, do you think it's going to take you to get these operations to where you want them to be?","Tom Palmer","Again as we talk about, as we marketed this transaction, there is 24 months, possibly at the 36 months for some of those operations to really get them to the level of performance that we would expect. It's a very similar journey. If you look back over Newmont over the last six or seven years, and we're at Boddington or at Tanami was back in 2012 or 2013 to where it is today, there's a good two, three years of work to get those operations set up for sustainable long-term value delivery.","Greg Barnes","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carey MacRury of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","Carey MacRury","Hi. Good morning. Just got a question on Cerro Negro and \u00c9l\u00e9onore. Cerro Negro I think that tonnes throughput in the quarter is around 3,400 tonnes. I know Goldcorp was pushing 4,000 tonnes. And I think you've talked in the past about maybe that was too aggressive. And I'm just wondering should we assume a run rate similar to Q2? Or sort of what throughput expectations should we expect over the balance of the year and similarly on \u00c9l\u00e9onore?","Tom Palmer","Thanks Carey. So you won't hear us talk about tonnes per day out of the former Goldcorp operations. You'll hear us talk about \u2013 it might be tonnes per year, but you'll certainly hear us talk about what's the highest value or the best value out of those operations. In terms of the Cerro Negro, we are moving into a couple of higher-grade zones in \u2013 so you'd expect to see both higher grade and increased volume coming out of those underground mines in the second half, which is going to contribute to a back-half-weighted Cerro Negro for 2019. Similarly, for \u00c9l\u00e9onore you are moving into some higher-grade areas of Horizon five or six that will help back-half weight El\u00e9onore for this year.","Carey MacRury","So should we assume that the rate of \u2013 before going into the mill will be more variable going forward or \u2013 ","Tom Palmer","No, you'd expect the right going through the mill to be consistent going forward. But what we'll be focused on is what's the combination of buying a mill that's going to deliver the best value for those operations that will be a change in language you can expect to hear from Newmont Goldcorp.","Carey MacRury","And again for the balance of the year is that going to be similar to Q2 or is it going to be different in Q2? Obviously, you've mentioned higher grades in the back half.","Tom Palmer","Yes. Essentially one thing to remember second quarter didn't start with all these Goldcorp assets. We didn't start accounting for them until April 18. So that wasn't a full three months of production so keep that in mind when you look at the numbers.","Carey MacRury","Okay. And then maybe one other question on 2019 clearly there's a lot of issues this year with the Pe\u00f1asquito and Musselwhite fire. I think your previous pro forma guidance for 2020, 2021 is 7.4 million to 7.5 million ounces. Is there anything that you've seen so far that you think those numbers would change materially? Or more or less do you think you can still get to those certain numbers again barring any improvements from the full potential?","Tom Palmer","Carey, we're right in the middle of our planning process at the moment. And as I talked earlier in terms of \u2013 we stepped back and ensure, we understand the resource model that's underpinning mine plans to resource risk, the investment in exploration we need to do to be managing our resource risk and then building mine plans off the back of operating assumptions that are based on previous best demonstrated performance and then have improvement built into those. So we're going back to those technical fundamentals for all 14 operations across Newmont Goldcorp. And as we're building those production profiles and then starting to move into the cost and so on and so forth, we're seeing production profiles consistent with what we expect to come into this transaction.","Carey MacRury","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tanya Jakusconek of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.","Tanya Jakusconek","Good morning, everybody. I think that's me. Just wanted to \u2013 I have to shorten my name. I just wanted to \u2013 Gary first of all good luck to you on your next adventure. It was really great working with you. All the best. Just on a few things from myself. Maybe Tom just coming back to Ahafo just on the Subika Underground appreciate your talking that you see additional more stresses than you were expecting as you go deeper. Can you just let us know is this just in a certain portion of the ore body that this is occurring why you will have to adjust? Or is there is a general for the whole ore body?","Tom Palmer","It's for the Subika ore body, Subika Underground ore body. It is a general increase in stress as you move through depth. So it's then stepping back and saying what's the mining method that best suits that stress condition and what's \u2013 and associated that what's the appropriate backfill? So as we step back and look at that we are starting to look like a mining method that might be more bulk top mining, which ultimately I think as we're working our way through that has the opportunity to extend the life of Subika Underground because it will give us access to more ore.","So, it's about working through understanding that stress mining method. And then looking at the upside opportunity of that changing mining method. But it's generally as you move, a depth metal body is seeing higher stresses. And therefore we have to think about how we -- what's the best mining method to match those.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And when will that work be done by?","Tom Palmer","We're doing that work now. It's being built into our business plans for this year and going forward. So, we would expect to see that incorporated into our long-term guidance, so that we'll come out with it in December.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And then just on -- so that was the change in Ahafo guidance that we saw from your previous guidance. And is it safe to assume all of the change in the Nevada guidance was a Gold Quarry adjustment?","Tom Palmer","That's correct. So you saw at Ahafo, we're mining laterally rather than heading down. So that's the impact there.","Tanya Jakusconek","Yeah.","Tom Palmer","And yes, that's the 70,000 ounces that we've been indicating from the Gold Quarry impact from the slip last year is. What you're seeing as take up in that guidance for our Nevada our assets that we just issued.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And then maybe just on -- coming back on the Goldcorp assets, clearly your statement on the fact that, there's lack of underground development to sustain these assets at these -- longer term and just have to catch up.","So Tom, if this is the case how confident, are you on the guidance that you gave us for 2019? Like, do we have enough development to meet the guidance numbers you put out?","Tom Palmer","Yes we do. And I'm very confident in the guidance numbers we've put out. We have applied Newmont rigor to arrive with those numbers. And I'm very confident in those numbers.","Tanya Jakusconek","That goes to underground operations?","Tom Palmer","Yes.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay.","Tom Palmer","So, in some instances, 10-year, the development's there for now. But i.e. but at Tanami, we have great control drilling out three years in front of us with a 10-year life out in front of us. That's the expectation that I have for these Goldcorp assets as well.","So it's -- some -- the example I gave at Musselwhite is here now. And there are other examples where we need to make sure, we're managing these assets for the long-term.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. So meeting the 6,600 tonnes a day at \u00c9l\u00e9onore 4,000 at Cerro Negro you have the stopes you need to make that for this year?","Tom Palmer","We have development work required to meet our production guidance for this year out of those former Goldcorp assets.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And then maybe on Pe\u00f1asquito, just on the open pit, you said it ramped up nicely. Is it grade -- are you seeing improvement in grade in the Q3 in the month of July? Are you starting to see that?","Tom Palmer","You will start to see improvement in grade across gold, silver and lead coming through. Yes. We're seeing it in the third quarter. And then you'll see it kick up more in the fourth quarter. So as you're going to see more of that in the fourth quarter than the third. But yes we are seeing that coming through from that mine as expected.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. So no surprises right now for Pe\u00f1asquito? I'm sorry. I didn't ask on the throughput. Is the throughput back to 110,000 tonnes a day?","Tom Palmer","We'll have the throughput to deliver our guidance for 2019.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. Okay, look forward to seeing that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anita Soni of CIBC. Please go ahead.","Anita Soni","Hi. Good morning, everyone. And just in terms of the capital guidance, I think you've talked about it a bit. But I was just trying to figure out, how do I think about 2020 given the guidance that you have for this year?","So, I guess my first question was -- and would someone address that -- with Goldcorp undercapitalizing. But it sounds like there needs to be a catch-up in capital. So, if I was looking at this would it be fair to just basically annualize the numbers that you put out given that this is about three quarters of the year for the Goldcorp assets for 2019?","Tom Palmer","Anita, Tom here. So that's a fair assumption.","Anita Soni","All right, and then, just moving on to Cerro, so then Cerro Negro would be -- given that it's sort of an $80 million -- I'm sorry not $80, $70 million going forward. For three quarters of the year we're looking at $100 million per ounce at Cerro Negro, between development and sustaining capital?","Gary Goldberg","Yeah. I think Anita, at this point in time that's a good estimate to make. As I say, we're right in the middle of our planning process at the moment. So, we'll be able to give you better guidance on that when we have our numbers later in the year. But for now, I think that's appropriate.","Anita Soni","Sure. And then maybe, Nancy, you can give me some clarity on the demarcation between development capital and sustaining capital? I understand Goldcorp was not as conservative as you guys are, but I'm just trying to understand what the $40 million in development capital at \u00c9l\u00e9onore is related to. I mean is that just catching up you're calling that catching up on underground development work is that what it is?","Nancy Buese","Anita, I don't have the details on that specifics, but I will double-check on that for you. I think it's really as you captured it it's a more conservative view from Newmont's view and things that we would consider sustaining CapEx versus development.","Anita Soni","I'm just trying to understand where you still draw the line though at that development capital. Is it -- I mean historically people would think of development capital as growth-related capital and it doesn't sound like you guys are forecasting any growth for Goldcorp assets?","Nancy Buese","Right. So again it's a policy difference and we would be more conservative in that view. And it would take under our definition of development capital we'll probably have a bit more in terms of our hurdle to get through before we would call it that. So I think that's really the biggest difference. And again we can walk you through some of the details of that offline if that's helpful.","Tom Palmer","As an example \u2013 Anita, Tom here. You do have in that development capital number for this year the material handling system at Musselwhite. Sorry\u2026","Anita Soni","Yes. And I understand \u2013 related to Borden -- Porcupine is probably related to Borden. I guess the Musselwhite, I'm just trying to understand the \u00c9l\u00e9onore and Cerro Negro or presumably there's been a lot of growth coming down the pipe or there's no real big projects happening it's just a matter of catching up on sustaining.","So just moving on to Pe\u00f1asquito. And maybe you can help me out with this offline, but it does look like you already had pretty good grades going into this quarter. Throughput was obviously low and recoveries were obviously low. And I was just trying to understand on the recovery side of the equation are you confident with PLP in the guidance that they had put -- that Goldcorp put out for about 80% recovery rates coming out of gold in the PLP circuit considering that it only did 57 this quarter? I mean how much of that was related to the shutdown and how much was a rebound?","Tom Palmer","Yes, Anita I wouldn't look at the numbers out of this quarter for those few days and draw any conclusions because in commissioning the facility brings some lower-grade material higher carbon material through that so -- to get it back up and running again. So a key part of my visit down -- heading down there this afternoon is just to understand how that whole circuit is performing including PLP and that they've got the plans in place to deliver on their commitments for production this year from all circuits in the processing plant at Pe\u00f1asquito including PLP.","Anita Soni","Okay. And I mean the grade already in the quarter though was I think was decent, I'm just kind of struggling through the ounce -- the change between ounces and short ton and your methodology. But it does look like it's around 0.8 gram per ton material in the historical sense of the way Goldcorp reported it. So just I'm just wondering why you decided to put higher-grade material through the mill and the recoveries were low.","Tom Palmer","Yes, I wouldn't look at a few days' operation this quarter and draw any conclusions. It was really ramping up facilities. So it's -- even now where only a couple of weeks even with the big processing plant layback a couple of weeks into July. I'm glad things settled down and so how the Q3 numbers look like.","Anita Soni","All right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Gary Goldberg for closing remarks.","Gary Goldberg","Newmont Goldcorp delivered solid second quarter results. And we will look forward to an even stronger second half as we continue to lead the gold sector in profitability and responsibility. Thank you for joining us and for your interest in Newmont Goldcorp.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","John Seaberg","Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Richard O'Brien, President and Chief Executive Officer; Gary Goldberg; Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Russell Ball, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our executive leadership team. ","Before we begin, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement on Slide 2. We will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks as further described in our SEC filings which can be found on our website at newmont.com. ","And now I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien.","Richard T. O'Brien","Thanks, John. For those of you on the webcast, we'll begin on Slide 3. As we announced last year during our Investor Day in New York, we continue to focus our efforts on offering shareholders a combination of competitive production growth and returns, exploration upside, balance sheet strength and a commitment to return capital back to shareholders. ","Our first quarter financial and operating results supported our efforts in each of these areas, with consolidated revenue of $2.7 billion, up 9% from the prior-year quarter; operating margins, up 29% on a 22% increase in the average realized gold price of $1,684 per ounce; stable gold production of 1.3 million ounces; operating costs well within our guidance; and a 75% increase in our dividend over the prior year's quarter to $0.35 per share. We are maintaining our 2012 outlook for production, costs applicable to sales and capital spending. ","Regarding our exploration upside, we continue to see the potential to add the equivalent of 90 million ounces of gold to reserves between 2011 and 2020. And in 2011, as disclosed previously, we made significant progress by adding 11.6 million ounces of gold to reserves or approximately 10% of that target.","Our balance sheet continues to strengthen and to provide additional financial flexibility. We recently took advantage of favorable debt markets to raise $2.5 billion of senior notes, to repay borrowings and replenish the balance sheet. Russell will speak to this in a few moments.","Turning to Slide 4, as many of you know, our growth potential includes a number of new projects, including the Akyem project in Ghana where construction is now 40% complete and going very well. Our growth potential also includes our Conga project and other projects in Peru. ","As most of you have heard, the Conga project's environmental impact assessment, which was previously approved by the central government of Peru in October 2010 after an extensive public engagement process, was subject to a review by independent experts during the first quarter of 2012 at the request of the central government. The results of the independent review were released last week and confirmed that the EIA met Peruvian and international standards. The report also goes on to recommend, among other considerations, that we assess the technical and economic feasibility of relocating the Perol waste dump in order to try to preserve the Azul and Chica lakes. We are currently in the process of evaluating the recommendations contained in the independent report and additional recommendations from the government to assess the future impacts on the project's economics.","Conga is a significant investment in Peru and would be, we believe, a catalyst for economic and social development in the Cajamarca region, while also protecting water quality and providing year-round water availability for downstream users. ","Conga's development would be a significant source of revenue for the government of Peru, along with significant employment. We've been privileged to work in Peru for more than 20 years, and we want to continue to be part of the government's social inclusion efforts and the development of the country through responsible mining.","If Conga cannot be developed, though, in a safe, socially and environmentally responsible manner while also earning our shareholders an acceptable return, then we will reallocate that capital to other development projects in our portfolio, including opportunities in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Indonesia, and we can combine that with a possible return of additional capital to shareholders.","Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our first quarter financial and operating results.","Russell D. Ball","Thanks, Richard, and good day, everyone. Slide 5 contains the financial highlights, what I consider a solid quarter with a nice positive in regard to operating costs. ","Adjusted net income of $578 million, or $1.17 a share, was slightly ahead of expectations, driven largely by those lower operating costs. A reconciliation of adjusted net income to net income reported under U.S. GAAP is included as an appendix on Slide 22 and reflects a $71 million charge, net of tax benefits of $4 million, for discontinued operations from an increased accrual related to the Holt property royalty. More detail on this can be found in Note 10 on Page 11 of the 10-Q. And in addition, a write-down of $24 million in marketable securities acquired through the Fronteer acquisition in 2011, net of the miscellaneous asset sales.  Cash from continuing operations of $613 million for the quarter was off 38% from the year-ago quarter, largely due to working capital changes. I'll provide some color on this shortly.","Moving to Slide 6, attributable gold production of 1.3 million ounces is essentially in line with a year ago despite a much lower contribution from Batu Hijau. Gold costs applicable to sales of $620 an ounce, while up 11% from the year-ago quarter, were approximately $20 an ounce below budget for the quarter. More on that in a moment. Our gold operating margin continues to expand with a 29% increase to $1,064 an ounce on a 22% increase in the realized gold price to $1,684 an ounce. ","Slide 7 provides more detail on the decrease in operating cash flow from the year-ago quarter. As you can see, we benefited by almost $400 million from a higher realized gold price. However, this was offset by lower copper revenues due to lower production at Batu Hijau, with the realized copper price essentially flat. We had a net increase in working capital of $377 million due to $100 million increase in stockpile and leach pad inventory on hand and a similar increase in dor\u00e9 and concentrate receivables on hand at quarter end.","And finally, the balance of the working capital change was due to a decrease in accounts receivable of almost $200 million in early 2011 related to the collection of late fourth quarter 2010 concentrate sales from Batu Hijau. More detail on working capital changes can be found in Note 22 on Page 24 of the 10-Q.","Slide 8 outlines the drivers of the 11% increase in CAS from the year-ago quarter. The higher realized gold price added $16 an ounce due to highest [ph] workers' participation in Peru, an increase in royalties tied to the gold price and the higher allocation of cost to gold from copper at Batu Hijau and Boddington where we allocate operating costs on a coproduct basis. Higher spending added $12 an ounce largely in the form of higher labor and contracted services. Byproduct credits were $10 an ounce lower, largely due to lower silver price and also lower silver volumes for the quarter. Higher-than-assumed diesel costs added $9 an ounce, with a stronger-than-assumed Australian dollar adding $7 an ounce net of hedge credits. And finally, lower sales volumes due to the lower production at Batu Hijau and an increase in inventory on hand added about $9 an ounce.","You should expect a renewed focus on cost reduction going forward. When we think about costs, we think about them across the entire product life cycle, from exploration to advance projects, operating costs and G&A. Look for more details on our efforts in this regard at our Analyst Day to be held in New York on May 23.","Turning to Slide 9, we continue to return capital to shareholders through our gold price-linked dividend policy. Based on a realized gold price of $1,684 for the quarter, the board approved a second quarter dividend of $0.35 a share payable on June 28 to holders of record at the close of business on June 12. The dividend represents an increase of 75% from the year-ago quarter and a resulting yield of approximately 3% based on today's share price.","Finally, I would like to take a minute to comment on our capital structure in light of our very successful debt capital market transaction in March. First, a quick bit of history. In 2011, we repaid $217 million of our 8 5\/8% debentures and completed the Fronteer acquisition for cash outlay of approximately $2.1 billion. The first quarter of this year, we repaid $517 million in convertible senior notes and $105 million in debt related to the refractory ore treatment plant in Nevada. ","With interest rates at near record lows, we decided to access the debt capital markets to refinance some of that debt we had retired over the last 2 years, and at the same time, to term out our debt profile. We raised net proceeds of just under $1.5 billion due in 2022 at a pretax cost of 3.5% and just under $1 billion due in 2042 at a pretax cost of 4 7\/8%. The debt raising provides significant financial strength and flexibility to deliver on our growth profile through a combination of strong operating cash flows in the current gold price environment, cash on hand at the quarter end of approximately $2.6 billion and a solid investment grade credit rating.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Goldberg, our Chief Operating Officer, to discuss the regional performance in more detail and to provide a project update.","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks, Russell. From a safety perspective in the first quarter, we incurred 6 serious injuries and no fatalities to our workforce.","On Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia-Pacific region was offset by increases in North and South America, while Africa's production was down slightly due to production of slightly lower-grade material in line with the mine plan. Those production impacts were reflected in our CAS, with APAC incurring the largest increase in CAS as we spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau across a lower production base.","Turning to Slide 11, our North American production was 489,000 ounces in the first quarter, up slightly from a year ago due to new contributions from underground mining at Exodus and Pete Bajo in Nevada, along with higher leach placement at La Herradura and the start of production at Noche Buena in Mexico. CAS was $613 per ounce, down just slightly from a year ago due to lower inventory drawdown costs. Recall that a year ago, Newmont was in the final stages of remediation at Gold Quarry, so in the first quarter of 2011, we mined less material than in 2012. ","Looking to Q2, we expect to complete repairs at the Leeville vent shaft by June. Additionally, I'd like to remind you that the second quarter production is historically Nevada's lowest quarter, and it will be again this year, due primarily to annual scheduled maintenance at the Mill 6 roaster in Nevada, which usually lasts about 30 days. Over the last couple of years, it has been roughly 10% to 20% lower production than the other 3 quarters of the year. The impact of this downtime has been incorporated in the full year gold production outlook for Nevada of 1.725 million to 1.8 million ounces.","Turning to Slide 12, you'll see an update on North American projects. At Emigrant, which is part of our Nevada expansions, we currently expect commissioning in July. Development of the Vista 7 vein at Twin Creeks is also on track, and we expect it to make a small contribution beginning in the second quarter. The Phoenix Copper Leach pad construction is nearly complete and ore placement has begun. Construction of the solvent extraction electro-winning plant is scheduled to begin in late 2012.","Turning to Slide 13, I'll round out my discussion of Nevada growth projects with Long Canyon. Based on the work conducted by Fronteer, as well as our work since the acquisition, we continue to believe in our original investment thesis that Long Canyon holds the potential to grow beyond 3x to 4x Fronteer's estimates. We are confident because our drilling results, and you can see a plan view on Slide 13, has doubled the extent of the known mineralization from 1 kilometer to 2 kilometers along strike which, when you look on the slide, is in the northeast, southwest, upper-right, lower-left direction, along the length of the ore body, with mineralization remaining open along strike. In addition, a number of new targets which are outlined on here, dotted and dashed in red, have been generated that will be drilled in 2012. ","For 2012, we're planning to complete approximately 70 kilometers of infill, extension and district exploration drilling, with the objective of completing an associated pre-feasibility study to declare first NRM in conjunction with our 2012 year-end reporting.","Finally, and importantly, we submitted our plan of operations during the first quarter to maintain our aggressive push-forward on the project, representing a major step in securing the necessary permits. The scope for this submission calls for both leach and mill operations.","Turning to our South American region on Slide 14, Q1 attributable production of 201,000 ounces was 26% higher than a year ago as we processed some higher-grade material from the El Tapado pit and it's also in alignment with our mine plan, which more than offset some lower leach pad production during the quarter. CAS decreased with higher production, partially offset by higher labor, diesel and workers' participation costs and lower silver byproduct credits.","Moving to Slide 15, our Asia-Pacific region delivered 442,000 ounces of attributable gold production in the first quarter. This was down 15% from a year ago due to lower production at Batu Hijau, which I've already discussed, and combined with no maintenance at Kalgoorlie and Waihi. We also need to mention that Boddington in the first quarter production was lower than planned due to an extended mill maintenance shut and a subsequent conveyor drive motor failure for a day that decreased our production for the quarter. This is not anticipated in the further quarters. Both the higher gold and copper CAS of $774 per ounce and $1.98 per pound, respectively, were a function of lower production and higher mill maintenance costs that I just mentioned.","At Batu Hijau, we recently experienced the pit wall failure that limits access to the bottom of the mine. However, Batu is currently in a stripping phase and we are processing stockpiled material, so this does not cause any immediate production impact. As a reminder, since Batu is currently in the stripping phase, it is a very small contributor at less than 1% of our overall gold production outlook for the year. At the Tanami shaft project in Australia, construction of the camp is complete and we're in the process of finalizing vendor selection for the new crusher and we've awarded the underground mine development contract.","Turning to Slide 16, we've summarized first quarter performance at Ahafo in Africa, where production of 175,000 ounces was down about 6% from Q1 2011 due to mine sequencing that I mentioned earlier. CAS was $568, up from a year ago due to lower production and higher direct mining costs, along with an increase in royalties and taxes related to higher gold prices.","Turning to Slide 17, you'll see an image of construction on the ball mill and SAG Mill foundations at the Akyem project in Ghana. Construction is progressing very well. We've recently poured first concrete at the primary crusher, started work on the conveyor quarter, poured the final floor sections of the mine services area workshop and completed the reclaimed tunnel slab core. We received approval to start pit clearing and work on the pit area and pit access roads which began in February. Meanwhile, we are currently advancing some additional projects in Ghana, including expanding the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground expansion, as well as conducting some exploration regarding the mineralization below the planned Akyem pit and in the Ahafo north area.","I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard.","Richard T. O'Brien","Thanks, Gary, and thanks, Russell. I'll wrap up by reiterating that execution has been and will continue to be job #1 at Newmont. And what do we mean by execution? We mean delivering safely on our goals for production, costs and capital. We also mean bringing projects into production effectively and efficiently. We believe firmly that our commitment to execution, paired with an emphasis on capital returns, both of and on capital, sets us apart in the industry, and we absolutely expect this focus to continue. ","Thanks for listening to the call. And operator, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question from John Bridges, JPMorgan.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wondering if you could sort of give us a little bit of guidance as to what sort of the changes in the plan in Peru at Conga could -- how big a change in cost could that have?","Richard T. O'Brien","John, that's precisely what we're evaluating. Just to put it in the context, as we are going through this review, which I expect will take a bit of time, we're evaluating both the technical aspects. And as I said, the first thing to recognize is that the EIA that we did, did meet all the technical requirements for its approval and did conform to both international and Peruvian standards. So we will continue to evaluate the recommendations around things that we should consider. When we evaluate that, we'll look at 2 things, both how it impacts the timing of the Conga project, as well as the cost. So that's something that we're in the process of evaluating. And recognizing that we just received the report last week, we're still in process on that. But I guarantee you, John, when we go through this, when we get to the point where we know what the cost structure would be, we are going to look at the economics of this project, just as we've said, and we feel that we have other options in the portfolio should those economics turn out to not be favorable and that's something that we could not go forward with. That said, that's not where we are today. We continue to evaluate.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And you've got a dividend to maintain as well?","Richard T. O'Brien","We do, and we feel absolutely good about maintaining that dividend with or without Conga.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And further on that, on the cost side, I see you've made a bit of progress there. Any areas that you feel you can focus on to better control costs?","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes, I think as Russell said, we have a number of areas where we are going to focus, and I think it goes right on through, as we look at the opportunities that we have in the world today, I think one of the things you're going to see is us focus more on select opportunities and really continue to build the early stage of the pipeline. But looking at exploration of the advanced projects, we probably will have some opportunities in that as we go forward even this year to reduce capital, yet not impact the plans that we have, and I'd say right on through project construction, where we are going to be looking in particular at our overheads, as well as the project teams that we have in place. And then right on through in the G&A, and when I say G&A, I mean the corporate-wide structure both in Denver and around the world to see where we have duplication. We have been investing, as we have talked about, in new systems. Our SAP rollout will be completed by the end of the year. We will be incorporating savings going forward from that as we look into our 2013 budget process and cycle. And in that plan, I fully expect that we will see costs come down across the company.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just finally, with this change to some of the Canadian reporting companies to IFSR (sic) [IFRS], then they seem to have more flexibility now on how they report costs. Would it be possible to get a bit more information on strip ratio so we can sort of better compare your costs with some of those guys?","Russell D. Ball","John, it's Russ. Yes, clearly, under U.S. GAAP, we have, as you, I think, alluded to, less flexibility around that reporting. We are looking at providing more information around an equivalent to a 43-101. We're working through some of the legal issues related there, too. We will endeavor, and John's group has been working on this to provide more of that color to let you guys do a better job modeling perhaps at our Investor Day on May 23. So you should look for more granularity around the projects on May 23. It probably won't get us all the way to where you'd like to be, but it'll certainly get us further than where we are today.","Operator","Our next question from David Haughton, BMO Capital Markets.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Yanacocha had a pretty good result going through the mill. The milling rate was well above what we thought on the grades. What should we be thinking about that going forward?","Gary J. Goldberg","Yes, David. It's Gary Goldberg here. We had higher grades in particular in the first quarter, and that was expected. Little better results and what might have been modeled at the one pit, but right now, we're still looking at staying within the guidance that we provided.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And the nameplate of the mill was around about 6 million tons per annum, but it seems to be overachieving. Should we -- is that just the softness of the ore at the moment? Or is that, that you've de-bottlenecked it so that we can see sustained good throughput?","Richard T. O'Brien","It's Richard, David. We have had success at that mill from really the day we started it to actually get over nameplate and maintain it there. And I think it's a combination of both the ore quality, but also, we have done a significant study over the last year or 2 on a business excellence study to get more throughput. And that's true of our mills around the world, but this is one where we actually see it in practice every day.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And I guess philosophically from the point of view of Conga, one of the appeals, I guess, of Conga was that it's like a trial mine of potential sulfides below Yanacocha. Where does the Yanacocha sulfides fit in all of this? Is it just still too nebulous for you to be thinking about it?","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes, so let me take that. Actually, what we said about the Conga project was that it was going to help get us more into copper, and it does have the quality of both copper and gold in a larger porphyry. It is a different deposit though than Yanacocha. This is a typical sulfide deposit -- or copper porphyry, rather. And when we're talking about the deposits below Yanacocha, it's significantly different in that it is a deposit which is going to require more technical work for us to assess the commercial practicability of actually producing that. And what I would say is, as we review Conga, we are reviewing all of our investments in Peru, including those potential deposits. So all of that is something that we're looking at, at the moment. And as we get to Investor Day and beyond, we'll keep you informed as to what we think of the prospects of those. So I think it's both timing and, as we've said, technical feasibility for those, so we'll keep you informed.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Switching back to Nevada, most of the work appears to be focused on Long Canyon. Has there been any work undertaken on Sandman or Northumberland that was also picked up with the Fronteer package?","Grigore Simon","Yes, this is Grigore Simon. Most of the focus is correct to \u2013 is at Long Canyon. At Sandman, what we are doing, we are moving the project into the pre-scoping and scoping phase, so we will be spending a bit more time there. As far as Northumberland is concerned, we are evaluating options in terms of further exploration progress, but we really didn't spend a lot of time there last year. And this year, it's a pretty small program overall.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Given the work on Sandman, is it -- is there potential for it to be brought on stream before Long Canyon?","Grigore Simon","Right now, honestly, I don't see how that one would happen because Long Canyon, it's -- looks much more prospective. So we will -- in the portfolio context, we will be pushing Long Canyon faster than Sandman at this stage. But again, it doesn't mean that we are not going to move along Sandman. It's just that it's not going to move at the same pace.","Operator","Our next question from George Topping, Stifel, Nicolaus.","George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Boddington was a little bit worse than we were expecting. And it looks like the grades fell 10% from Q4. Can you talk about where you see grades and production for Boddington through the remainder of the year, please?","Gary J. Goldberg","Yes, we do -- this is Gary again. George, we do see grades down from last year to this year, and that was built into our forecast for the full year production at Boddington. The challenge this past quarter was really mill throughput. We do a combination of some stockpiling there to ensure we get the good grades through the mill. But really, the issue this quarter was around an extended mill shut that went longer by 2 days than what we expected and the conveyor failure that we had with the motors. So don't expect that to continue. And actually, there's been quite an effort going on there, as Richard mentioned, in terms of the mill capacity work that's been done around the group. A lot of work has been done at Boddington to focus on making sure we get that whole mill production process up to speed, and we're really trying to push to make sure we can achieve what we believe is nameplate or maybe a little bit beyond here through the rest of this year.","George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. Are you looking at not having bounced back so far in Q2?","Gary J. Goldberg","I'm sorry, a what spike?","George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Are you looking at Boddington production improving through the month of -- has it improved in April?","Gary J. Goldberg","I'm sorry, yes. We look at Boddington's production without the mill shutdown in place getting back in line with what we'd expect for the full year.","George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right, good. And then another question is on  -- this is more -- this for financial, it's the dividends to noncontrolling shareholders. There's none in the Q1. Is one being made subsequent to the quarter, or was there none required to be paid?","Russell D. Ball","No, George, this is Russ. Yes, those -- that line that you see reflected in the financials is largely the dividend paid out of Batu Hijau. We have not declared one. We generally do it annually and do it towards the end of the year, so you shouldn't expect to see something until probably the fourth quarter.","George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right. This is the noncontrolling interest?","Russell D. Ball","Yes, that's for the, effectively half of that project that we don't own.","George Topping - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right, yes, okay. And then just while we're on Indonesia, if you could fill us in on the -- how the political risk is evolving there. Because I noticed that's one of the areas where you are considering to invest more.","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes, I'll start. It's Richard. So I think the political risk in Indonesia -- we've been operating in Indonesia for quite some time. As you know, we've been going through a divestiture process over the last several years. And as a result of that, we have almost continuous interaction with both the local community, who have an interest in the current shares that have been divested, as well as an interest in the potential shares. The central government, who is the buyer at least at the moment for the 7%, and we hope that, that will close sometime in the next few months. I think as we see that 7% close, I think we will then be through the divestiture issues and then solidly into what does the rest of Indonesia look like. We think Indonesia continues to be prospective within our contracted work. We are continuing to explore it along, which we think has potential to be similar to Batu Hijau in terms of its output, but probably, twice as big and half the grade, so obviously dependent on economics. But we continue to look at that. Why? Because we believe that the political situation in Indonesia continues to support mining. We do have a contract of work, and the government has indicated that they would like to see certain forms or provisions of that change, including the potential for refining more copper product in Indonesia. And what I can tell you is that the one refinery that is available in Indonesia to process is full. So we continue to work with the government on what we're going to do next. If that's really what's going to happen, somebody's going to have to construct a refinery. So what I'd say is the dialogue with Indonesia continues to be a dialogue. But I'd say generally, it's been constructive. We have worked through the issues. We've been there quite some time. I think on the ground, we provide meaningful jobs and meaningful revenue to the government, and we continue to be cited as one of the most environmentally and, I think, financially, in terms of filing our tax returns and paying on time, of any mining company in Peru -- so I think -- or sorry, I meant in Indonesia. But you could also say that in Peru. So we continue to be positive, I think, about Indonesia. No question, we've got to keep an eye on what's happening there, and elections are going to be coming up there in the next couple years as well.","Russell D. Ball","And George, just adding to Richard's comment, the additional investment we've contemplated on and off over the last decade is around a third SAG, so a mill expansion at the existing operation in Indonesia. And then just further on the exploration, we approved yesterday an unbudgeted request for $20 million for helicopter-supported drilling at Elang, which will give you an indication of our perspective on that risk profile.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Richard O'Brien, President and CEO, for closing comments.","Richard T. O'Brien","Thanks, everybody, for taking some time Friday morning to attend our call. And if you have questions, I know John and his team would be more than willing to take them, and we look forward to seeing all of you and even some people who aren't on the call at our Investor Day. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open it up for question-and-answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has objections, please disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Sir, you may begin.","John Seaberg","Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. Welcome to Newmont's second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Today, our speakers are joining us from our office in Elko, Nevada, as our directors and executives have been out visiting our North America operation this week. Our President and CEO, Gary Goldberg and other members of our executive team are on the line and will be available to answer questions at the end of our call.","Turning to slide two. I would like to refer you to our cautionary statement as we will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks, as further described in our SEC filings which could be found on our website at newmont.com.","Now, I will turn the call over to Gary in Nevada.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I will start by discussing our safety performance. Safety is our most important value and I am pleased to report that we have kept our reportable injury rate at or below 0.5 injuries per 200,00 hours work for three quarters in a row. Our goal is to eliminate all workplace injuries and our projects team in Peru is proving this is possible by reaching a new milestone of 40 million hours working safely.","As context, the small mines such as Waihi would have to run for nearly 40 years without a lost time injury to reach this milestone. Unfortunately this performance is overshadowed by the loss of our colleague, Corey Vasquez, in June. Corey was operating an underground loader at our Exodus mine in Nevada preparing a stope for backfilling. This loader traveled over the edge of the stope and Corey did not survive the fall. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and co-workers and a full investigation is underway.","I will walk you through the highlights of our second quarter performance on slide 4. Our operations are performing in line with expectations and our cost improvement efforts are really gaining momentum. Our quarterly revenues were U.S.$2 billion and cash flow from continuing operations was $293 million, or $0.59 per share We reduced spending by $362 million, or 10% compared to the first half of 2012, excluding development capital.","Our capital expenditures were also down $458 million, or 29% compared to the first half of 2012. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we wrote down the value of our assets, stockpiles and ore on leach pads, by $1.8 billion on an attributable basis net of taxes. Tom will walk you through the details later in his presentation. Including these write-downs, our production, CAS, and all-in sustaining costs, remained in line with guidance.","I would like to now take a minute to cover what we are doing to strengthen the business for all cycles and turning it to slide 5. We have been taking action to respond to the volatility we face today. At the same time, we believe that the long-term gold and copper demand outlook remains bright.","Our work to build the more resilient business includes accelerating the pace and magnitude of our cost and efficiency improvements, strengthening our fundamental technical skills from resource modeling through reclamation, optimizing our portfolio, exploration strategy and project pipeline and investing in only our most promising growth opportunities. Finally, preserving financial flexibility.","Let's turn to our production performance for the quarter summarized on slide 6. As we recently announced, second quarter gold and copper production was in line with the prior year and sales were slightly higher. We remain on track to meet full year guidance of 4.8 million to 5.1 million ounces of gold by year end and we expect a stronger second half performance due to improved mill throughput here in Nevada and new production at Akyem in Ghana. Copper production in the second quarter was in line with our plans and we are maintaining our annual outlook of 150 million to 170 million pounds of production.","Let's turn to slide 7 to see the regional details. North America gold production is in line with the second quarter of 2012, and as I mentioned, expected to improve as the year progresses. Gold production at La Herradura in Mexico was down for the quarter due to lower leach recoveries. Mexico production will be lower for the balance of the year, due to a land dispute and we have adjusted our attributable gold production outlook for La Herradura, down 25,000 ounces from original guidance.","Australia and New Zealand delivered higher production compared to the previous year's quarter and compared to plan. This performance was driven by the team at Tanami who delivered higher mill throughput and higher grade to exceed 2012 production levels. I am pleased with the work that Carlos Santa Cruz and his team are doing to improve our operational performance in the region.","As expected, South America production was lower than second quarter due to the ramp down of mining at El Tapado. In Africa, gold production was slightly higher than the prior year on the back of higher mill throughput and recovery. Finally in Indonesia, gold production was negligible as we continue with our Phase 6 drifting which we expect to be into or later in 2014.","Copper production decreased 11% due to lower mill throughput at Boddington and lower throughput in grade at Batu Hijau. These production levels were in line with our plans. Absent the impact of write-downs our all-in sustaining costs remained in line with expectations.","Turning to slide 8. This waterfall chart shows the factors affecting our all-in sustaining costs. We continued to reduce our costs and have lowered our overhead and sustaining capital by about $250 million compared to the second quarter of last year.","I am pleased to report that our all-in sustaining cost are tracking 10% lower than the second quarter of 2012 and in line with guidance for 2013 excluding the write-downs. We have also updated our full-year guidance to adhere to the recently released World Gold Council definition of all-in sustaining cost. The only real change is that we now include reclamation and remediation cost in the metric. We also presented our regional all-in sustaining cost in our 10-Q filing.","Let's turn to the slide nine for more detail on capital spend. So far this year, we have reduced our capital by 29% compared to 2012. Key elements of this include completing the Emigrant project here in Nevada which is now producing about 85,000 ounces of gold per year, reduced spending at Conga with the completion of the Chailhuagon reservoir, our milestone and our water first development approach, we are nearing completion of our team project in Africa with first production expected in Q4 of this year and reducing our sustaining capital spend across the entire business. This is reflected in our lower overall capital spending guidance for 2013.","I would now like to hand over to Tom Mahoney to walk you through our financial performance beginning on slide 10.","Tom Mahoney","Thank you, Gary and good morning. We reported quarterly revenues of $2 billion and operating cash flow of $293 million or $0.59 per share for the quarter. Taking into account the non-cash impairments, this translates to an adjusted net income of $0.45 per share.","Let's turn to slide 11 for more detail on those impairments. Attributable impairments to our long lived assets at Boddington and Tanami totaled approximately $1.5 billion net of tax. We also realized attributable impairments to our stockpiles and ore on leach pads of $272 million also net of tax. The same factors that impacted these operating assets also affected our deferred tax assets. As a result, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $535 million, reflecting uncertainty of our ability to utilize future foreign tax credit.","Now I would like to cover how write-downs impacted our cost applicable to sales and turning to slide 12. Excluding the impact of impairments, CAS was the quarter was $724 per ounce, in line with our original outlook. This number was impacted by higher input cost and inventory change, partially offset by higher sales and lower royalties due to lower gold prices.","Let's turn to slide 13 for the regional impacts. Stockpile write-downs affected South America, Australia, New Zealand and Indonesia. Once again, excluding the impact of these write-downs, we are inline with our original guidance for the year. Higher numbers in Indonesia are related to the lower production levels as we continued Phase 6 stripping at Batu Hijau.","Moving to slide 14. Despite the volatility facing the sector, Newmont retains its financial flexibility. We continue to manage our liquidity position and capital structure to an investment grade profile. Most of new of Newmont's debt is long dated with favorable terms. We currently have approximately $5 billion in available liquidity and investment grade credit rating and ratios that demonstrates the health of our balance sheet. Our focus is on preserving financial flexibility throughout price cycles. Financial strength also allows us to return capital to shareholders.","Turning to slide 15. Our dividend policy increases and decreases as the gold price rises and falls. The second quarter average London PM Fix price of $1,415 per ounce resulted in a $0.25 per share dividend as approved by our Board.","With that I will turn it back to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Tom. Turning to slide 16. Making Newmont a more resilient business has been my top priority since I started as CEO in March. I will take just a minute to walk you through what we are doing to accomplish that.","In July, we realized net total proceeds of CAD 608 million through the sale of our Canadian Oil Sands interest. The transaction represents a net gain of $300 million, which will be recorded in the third quarter. We have also launched an intensive operational improvement program called Full Potential. This program has been deployed at our major sites and is designed to deliver a step change in cost and efficiency improvements. You might recall, I mentioned that at the Q1 earnings call.","Having spent time here in Nevada operations this week, I am pleased to see the enthusiasm and progress that Tom Kerr's team is making. We are also on track to reduce our corporate workforce by more than one-third and we are already addressing a regional overhead cost. Finally, we are taking steps to optimize exploration, procurement and projects. Capital discipline is another aspect of our work to build the more resilient business and I will update you on our major projects on slide 17.","In Nevada, the Turf Vent Shaft project leverages existing infrastructure to increase production. Our Phoenix Copper Leach project will begin production in the fourth quarter this year converting waste to ore and adding incremental copper production. We are progressing Long Canyon through ongoing exploration and expect to declare first reserves with our 2013 results.","In South America, the water first approach at Conga continues and we completed construction of our first reservoir this quarter. The mineral agreement for the Merian project was approved by Suriname's National Assembly in June and we continue to work with the government to progress this project. In Africa, our team is nearing completion and construction remains on schedule and on budget. First production is expected by the end of this year.","I will now turn you to slide 18 to wrap up.","While we cannot control metal prices, we are managing what we can control, I am pleased with our progress toward improving operational cost and efficiencies, raising our technical standards and advancing only our most profitable projects. I also remain committed to preserving the financial flexibility we need to address our challenges and make the most of emerging opportunities.","Newmont's executive team and I will be hosting our Annual Investor Day on August 1st in New York to discuss our strategy, goals and projects in greater detail and I hope that you will join us there next week.","Thanks very much. Operator, please now open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We have a question from John Bridges with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","Thanks for the opportunity. We put a note out on hedging a week or so ago and also the debt right yes, so I thought I would push my luck here. You mentioned that you can't affect the metal prices, but for short period maybe you could. Are you going through a weak spot in second half of this year before you get the bigger revenues coming in from Ghana in 2015 from Batu Hijau. Have you thought about protecting your metal prices just a little bit?","Gary Goldberg","John, thanks for the question. Of course, we discussed that potential, but that is not something we are looking to do. I think we have got strong business fundamentals underlying and sure there is cycles happening in price, but looking to hedge our gold or copper positions is not something we are considering taking on at this time.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","Okay. Bit of an accounting question, the impact of the write-downs on DD&A we should use going forward?","Gary Goldberg","I will ask Tom to provide that. We do have the guidance and we have shown that both, with and without the impact I would refer you to the right page. Page six of the earnings announcement last night has an update on DD&A. Excluding write-downs, we are still looking at [$1.50 million], $1.1 million, including the stockpile write-downs increases that [$1.25] billion, so $1.3 million.","Randy Engel","John. It's Randy. That's on a consolidated basis. You will see the attributable equivalent of that next to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Haughton with BMO. Your line is open.","David Haughton - BMO","Good morning, and thank you for the update. With the impairments taken on the stockpiles, what price is imputed in the current carrying value of these stockpiles?","Tom Mahoney","The carrying value that we are suggesting, first of all, we use the long-term gold price assumption of $1,400 per ounce of gold and $3 per pound of copper. So that filters through in terms of the valuation that we use for the impairment.","David Haughton - BMO","What events would be required for you to revisit those carrying values? Would it be a lower metal price than where we are at today, for instance? Or is there some other trigger that would make you revisit these numbers?","Gary Goldberg","Where we sit today it would primarily be a change in metal prices. If we did have a substantial change on our operating cost then that could also affect our evaluations.","David Haughton - BMO","Okay. Changing now to the operations, which performed pretty well really for the quarter. Just thinking about the development projects. You have got Phoenix coming up with the leach. Do you intend to report that separately, so that we can get an idea as to what the contribution is of the investment there?","Gary Goldberg","David, at this point we would be including that as a byproduct in the region. So it is something we have been discussing in terms of making sure we have got visibility in what the actual production of copper is from the leach as it's a pure copper stream there.","Randy Engel","Yes, David, we will do a trend or we could do something supplemental and try and break that out supplementally.","David Haughton - BMO","Yes. So it looks like a reasonable investment day. So it would be get the visibility that Gary had over '13. Now, switching over to Merian, as I mentioned, we have received parliamentary approval of our mineral agreement. We are now awaiting basically signature for us and the government to sign that agreement.","That then triggers some other government approvals that we would be waiting for. Once we have received those, we would be in a position to assess given where we see the current price is in the marketplace, whether this is a project that we are ultimately going to move forward with now or whether we make a decision to hold.","I think part of it, like people have been, we are waiting to see where near-term prices settle out at before we move forward with the project. So we are continuing at a low level of spend in the region until we can get, really the government approvals and then be in a position to make the final call on economics.","So we are done. The feasibility study is done and that's been submitted to the government for their review and all that work is done.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Chidley with HSBC. Your line is open.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Just in terms of cost reductions that you mentioned. Can you outline maybe what areas are you seeing these costs reductions coming in. I know you have reduced overheads and it seems like a large amount of it is reductions in sustaining capital. So are there any other input costs coming down that you have noticed such as, I don't know, contracts and sign item and that sort of thing?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, I think we are covering really everything in the process here, Patrick. I think I outlined last quarter some of the things that Boddington are looking right through ultimate pits, pit design, changing our strip ratios. We still have the step out capability but shrinking in the medium term the size of the pit which gets back to mining efficiencies.","We are looking at really all the operations in terms of what we might do on an improved recovery. We met with the full potential team here on Wednesday at Carlin and they are looking at ways to improve efficiency and recoveries that Mill 5 and Mill 6. So that's an example where you don't have to do any mining if you get extra recovery that flows right through to production.","In terms of input costs, we are reviewing our supply contracts for cyanide, tires, diesel, all explosives, all the main input costs and going back to our vendors, where we feel that those costs are out of line of what current market conditions are for us. So, really, on top of what you outlined in terms of overhead cost, sustaining capital it's about making sure we are spending the right amount and may be getting a little more out of what capital we do have in place before we replace things, so everything is on the table, Patrick.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","So, in terms of what you are seeing in the market for prices for input. Are you seeing those coming down explosives, cyanide?","Gary Goldberg","I think, we have seen a trajectory in the last couple of years of those going up probably higher than what at least I think they should have been going up that, so we are revisiting all of those to bring those back down in line with what is a more reasonable amount.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Right. Then in terms of the reduction sustaining capital, is that sustainable itself or is it just you are pushing, sort of you are not replacing certain equipments and maybe next year we are just going to see that come back?","Gary Goldberg","It's a good question and it's part of as we go through our planning process looking forward, I want to make sure it isn't just turning into the role in the carpet as I say to folks here every role to carpet of 2014 as it bumps and so it has got to be things and really is putting a priority what's critical, what are things that might have been nice to have that absolutely that we have to take out of the plan going forward.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","You mentioned higher grades at Tanami, and looking at potential mine life of some of the mines, Tanami, Jundee and Yanacocha, what are you thinking about mine lives now and if you get to the end of the year and you having mine at high grades. Are we really at very much shorter mine lives here?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. At this stage, and given current conditions, we haven't really changed significantly the cut off grade parameters, so we are still mining generally to those cut off grade parameters. At Tanami it really was a matter of actually intersecting higher grade ore at the deposit itself at this part of the sequence which was in the plan, so it wasn't a change from the original plan.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Okay. Good, I will hand over to someone else. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Walker RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Stephen Walker - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you very much. Just a question circling back as a follow-up on David's questions on the carrying value of the write-downs for leach and the stockpiles, you booked reserves at $1,400 at year end and I am just curious did you consider adjusting the carrying value of the leach stockpiles at year end. And, was it just a sharp drop in gold price that was a catalyst for this adjustment now?","Gary Goldberg","We reported reserves at $1,400 gold and $325 copper at the end of the year for business planning purposes and we would have listed this in our guidance at the beginning of the year we used $1,500 gold, so at the $1,500 gold price that we ran that through the stockpiles and it didn't have an effect on stockpile valuations or asset valuations.","Stephen Walker - RBC Capital Markets","Again, out of curiosity I didn't go through the Q yet, but what's the carrying value of the leach and the stockpile accumulated now?","Gary Goldberg","As of the end of June, I show that at just under $3.5 billion.","Stephen Walker - RBC Capital Markets","Just as a follow up, if you drop that gold price by $100, $1,300 what sort of delta could we expect on the potential drop in value? If you don't have it at your fingertips that would be an interesting number to know what the $100 change?","Gary Goldberg","I pointed to a place in the Q, page 70. Actually I have got the wrong page. We have to find the page, but it is in the Q. What we did was give a 10% reduction to the $1,400 price and to the $3 gold price. The overall range we gave was $650 million to $700 million in the Q, and that's on a consolidated before tax basis, so it doesn't have that back to an attributable or after-tax basis. When you look at that, the biggest impact that we would see is about two-thirds of that is Batu Hijau.","Stephen Walker - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you for that. Just one last question. At Conga, you finished the one reservoir. I believe there has been some local protests, on and off here, over the summer. Are your plans still to continue with the second reservoir and the capital spending that was laid out at the beginning of the year?","Randy Engel","Thanks, Steven. We have been working with the team and I have to say, here is another area where I am very pleased with the work the team have been doing to get out in the community and to really clarify the work that we have been doing in building Chailhuagon and the progress we have made.","We have had, and you have seen the reports there around concerns and protests around de-watering a lake that's called Perol. What we have done, we have finished the Chailhuagon reservoir and we have now moved to building and completing an access road between Yanacocha and Conga. So we can actually reduce the impact we have on driving through local communities to access the site.","That looks to take through the middle of next year and then beyond that would be the work to construct the Perol reservoir. We are really waiting right now. We don't have the permit to be able to dewater the lake into the new reservoir. So that's one of the key items. Then, of course, we need to continue to work on getting local support.","It is interesting to see that here just a couple of weeks ago, there was a march in support of the project and in support of development in the Cajamarca region that went on. So it's nice to see that people are recognizing the impact that our business has in a positive way on jobs in the region and we still remain sensitive and committed to our water first approach at Conga.","Stephen Walker - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Gary, it's a little early to be thinking about planning for 2014 and gold price assumptions, but in using $1,400 this year, you were slightly below the three year trailing. I am just thinking, what are your thoughts looking out into 2014 with respect to gold price assumptions for reserves and resources? How conservative will you continue to be, I guess? And how you look at with your booking as reserves and resources?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, and you spot on it. It's early to make the commitment on reserves and resources but as we are doing some preliminary work, of course we have looked at a variety of different pricing scenarios to understand the impact on the business, both up and down, to make sure that we are positioning the business properly to work through the cycles.","As we look through 2014, we are in the middle of the planning process with the regions and going through the details. So we have got them still working off the $1,400 price, longer-term price for reserve and resource. You will recall, we had $1,600 as a resource for this year when we reported resource.","For planning purposes in the short term, which is the next three years, we have been using a $1,200 price. Not because we believe that's necessarily the right answer but to make sure we are building some conservatism and the understand the impacts here over the next two to three years what that might look like. So that's one of the things that we are testing with the team in terms of pricing assumptions.","Stephen Walker - RBC Capital Markets","That's very helpful, thank you very much Gary.","Randy Engel","Stephen, it's Randy. Just on your first question, the sensitivity. It's on page 76 of the Q and the number is 10% change in the long-term metal price. It would result in $650 million or $700 million change in the overall write-downs on the leach pads.","Stephen Walker - RBC Capital Markets","The 3.5. Okay, that's helpful.","Randy Engel","Yes, and that's before tax and no interest.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Topping with Stifel. Your line is open.","George Topping - Stifel","Most questions have been answered but I am interested in the lay-offs at Boddington. Will there be a production impact at some of these operations where you are laying people off, maybe lower production at lower cash cost perhaps?","Gary Goldberg","George, a good question in terms of how it effects production. At this stage, we don't see it effecting the production here over the next couple of years. I mentioned some of the redesign we are doing on the mine plans there. So we do look at the long range stripping, what makes sense, but just like the question on sustaining capital, you don't want to put the corporate rollout one year and bend it yourself into a buying, stripping wise. So we need and continue to make sure we are building in the right stripping patterns for the future.","So I think what you saw there is really looking to drive efficiency. We need to make sure we have got the right folks working efficiently at the mining phase, but also to make sure the organization structure is efficient, so some of what you may be seeing there is some of the support people that are there.","George Topping - Stifel","Also, I noticed you did a deal with Veris in Nevada. Is there scope at other operations to look at processing old dumps?","Gary Goldberg","I think, we are always open to look at opportunities and they come and go from time-to-time, but bottom line my view it can become a distraction to the main part of the business that we have and it's got to add value and so it's looking at what the impact is to the business.","George Topping - Stifel","Right. Good. Okay. Thank you.","Gary Goldberg","Welcome George.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.","Your line is open.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, Gary and team. Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. My question is, really, how should we think about how you intend to fund growth CapEx into 2014? If we just kind of take current spot gold prices in your latest 2Q all-in sustaining cost, you seem to be clearing about $200 announce free cash flow, but that's before the payment of dividends and interest expense and taxes which seem to be covered by that amount but you are not able to really effectively fund the growth CapEx. so I just wanted to get an idea of what you are kind of targeting for our growth CapEx number for 2014 or conceptually, how you would be funding it. I did pick up that you sold this oil asset, so that could be a source of funds. Would there be other portfolio [ledgering] that you could see to free up funds to find your next generation growth CapEx?","Tom Mahoney","This is Tom Mahoney. Good morning. When we look at our growth plans and our business plans, we obviously consider all the various sources of capital and we continue to hold on the balance sheet marketable securities.","One of the things that we also consider is the slightly longer outlook in terms of our production profile and business plans. As you would know, we have a team coming on stream in 2014, so that's going to help our production and our cash flows going forward as well as the mining sequence at Batu Hijau. So, again, we take all these into consideration. We feel we are well positioned to fund grow capital and we also would always have excess to debt capital markets given our investment grade rating.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Okay. In terms of the Conga asset as you are still proceeding with this water first strategy, if you get to a point where you decide not to develop that mine, would that be a triggering effect that could lead to further write-downs there, where you have to write-off the value of invested capital to-date?","Tom Mahoney","Jorge, yes, if we decided to discontinue moving forward at the water first, the development of the project that would be a triggering event.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Roughly how much have you spent to-date on Conga and how much is pending?","Tom Mahoney","I believe, where we have the numbers today it's about $1.5 billion year-to-date on a 100% basis, and pending that number and we will have that detail next week, so I am thinking ahead to the slide on that, but we are in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range for that. It might be a little bit more.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Sorry. I just meant the pending on the finishing of the water reservoirs?","Gary Goldberg","Sorry. We will have the details on that next week. We are looking, basically we finished the one. We have about $15 million to spend to complete this access road and then we are looking at about an annual spend of about \u00a0$40 million to $50 million a year to continue to do our ongoing social work, maintain the existing pieces of equipment we have got up in different locations, so we have pulled the spend back quite a bit on that at this point.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anita Soni with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse","Hi. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but could you just talk about the working capital changes this quarter and what those were driving of and then how you see that playing over the next quarter or two?","Gary Goldberg","Okay. I am going to call, we have got Chris Howson, our Controller on the line there in Denver. Chris, can you address that question on working capital changes for the quarter?","Chris Howson","Yes, so we inventory cost into our inventories and then release those in the CAS. Those reflect the direct mining cost and output forecast, and then also release the depreciation of mining equipment into DD&A.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Bridges, JPMorgan. Your may ask your question.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","It's like a round about. Isn't it? Just a couple of loose ends. I was pleased to see you are still spending on the buy leach down there in Peru. Are you getting anything from that or you are still building it?","Gary Goldberg","We were just actually completing construction of the plant. The dumps have actually been placed. So the leach pads, we will test the different size materials that have been placed and we have actually got to bugs cooking, as I like to call it, but the bacteria that's use to breakdown and help release the copper and that's moving along and we have started to circulate solutions. So we should have something more to report here later this year on how that's starting.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","You are not having to giving them oxygen then?","Gary Goldberg","Well they have oxygen but we are not going to do any extra oxygen injection even though they are at altitude.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","Then, as you are in Nevada, any thoughts of cooperation with other parties down there on bringing cost down.","Gary Goldberg","I think that's always something that is out there as a potential but that wasn't the purpose of our visit.","John Bridges - JPMorgan","Okay, well, maybe a next quarter. Thanks a lot guys, good luck.","Operator","We have a question from Paretosh Misra, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Just a question on Indonesia. Any update on the divestiture that was there in Batu Hijau and any update on any discussions you have had with the construction of this smelter? I think some in the government were asking for it.","Gary Goldberg","Good question. In regards to divestiture, we continue to have our 7% stake but we have to worked with the Government of Indonesia to divest. Actually, as of today, that most recent extension would have expired. I got a note this morning as our team is working there.","As you know, they have had some changes in the Ministry of Finance and they are working through and you obviously see a lots of press here and there around it. What we have agreed today is to extend those terms and condition that we agreed now several years ago from an additional six months to see if they can find a path to be able to purchase and acquire that remaining 7%. So that work continues.","With regards to the smelter, we do have several memorandums of understanding with smelting groups or potential smelting groups in Indonesia. We support the concept of being able to process concentrates in country. But at this stage that's not something that we are individually pursuing Newmont in terms of building smelters. That's 's not where our core competencies are. That's not where we would want to invest our money.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Understood, and to the extent you now have any one completed, any recent feasibility study for construct a smelter?","Gary Goldberg","No, I am not across the details of where the different studies are at. So I don't know.","Paretosh Misra - Morgan Stanley","Got it, fair, thanks. One final question, for 2014 CapEx. In the last call, I think Randy was talking about that number falling by about $0.5 billion, any incremental thoughts on that?","Gary Goldberg","No, I think at this stage, and we will going to the plans more in detail here in the coming months and we will give a bit of a flavor next week where that stands. But a lot of that was tied to the completion of construction at the team slowing of work at Conga. So that was the key areas, and we are continuing next year. You will see similar spend I think here in Nevada with the vent shaft is being constructed.","Operator","Your next question comes from Farooq Hamed with Barclays. Your line is open.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","Gary, earlier in the call you mentioned that you are going back to your planning process and you are using $1,200 an ounce for the next few years. I think that's what you said. So can you just help me understand, how do you think about returns in that environment. I mean, when you say you are going to use $1,200, is that using some baked in return or is that kind of breakeven? What's the thinking around that?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. Well, we have our rates of return for projects and hurdle rates are key and those varied by the region. So, from my standpoint, we are still watching what's happening with gold price. Just like you saw with the reserve price I would like to build a little conservative into the planning price assumptions to make sure that we have got some headroom and that we are not having to make big changes in shifts and mine designs and things like that. We are looking to maintain a cash flow positive operations as we go through that.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","Okay, so just thinking that all-in sustaining costs before interest and taxes and these things is around the $1,100. At $1200, we don't see much in the way of cash flow. That's why I was just wondering, if we do see gold price weakness, do you see potential ideas. Maybe the question then is, do you see potential to bring that planning number down to a lower number than $1,200.","Tom Mahoney","Exactly, and that's the whole purpose of things like the Full Potential I talked about, the changes in sustaining capital, the work on exploration that we paired back a bit this year and advance projects. So it's early days and we still are working on the targets but we are looking to more than offset inflation and also look to bring our cost down here as we look at our plans for 2014 through the work I have been describing.","I have got good confidence. I have been pleased with how the teams in all the regions have been taking this up and going after and getting after it. They all see what's happening in the marketplace and are doing some good work to address it.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","Okay. Maybe just a question on your exploration budget. Can you just remind me how much of the exploration spend this year is on greenfield?","Gary Goldberg","About 20% of the total spend that we have shown in there. So we show a range of 250 to 300 on a consolidated basis, roughly 20% or so of that is on greenfield.","Farooq Hamed - Barclays","Okay, and would that be an area that you would consider an area to cut if we do see some more gold price weakness later in the year?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, we have done some trimming and actually Grigore Simon, who is our Head of Exploration, and I have been looking at different alternatives and what we might do to make that spend more efficient, potentially investing with some juniors who actually may be have a need for some support that way but have interesting prospects. So we are re-looking at how we manage that spend and much we spend there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","The Australian dollar has moved fair a bit recently. Can you just tell me, in all this analysis, what you did with the Aussie dollar? Again, I know you did have some hedging, where do we stand on that right now because obviously fair a bit of these effects are in Boddington and Australia. So that's going to have a reasonably big impact.","Gary Goldberg","Good question. As we saw in the quarter, the Aussie came off and we actually saw a period at one point it was below $0.90. For purposes of these valuations we used the number in the $0.93 to $0.94 per U.S. dollar.","Tom Mahoney","Our hedge book goes out five years on that a Australian dollar, roughly we are $0.92 is the rate we have locked in on the hedge book. So again if we look longer-term on the Australian dollar, if you consider may be a $0.95 exchange rate and factor in some of the impacts of the hedge book in the near term, we are landing in that $0.0935 range.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Okay, and would that all be hedging all your cost based on the original plans at all this mines at higher gold price, all those costs are hedged forward. So if you did cut back production, you have got a gain or loss there depending on what happens? Or how much of that is actually covered 100%?","Tom Mahoney","It's a stage to hedging programs. So as we go further out on the business plan with less certainty around the actual notional amount, we might be hedging. It trails off. So, the near term, I would say the one month horizon, for instance, we are hedged say 90% but by the say a period of six months out its significantly less. So maybe 85% and then trails up from there. So we don't see ourselves being in a position of overheads on any dollar at any point.","Operator","We have a question from Adam Graf with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question.","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company","Just a point of clarification. I noticed in the breakout operating data, it you looks like you guys have included a line item for the write-downs for the individual operations in the production costs. I was just a little confused because on the P&L statement write-downs are below the gross margins. So I am little confused on why you guys are including these write-downs in the cost applicable to sale?","Gary Goldberg","Adam, it's a good question. I am going to have Chris Howson because he is the financial expert. My mining engineers review of it, you have got the write-down on the asset which do go as you stay below the line. With regards to the stockpile, those do pass back through our CAS, but I would ask Chris to clarify?","Chris Howson","Yes, that's right. So the stockpiles coming through in those write-downs reflect the direct portion of mining cost and applicable support cost. So those are really just a delayed operating cost that are coming through.","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company","But it certainly don't reflect the cost of the operations in the quarter?","Chris Howson","That's correct, Adam. It doesn't reflect the true cash expenditures during the quarter, during the period.","Adam Graf - Cowen & Company","Yes, okay. That was the clarification and then since you guys are in Nevada, just maybe you guys could give us some color on how much mine life there is left at Midas?","Gary Goldberg","Midas is clearly one of our shorter life assets here. We are looking at probably three to four years based on our current understanding of the reserve and resource and what's the most recent pricing.","Randy Engel","Adam, it's Randy. That will be without any further investment.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Garry Goldberg for our closing comments.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, operator, and thanks everybody for taking the time to join us today. It's interesting times in terms of where prices have gone but I really, really am proud of our team across Newmont and how they have been responding in making sure that we position the business to be resilient for the future. We look forward to spending time with some of you next week to run through more details of the business and what I see as a great outlook for this business going forward.

If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President Investor Relations. ","You may begin.","Meredith Bandy","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining us on the call today are Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer. They and other members of our Executive Team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to Slide 2, please take a moment to review the cautionary statement shown here or you can refer to our SEC filings which can be found on our website newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary, on Slide 3.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Meredith, and thank you for joining us this morning. Newmont made a strong start to 2015 and I appreciate the chance to tell you more about our performance. In a nutshell, we continue to deliver safe and steady production at lower cost. We increased our free cash flow by nearly $400 million compared to the first quarter of 2014.","We advanced projects in Nevada, Surinam and New Zealand and announced plans to build a new mine at Long Canyon and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet as the improved performance allowed us to prepaid debt and fund our best growth prospects.","I will turn to Slide 4 to begin with safety. Safety performance is the best way to gauge the health of the business. A strong safety culture goes hand in hand with efficient operations and an engaged work force. We reduced total injury rates by 9% compared to the prior year quarter and two of our operations Akyem and Waihi have worked with auto reportable injury so far this year.","We also had the lowest total injury rates among ICMM member companies in 2014. While these statistics show that we are heading in the right direction, we are not where we need to be.","In January, a contractor named Brian Holmes suffered a fatal injury during a shaft maintenance work at Leeville in Nevada. Our thoughts are with Brian's family and his colleagues. We'll continue to work in our performance until we can send everyone home safely everyday.","Let's turn to Slide 5 for quarter one highlights. Our strategy has proven successful and we\u2019re continuing to follow through on our commitments. The first part of our strategy is to improve the underlying business. We lowered gold all-in sustaining cost for the third quarter running and by 18% compared to the prior year quarter.","This was the result of sustained cost improvements and higher grades. Favorable oil price and exchange rates and some delayed capital that will spend later this year. We also kept gold productions steady quarter-on-quarter offsetting divestments.","The second part of our strategy is to build the stronger portfolio. We reached commercial production at Correnso in January on-time and on-budget and we remain on schedule to deliver first production at our Turf Vent Shaft in late 2015, at Merian in late 2015 and at our newest project Long Canyon in 2017.","The third part of our strategy is to create shareholder value. We generated 815 million and adjusted EBITDA a 65% increase compared to the first quarter of 2014 and prepaid $200 million in debt. We ended the quarter with nearly $2.6 billion in cash on our balance sheet and a net debt that is $1.4 billion lower than a year ago.","Turning to Slide 6. We produced more than 1.2 million ounces of gold and 37,000 tons of copper in the first quarter of 2015. As I mentioned, this more than offset the impact of divesting Midas, Jundee and La Herradura.","Performance was strong across the portfolio. Batu Hijau ended the quarter ahead of schedule as we mined higher grade Phase 6 ore. Twin Creeks' production was favorable due to higher autoclave recovery.","Also note that consistent with prior years, mill 6 at Carlin will be down in the second quarter for planned maintenance. Akyem and Ahafo exceeded targets despite periodic shutdowns due to power availability which I'll cover in a moment.","Boddington also made up for power interruptions resulting from wild fires in Western Australia. Finally, Waihi benefited from higher mill throughput and new production at Correnso.","Our cost performance is also strong. Turning to Slide 7, we reduced gold all-in sustaining cost to $849 per ounce and kept them below $1000 at every one of our managed operations.","I'll turn to Slide 8 to walk through the contribute factors. Our gold all-in sustaining cost improved by $185 per ounce from the prior year quarter. As you can see about half of this improvements stem from CAS reductions driven by better grades and recoveries, as well as sustained cost and efficiency improvements.","For example, at Batu Hijau we reached high grade Phase 6 ore. At Twin Creeks we had improved grades throughput and recoveries. At Yanacocha higher grades and recoveries offset lower throughput and at Tanami improved mining rates led to higher throughput.","Lower oil prices and a favorable Australian dollar exchange rate accounted for another 30% of our AISC improvements. Finally, 15% resulted from lower sustaining capital and advanced projects spend primarily due to timing.","Turning to Slide 9. Before I hand it over to Laurie for financial results, I'll cover a few key opportunities and challenges. Later in the presentation, I will discuss Long Canyon, where we're taking advantage of 50 years of operating in Nevada and the expertise infrastructure and relationships that we have developed along the way to maximize value.","Moving south to Merian, I'm pleased to report that construction is progressing on time and on budget. We have a good partner in the Surinamese government who is current on all cash calls and a highly energized team who has begun pre-production mining.","In Indonesia, we received a new export permit and are having regular meetings with the new administration on the contracted work. Our teams in both Indonesia and Ghana are working to negotiate new labor contracts that continue to offer fair wages and benefits while supporting our ability to thrive and grow.","Negotiations have been more challenging in Ghana but the National Labor Counsel has stepped into the process and we hope to reach an equitable agreement soon.","The other challenge we face in Ghana has to do with power. Drought conditions, fuel supply shortages and diminished plant capacity are impacting Ghana's ability to generate power.","In January the government imposed a 33% load shedding requirement on all industrial customers. We are in discussions with the government and other producers to explore power conservation alternatives to minimize disruptions. We have also implemented contingency plans to add temporary power generation capacity by July and permanent capacity by year end. As I mentioned, Ahafo and Akyem are meeting production and cost targets this year.","With that, I'll turn it to Laurie.","Laurie Brlas","Thanks, Gary, and thanks everyone for joining us today. It was a strong first quarter for Newmont and I'm pleased with our performance. First turning to Slide 11, as Gary mentioned, we continue to see strong cost performance across the portfolio.","Our first quarter cost applicable to sales per ounce and all all-in sustaining costs per ounce were both nearly 20% favorable to the prior year. These improvements drove free cash flow expansion as seen on Slide 12.","We delivered $344 million in consolidated free cash flow in the first quarter and generated a $445 million improvement in cash from continuing operation compared to the year ago quarter, as cost savings more than offset the 7% drop in a gold price.","Also included in our free cash flow was a tax refund of about $100 million received during the quarter. We've reported adjusted net income of $229 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share compared to $121 million or $0.24 per share last year.","Adjusted EBITDA was up 65% from the prior year quarter benefiting from lower cost applicable to sales due to lower direct operating cost, lower fuel prices, a favorable Australian dollar, U.S. dollar exchange rate and lower exploration advanced projects and other expenses.","We continue to fund dividends from free cash flow, and early this week our Board approved a quarterly dividend of 0.025 per share in line with our gold-linked dividend policy.","Turning to Slide 13, we'll walk through the Q1 net income adjustments. The largest adjustments to our GAAP net income during the first quarter included a $0.06 per share gain related to asset sales, $0.07 per share related primarily to impairments of our marketable securities, and a $0.09 per share adjustment related to tax valuation allowances that's coming from foreign tax credit. After reconciling for these items we reported adjusted net income of $229 million or $0.46 per share for the most recent quarter.","And now turning to Slide 14, in today's metal price environment we continue to enhance our financial flexibility. At the end of the first quarter our investment grade balance sheet had approximately $2.6 billion in cash and equivalent, a $3 billion revolver and roughly $200 million in marketable securities. On a consolidated basis that's nearly $6 billion of liquidity.","During the quarter we elected to prepay $200 million towards our existing term loans that matures in 2019. With this most recent prepayment we have delevered our balance sheet by roughly $300 million since last November.","Slide 15 illustrates our scheduled debt maturities. As you can see we do not have any significant debt due until 2019. We maintain an investment grade rating in metrics and our net debt at quarter end was approximately $3.9 billion, and improvement of $1.4 billion compared to the prior year.","During the first quarter, we also extended our revolver. It now runs through 20\/20 giving us significant flexibility. Our revolver has a single financial covenant, maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5% and we stood at 22.7% as of March 31st.","We will continue to analyze opportunities to pay our liabilities in advance. We are on track to pay down $750 million of debt by year end as always any payment of debt will be analyzed in the context of our cash position, operating performance and business environment.","And now turning to Slide 16, our work to delever the balance sheet and improve our underlying business separates Newmont from the competition. As this Slide indicates, our net debt to EBITDA has improved steadily over the last year and outperforms our competitors. Looking forward, we expect this ratio to improve even further.","To summarize, we're comfortable with the relative level of our debt and our maturity profile, but we continue to look at ways to reduce the absolute debt level and safeguards the long term viability of the business.","And now, I'll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Laurie. I'll shift gears now to cover outlook. Turning to Slide 18, we're maintaining our long term guidance which calls for gold production increase from between 4.6 million and 4.9 million ounces in 2015 to between 4.7 million and 5.1 ounces by 2017.","In North American we expect gold production to increase over the three-year period as we complete the Turf Vent Shaft and enter a period of lower striping at Carlin. Long Canyon Phase 1 represents additional upside in 2017 that is not included in this guidance.","We're managing our Austria, New Zealand and Indonesian asset as a single Asia Pacific region in 2015. At Batu Hijau we forecast steady gold and copper production increases through higher grade Phase 6 ore, and higher gold grades and productivity at Tanami.","In Africa, we expect production to decline primarily lower grade ore at Ahafo and we're accessing and we're accessing Ahafo Mill expansion to help offset that trend.","In South America, production is forecasted to decline in 2015 and 2016 before rising in 2017, as the impact of maturing operations at Yanacocha. We're also working on an integrated approach to developing oxide and sulfide deposits that could extend profitable production at Yanacocha. Our guidance also calls for continuous costs improvement.","Turning to Slide 19, we remain on track to meet our near term outlook for gold and copper costs and to keep gold all-in sustaining cost below $1,000 per ounce at our managed operations.","Our global outlook remains the same, but we've made some changes at the regional level, specifically we are lowering our 2015 outlook for the Asia Pacific region by about 3% and keeping with favorable oil prices and exchange rates.","This is offset by a slight cost increase in Africa as we address the power shortages. Our cost could further benefit from favorable energy prices and foreign exchange rates. Our current outlook assumes the Australian dollar at $0.85 for the U.S. dollar and oil at $75 per barrel.","Every $10 reduction in oil price implies a $30 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. Similarly, every $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar exchange rate results in a $60 million improvement in annual attributable free cash flow. These estimates exclude current hedge programs.","Taking a thoughtful approach to managing sustaining capital, turning to Slide 20, we're maintaining our long term outlook for sustaining capital cost between $850 million and $950 million per year.","Our updated 2015 outlook now includes increases to develop Long Canyon and to secure additional power generation in Ghana. We expect to spend about half of our Long Canyon capital estimated between $250 million and $300 million in 2015 and most of the remainder in 2016. We'll keep you posted on any changes as we reach decisions on other new projects.","Turning to Slide 21, we create value by discovering, developing and operating profitable gold mines, and we've improved our ability to do that optimizing our project pipeline and bringing our best projects forward in a measured and sequenced way.","I'll highlight a few of our projects. We're completing the liner for Turf Vent Shaft and have begun install surface facilities. This keeps us on track to reach commercial production later this year.","We're progressing construction of Merian on time and on budget. Detailed engineering is about 75% complete and our project workforce numbers nearly 1200 people. We expect to produce between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of between $650 and $750 per ounce for the first five years beginning in late 2016.","In Australia, we expect to reach an investment decision on our Tanami Expansion project later this year. The project involves building a second decline in the underground mine and incremental capacity in the plant to increase profitable production and extend mine life.","The Tanami Expansion could add incremental gold production of 100,000 to 125,000 ounces per year at lower overall cost for the first five years. If approved we would expect to realized full production and cost improvements in 2017.","In Ghana, we're evaluating an expansion of our existing Ahafo Mill to offset the impact of lower grade ore. We expect to reach a decision latter this year and see the potentials to add 100,000 to 125,000 ounces of productions at competitive cost in 2017.","Our newest project to meet our investment criteria is Long Canyon. Turning to Slide 22, Long Canyon represents a new and highly perspective oxide gold district in Nevada. We are approaching development as an extension of our existing operations.","Taking a phased approach to developing Long Canyon gave us the means to lower development capital to between $250 million and $300 million which generates an internal rate of return of about 17% at current gold prices.","Project highlights include gold reserve of 1.2 million ounces at an average grade of 2.29 grams per ton. This grade compares favorable to the average of 0.7 grams per ton for similar projects in North American.","Annual gold production of between 100,000 and 150,000 ounces over an eight-year mine life beginning in early 2017, and cost applicable to sales are between $400 and $500 per ounce, and all-in sustaining cost of between $500 and $600 per ounce over the life of mine, which is in the lowest cost quartile for gold production.","Looking further up the pipeline at our exploration prospects on Slide 23, exploration is the core competency and forms a critical part of our strategy to lead the gold sector and value creation.","Our program focuses on increasing our existing resource base while maintaining the ability to pursue significant new discoveries. Long Canyon is a great example. We currently have four drill rigs operating onsite, two for in-fill drilling and two for exploration, to assess our best mining and processing options and inform our approach to the next phase of development. To-date only oxide mineralization has been identified over a three mile strike length that remains open in all directions.","Oxide ores [ph] are of course synonymous with lower processing cost. It will be another three to five years before we are ready to make a funding decision on this next phase and we'll keep you posted on our progress.","Other exploration projects that hold the potential to add production in the medium horizon include the Subika underground in Ghana which would give us access to ore grades that are significantly higher than the surface.","Northwest Exodus in Nevada and extension of the Exodus underground mine which would add profitable production and Kacher Maine which is part of the oxide expansion effort at the Yanacocha.","I'll wrap up our comments with the look at where we're taking Newmont into the future. Turning to Slide 24, we're off to a strong start in 2015 and with every quarter we are moving closer to our goal to lead the goal sector in value creation.","Looking forward, we will continue to execute our strategy to improve our underlying business by continuously raising our safety cost and technical performance. To strengthen our portfolio by building a longer life, lower cost asset base and to create shareholder value by generating cash and continuing to strengthen our investment grade balance sheet.","Thank you for your time. I'll now open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Quail from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Andrew Quail","Good morning, Gary, Laurie and team. Congratulations on a very, very strong quarter. A couple of questions from me. First, at Batu, excellent quarter. Obviously, we're going through the phase 6 ore, as you suggested, Gary. When we look at throughput and grade, is this like the benchmark this quarter, or do you expect further improvements from here going forward into 2015?","Gary Goldberg","At this point I'd expect us to see some improvement later in the year, most likely in the third quarter, Andrew, but we're really as you saw on the first quarter we just got into it, it will pick up in the third quarter and then be steady going forward.","Andrew Quail","Great. And one on Merian. Obviously, you received some money from the Suriname government. When do you expect to receive the balance of that?","Gary Goldberg","We received all of the moneys for the initial acquisition of their 25% interest, basically the end of last year, and we made cash calls on a regular basis and that continues. Basically based on what our spent is each month. They make their proportion of the cash calls along the way, so basically they're right up to speed as we go forward.","Andrew Quail","Great. And maybe last one, more on strategies, with Turquoise Ridge, you guys obviously earn 24%. What you see for Newmont going forward? Do you guys have a strategy to maximize that investment?","Gary Goldberg","Yes I think from our standpoint we'll continue to work with our joint venture partner to see how we can best achieve the best value overall for the parties out of that investment. We currently have an agreement to process the ore from the mine at our Twin Creeks facility and we're looking at how we can make sure that we get the best mix going forward between both operations and value for both parties.","Andrew Quail","Thanks very much Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Bridges of JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.","John Bridges","Congratulations, Gary, Laurie, on the results. Just to dig a bit deeper into Batu Hijau. The last time you were in the good stuff there, you had issues with access because of rain, the pulling at the bottom of the pit. How can we model access to this high-grade material over the next two, three years? Are there going to be periods in the monsoon when you're not going to be able to access that and you're going to use stockpile material?","Gary Goldberg","As we put together our plans here as we're into the higher-grade material over the next three years we've taken into account periods when we may not have access and I say, may, because for instance this year we're about 150 feet lower in terms of the water level than what we expected, because we had lower rainfall and we've installed some additional pumping capacity to help us along the way.","So, next year we would have a period, and as we get into the next year we'd give more detail as to when specifically you could expect it, but we'd have a bit of a period in 2016 and then a little bit in 2017. Just fall, when we'd expect to be working in higher areas of the pit.","John Bridges","Okay. So we can expect, this sort of grade or better each quarter of this year?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. This year we're basically through the rainy season that starts later this year and we're in good shape for this year.","John Bridges","Okay. Well done. On Yanacocha you mentioned initiatives down there, could you elaborate a little bit on that? Thank you.","Gary Goldberg","Sure. We're looking, I guess, the word would be holistically at a number of different projects that include potentially the bioleach where we continue to go through testing for at least another year or so to confirm the economics and the value of that portion.","The other elements are how we can carry forward primarily the Verde deposit but there is other deposits there that contain gold and copper and either producing a copper-gold concentrate and selling that or potentially further processing that on site whether it\u2019s through an autoclave or some other concentrate leach process.","We\u2019re looking at basically all these options to extend both oxide and sulfide life at Yanacocha and look to be in a position, I\u2019d say later next year to make a decision on which path or paths make the most sense to develop.","John Bridges","There seems to been better performance from some of these leach process that is down in sea level compared to high altitude. Have you tried out some of these things or altitudes?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. That\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re taking into account as we look at it. Whether we would want to locate those facilities somewhere else or do it at altitude.","John Bridges","Okay. Good luck with that and congratulations again. Thanks Gary and Laurie.","Gary Goldberg","Great. Thanks John.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian MacArthur of UBS. Sir, your line is open.","Brian MacArthur","Good morning. I just want to go back to Batu Hijau to just given the timing of shift of Freeport ramping up at Gresik but now you\u2019re obviously in the high grade ore over the next three years. Do you see any challenge of it being able to place that concentrate from Batu Hijau because obviously they were pushed back from originally picking in 16 and 17.","I just want to make sure you don\u2019t see any problem placing all that concentrates so then it gets taxed at a higher rate outside of not going to Gresik.","Gary Goldberg","Well. It\u2019s actually a smaller percentage Brian of our concentrate that does goes through Gresik, we try to put as much as we can but the rest goes to export and with that we have no problem placing that concentrate.","I think working through we\u2019ve got the extension on our export permit which allows us to you need to export through the basically towards the end of September and we\u2019re working actively now with the government to pin down the changes on the contract of work get those agreed so that we can get into a process and of more certainty in terms of what goes on when each of these six month extensions come up.","Laurie Brlas","The cost of the export duty is built into the guidance that we have given as well.","Brian MacArthur","Okay. That was my next question. Just roughly like how much goes to Gresik is obviously it makes up huge difference going forward as we get into this high grade, is it like 10% or 20% of it that goes there roughly just for my modeling purposes?","Gary Goldberg","Yes I\u2019m going to have to follow up to give you an accurate answer on that one. I just don\u2019t recall it. It\u2019s been a little higher this year than what we anticipated for reasons you\u2019ve seen in terms of other supplying to Gresik and we help to fill in this lack.","Brian MacArthur","Right. Okay but if that happens that is just kind of option value upside rates to go through \u2013 they only pay the export tax.","Gary Goldberg","That\u2019s correct.","Brian MacArthur","And just on Turquoise Ridge, can I just confirm and I can\u2019t remember I should know but just your deal to process Turquoise Ridge at Twin Creeks. Is that like for the current size mine that is to say if that were expanded substantially. Do you still have that right it all has to be work through there? How that actually work?","Gary Goldberg","Basically we\u2019ve got an agreement that runs through 2018 to process the ore and we\u2019re working with them in terms of how we\u2019re looking at potential expansions at Turquoise Ridge to increase their throughput how we would process it. But we clearly have the processing capacity at Twin Creeks to be able to handle some additions.","Brian MacArthur","Great. Thanks very much, Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Yu from Citi. Sir, your line is open.","Brian Yu","Great thanks. Hey Gary, Laurie. Question is just on Ghana and then the permanent power that you\u2019re going to install there, when it\u2019s fully running how much of the power are you going to source captively versus from the grid. Is there going to be a meaningful change in your power cost?","Gary Goldberg","I\u2019m going to have Chris Robison, our Chief Operating Officer to cover up some of the details around the power capacity.","Chris Robison","Yes right now the plan as Gary mentioned earlier is by mid-year we will have temporary power in place which will provide \u2013 which will fill this gap for the 33% load shedding and then by year end, we will have permanent capabilities in place to offset the 33%. ","Obviously if power generation in country increases or starts returning to normal levels then we would back off on our generation. So cost impact is about $10 million or $11 million a year and additional cost with our own generation.","Brian Yu","Okay, so you\u2019re going to have the spare capacity in case you still get this 30% load, but then it is higher cost. So \u2013 to pull more from the grid, you will do that in just.","Gary Goldberg","Absolutely yes.","Brian Yu","Okay. And then so is this \u2013 how should we think about this load shedding. Do you see this one-off type event. Or is it going to impact your decision on somehow with the Ahafo mill expansion?","Gary Goldberg","It\u2019s a good question Brian. As we look at both the Ahafo mill expansion and the Subika underground, we\u2019ve got to assess the power availability, question it\u2019s an issue that needs a longer term solution, we\u2019re working with the government and we\u2019re looking at different options because ultimately it needs more reliable capacity.","Clearly it\u2019s a drought that has affected some of the availability. So getting back to normal conditions will help there, but that takes \u2013 that won\u2019t happen in a period of month, that could take through next year to see that sort of a change. ","We will take that into account as we look at the economics of these expansions and that will be an element that will have to make sure we address as we bring those forward for approval.","Brian Yu","Okay. All right, thank you.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Brian.","Operator","Thank you very much. And our next question comes from the line of Ms. Tanya Jakusconek from Scotiabank. Ma\u2019am, your line is open.","Tanya Jakusconek","Great, thank you. Good morning everyone and congratulations on a good quarter. Just wanted to come back to two operations, Yanacocha and Ahafo. Maybe Gary, can you talk a little bit about what you see happening at Yanacocha in the next couple of years? ","I think you mentioned that you definitely see production declining and if we don't go ahead with some of those options that you talked about, when do we start getting into the stockpile? That's my first question.","Gary Goldberg","Yanacocha and thanks Tanya for the question. Right now under current production we're kind of this is the last peak year in roughly million ounce per year. Next year not quite half it's about 600,000 consolidate ounces. ","We maintain that for the next 2 to 3 years after and then 2019 were down into basically going through the leach pads and what's remaining if we are to do nothing else. So that's the current basically base case scenario.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And then I guess [Kinshasa] [ph] we just seem to forget about that for now?","Gary Goldberg","Kinshasa is still a resource that\u2019s there, but as we continue to do with Conga and continue to work in that whole region to improve our social acceptance that is clearly one that didn\u2019t have the social acceptance and we took a step back there and would require those changes as well before we consider it.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay, and may be moving to Ahafo. I mean you had a very strong Q1 and even if you look at the upper end of your guidance for operations you\u2019re really looking at production fall into may be 77,000 ounces of quarter. ","Is this all going to be grade related or is there something else in the mind plan may be you\u2019re just being conservative, I don\u2019t know may be just talk about how you see the operation through the year?","Gary Goldberg","Basically in, I can have Chris chime in here as well. But we do see the grades declining through the course of the year. And so that's what we've laid out in terms of our guidance at this stage. ","And that's why we're looking at these expansion projects of the Ahafo mill and the Subika underground to be able to help offset the lower grade going forward. Chris we got it covered.","Tanya Jakusconek","Yes I just wanted to make sure that the great decline started in sort of Q2 or do you see yourself being a little bit and then sort of tapering off towards the end of the year, I don\u2019t know.","Gary Goldberg","I think specifics we would see, we are starting to get into some of that lower grade. I think the other piece is just whether anything changes around the power situation. Right now, we\u2019re still running the basically six days on, two days off sort of a process and working through that.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And then just my last question is really on M&A and I think we went through your balance sheets getting stronger and stronger. You got a lot of liquidity available may be you could touch a little bit on your M&A strategy. You have a lot of internal growth that you can push forward, but how do you balance that versus externally?","Gary Goldberg","I think clearly we've got as you acknowledged a very good internal pipeline. We've got the best understanding of those deposits and their potential and we're able to time how we bring those forward in an effective way.","You\u2019ve seen how we\u2019ve handled the cash by paying down debt and also looking to carry forward the best projects. M&A and how it fits, we kick the tires on things and look them over and if we see an opportunity that would add value to our shareholders, we will pursue that.","Tanya Jakusconek","Is the focus more on early stage development or are you looking at producing assets?","Gary Goldberg","At this stage, I really tend to focus more on producing or close to producing types of assets.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay.","Gary Goldberg","I should say gold assets.","Tanya Jakusconek","Yes, okay thank you. It\u2019s just easy to mix with gold and our copper focus. Our gold copper would that still be a focus?","Gary Goldberg","Gold primarily copper gold or gold copper would still fit within there.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. And maybe the potential to pay down $750 million in additional debt this year. What minimum cash balance would you keep on the balance sheet for you to be able to do that?","Gary Goldberg","I\u2019m going to have Laurie pick that one up.","Laurie Brlas","Sure. I think clearly we would get down below $2 billion maybe a $1.5 billion to $2 billion we would try to keep on the balance sheet to make sure that we have coverage and we aren't bringing things back to we don't need to.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. So if we were to just think about it conceptually whatever the gold price will be you know if there aren\u2019t any opportunities for M&A or other investment we can just keep paying off that $219 debt, but keep the cash balance of $1.5 billion to $2 billion would that be fair?","Laurie Brlas","Yes. That would be fair and we will also be paying down. We have some project levels that in Indonesia and that's also targeted for this year, we would hope to pay some of that down as well.","And as Gary mentioned with certain projects in places like Peru and Ghana, we would probably rather leave the cash there and redeploy it on projects if we see that in the near term basis rather than bringing it back and paying down debt.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay. But of the $750 million potential repayment would the majority of that be what was due in 2019?","Laurie Brlas","Most of it will be the term loan yes.","Tanya Jakusconek","Okay, perfect. Well thank you very much and congratulations.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks Tanya.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain and he is from Deutsche Bank. Sir your line is open.","Jorge Beristain","Hi, good morning, Gary and everybody. And again congratulations on the strong results and I think we're really seeing a differentiated performance in your stock vis-\u00e0-vis your peers in the last two years which reflects that.","My question is really on the guidance. So it seems that your cash cost guidance is still maintained in the 660 to 710 range for full year 2015. You printed 609 in Q1 obviously there's some great issues going forward, but it seems you're being fairly conservative there. So could you just talk about around those numbers and why we\u2019re seeing such a sort of implied steep ramp in the rest of year or is it simply conservatism?","Gary Goldberg","Thanks. Thanks first of all for your comments, Jorge very much appreciate the recognition. On guidance, what we've done we've stuck basically with where we were in the original guidance for the year here at Q1 and given - you see the portion of that that comes from the oil and FX, so you can make those adjustments.","I wanted to emphasize that we will be making the spend on the capital, so people don't start modeling a lower amount there. Think in terms of the overall performance what we'll do at the mid-year is take a step back and just make sure it's fully reflective of what we've experienced through the first half of the year.","So we just figured rather than trying to make a big adjustment on the cost numbers we're comfortable with where productions coming in. Let's adjust that. We've made a little tweaks in Africa to account for the power and the tweaks in Australia for what we've seen on changes in oil and exchange rate but we look as we give the second quarter results to update the rest of our guidance.","Laurie Brlas","As Gary pointed out, the oil and FX that we experienced year-to-date we haven't brought those down to the level that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date. So that's definitely something that you could model into your numbers and get to a lower number than what we are currently sitting at.","Jorge Beristain","Right. But that does seem to be roughly 100 million-ish if one was to mark-to-market on an annualized EBITDA basis so didn't see that material, but where it's lacking. My other question was also just on the moving forward on Indonesia and we heard some comments from Freeport yesterday on their call that the amount of equity investment in a smelter would be really paired back in and also very much back end loaded to the second half of this decade.","Could you comment as to where you stand now having had your export license renewed in terms of actually being an equity investor in a potential smelter out there, because it does seem to be a fairly diminimus amount of potential equity and if you\u2019re involved in talks with Freeport to contribute capital they have mentioned many partners are talking with them and if you could just comment on that?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, would probably be considered one of those many partners with the different view, because we bring concentrate into the mix. Our position has been we don\u2019t stand in a good position to build the smelter. We support the country's policy on in country smelting, we work with Freeport or others, because we\u2019re talking with the few other parties that are looking to build the smelter.","When you look at our production profile, you see over the next three years there's a peak and then we go through a low range before we would get into phase 7 out in the 2022, 2023 timeframe and that\u2019s when having a smelter would be of more impact to us since we go through the phase 7 or so.","We\u2019ll continue to keep people updated as we work through those various discussions and also work through with the government I\u2019ve had - I should comment I was out in Indonesia last month and had a number of meetings with different government officials and I was pleased for meeting with government officials in any country.","When you have meetings that start on time and I think what I heard there and what I saw demonstrated in the extension of our export permit what people say they do commit to and it\u2019s good to see.","They\u2019d like to see things wrapped up on this soon so would we, but there\u2019s complexities to work through that we\u2019ve got to get completed.","Jorge Beristain","Great. Thank you.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you, Jorge.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call over back to your host. You may proceed.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you. Thanks again for joining our first quarter earnings call. Our team continues to drive stronger performance across the portfolio sustaining the cost improvements we\u2019ve achieved over the last year progressing new ways to work more efficiently and generating nearly $400 million in free cash flows.","This performance has given us the financial flexibility we need to pay down debt, expand our existing operations, open perspective new districts, and create value for our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll close the call and wish everyone a good weekend. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"15419":["Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 31, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Meredith Bandy - VP, IR","Gary Goldberg - President and CEO","Laurie Brlas - CFO","Analysts","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Newmont Mining Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Meredith Bandy","Thank you, operator, and good morning everyone. Welcome to Newmont's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us in the room today are Gary Goldberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Brlas, Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our executive team will be available to answer questions at the end of the call.","Turning to Slide 2, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement. We'll be discussing forward-looking information, which is subject to a number of risks. More information is included in our SEC filings, which can be found on our Web site at newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you, Meredith, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to share the latest from Newmont. We delivered strong results in the third quarter, including net income of $210 million or $0.42 per share, operating cash flow of $328 million, and stable gold production.","For 2014, we expect our cost to be at the lower end of guidance, and we remain on track to meet our current outlook for production.","Strong performance starts with safe and efficient operations. Turning to Slide 4; over the past two years we've reduced our total injury rates by more than 35%. Our ultimate goal is to prevent all injuries and illnesses at Newmont, and to make the communities where we operate safer too.","For example, we continue to support the fight against Ebola in Western Africa. We're partnering with a private sector group and Project C.U.R.E. to get supplies to frontline medical workers. We're also working with government and health providers in Ghana to raise awareness and preparedness.","While only a few countries are affected, we see this as a global issue, and I'm proud that our employees in Denver have donated to the Red Cross to help putting into this pandemic. We're supporting their efforts by double matching their contributions. I'm also proud of our teams' performance in delivering on our commitments.","Let me turn you to Slide 5; highlights for the quarter fall into three main areas. The first is improving our underlying business. We continue to find ways to operate more efficiently, and that's helped us drive our all-in sustaining costs below $1000 per ounce this quarter.","I'm also pleased to report that Batu Hijau's mine and mill are running at full capacity. We've exported about 75,000 tons of copper concentrates since receiving an export permit in the latter part of September.","Second, we're building a stronger asset portfolio. We received our Right of Exploitation from Merian in late August, and construction mobilization is underway. I got a firsthand look at the Turf Vent Shaft last month, and that project is proceeding safely, on-time, and on-budget.","We also announced the sale of our stake in La Herradura, bringing our total proceeds from asset sales to about $1.3 billion since mid-2013.","Third, we're ultimately here to create value for our shareholders. During the third quarter, we generated $51 million in free cash flow, and reduced our capital expenditures by 30% over the prior year quarter.","Let's turn to Slide 6 for production results. We remain on track to meet production guidance for 2014. Third quarter production is down 10% versus the prior year quarter, but if we adjust for the sale of Midas and Jundee, that number drops to 4%. I'll take a minute to walk you through each region now.","In North America, production was down from the prior year quarter due to planned stripping campaigns at Carlin and Twin Creeks, and the sale of Midas. South America production was also slightly lower than prior year quarter, due to planned processing of lower grade stockpiled ore. We've seen sequential improvements since the second quarter, and we expect production to continue to increase in the fourth quarter as we reach higher grades.","In Australia and New Zealand, production was about 20% below the prior year quarter, in line with plans to [mine] (ph) lower grade ore at Boddington and Tanami, as well as the sale of Jundee. Here too we expect stronger fourth quarter production","As I mentioned earlier, Batu Hijau is now operating at full capacity. We anticipate producing between 25,000 and 35,000 ounces of gold in 2014, and we remain on track to reach higher grade Phase 6 ore in the first half of 2015.","Finally, in Africa, gold production increased 48% over the prior year quarter with continued steady production at Akyem, our lowest cost operation. We recently achieved the milestone of a half a million ounces of gold produced at Akyem since its commissioning last year.","Let's turn to Slide 7, and take a closer look at costs. Our year-to-date cash all-in sustaining cost savings totaled $630 million. This brings us to a total of $1.6 billion in cost reductions since the beginning of 2013. Savings in gold all-in sustaining cost for the quarter were offset by higher copper all-in sustaining cost due to the shutdown in Indonesia earlier this year.","We've also made adjustments to reflect the sale of Midas and Jundee. These savings are the result of making many improvements across the business. Examples include extending asset life from tires to mill liners, optimizing payloads and throughput, and streamlining our overhead costs.","We reduced gold all-in sustaining cost to $995 dollars per ounce, down from $1018 per ounce in the prior year quarter. Our target is to have all-in sustaining costs at or below $1000 per ounce at all of our operations.","Now, I'll hand it over to Laurie to review our third quarter financial results.","Laurie Brlas","Thanks, Gary, and thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning. As Gary described, our results indicate that our focus on cost and portfolio optimization has resulted in strong financial performance for the quarter. With our Q3 results, we reduced costs, delivered positive free cash flow, and improved our guidance.","Turning to Slide 9, and comparing Q3 to the prior year quarter; our Q3 reported net income from continuing operations was $210 million, including a tax benefit due to an IRS settlement and expected tax refunds in Australia.","As a result, we have adjusted our full year 2014 tax rate guidance to 17% to 22% to reflect our year-to-date results, including non-operating items. Our long-term operating tax rate outlook remains unchanged at 37% to 40%. Although we'll see quarter-to-quarter swings in our tax rate.","As you can see we experienced a 14% drop in revenue over the prior year quarter as a result of a 4% drop in the gold price and a lower production Gary described earlier.","We reported adjusted net income of $249 million or $0.50 per share. This was above the $217 million in the prior year quarter or $0.44 per share, as cost savings and tax gains more than offset lower gold production and pricing.","Cash provided from continuing operations was very strong at $328 million, reflecting our commitment to reducing cost and improving efficiency.","During the quarter, we also paid our previously announced dividend. Earlier this week, our board approved the dividend of the same amount payable in December of this year. This is based on our gold price-linked dividend policy and the average London P.M. Fix during the third quarter of $1282 per ounce.","We continue to be focused on generating value, and we achieved $51 million in positive free cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter. I'm also pleased to note that we're free cash flow positive on a year-to-date basis.","Turning to Slide 10, we reconcile Q3 net income to adjusted net income. The primary adjustments to our GAAP net income include a $17 million gain on asset sale, following the sale of Jundee and McCoy\/Cove during the quarter; $11 million of restructuring charges related to workforce reduction, $19 million of cost at Batu Hijau related to the suspended operation, and a $21 million tax valuation allowance related to our tax planning efforts.","After excluding these items, we reported adjusted net income of $249 million or $0.50 per share for the quarter. Due to the revised royalties and export duties agreed at Batu Hijau, we recorded a net realizable value or NRV stockpile adjustment of approximately $194 million; $160 million of this is attributed to CAS with the remainder attributed to depreciation and amortization.","Excluding these NRVs and suspension costs, our Batu Hijau copper CAS would have been approximately 78% lower for the quarter. In addition, excluding these NRVs and abnormal production costs at Batu Hijau, total company CAS would have been $688 per ounce and $2.26 per pound of copper.","And keep in mind that this applies to our sale volume, which is significantly higher than production this quarter particularly for copper as we continue to work down the Batu Hijau inventory built earlier this year. That's in contrast to the second quarter when our production was higher than sales. We've also returned $102 million to our shareholders so far this year.","Slide 12 illustrates our debt repayment schedule. As you can see, we do not have any significant debt due until 2019 and have maintained an investment grade rating and metrics, which remains a priority for Newmont. We have a $575 million convertible due in 2017, which we expect we could refinance in the capital market. A revolver has only one financial covenant maximum net debt to book capital of 62.5%, which we were at 27.9% as of September 30, 2014.","Our net debt at September 30th was $5 billion. Including the cash proceeds from the sale of La Herradura, which we received shortly after quarter end, our net debt would be $4.5 billion.","And now, I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Laurie. Turning to Slide 14; we're confident that we can continue our trajectory of lower cost and steady production, and we're improving our 2014 guidance again as a result. We're lowering our outlook for gold cost applicable to sales between $710 and $750 per ounce for the year.","Four of our five regions have also lowered their outlook for gold all-in sustaining costs. This adds up to a reduced outlook of between $1020 and $1080 per ounce.","Our 2014 capital expenditure outlook has also been reduced by nearly 20% as we continue to realize savings through our full potential program and other improvement initiatives. Finally, the only change to our 2015 and 2016 guidance was to remove La Herradura.","Let's turn to Slide 15 for a quick update on Merian. As I mentioned earlier, we recently received our Right of Exploitation from Merian, which triggered the start of construction. Mining equipment is arriving on site and we're clearing grounds for the process facilities and camp.","We'll be mining near-surface saprolite ore for the first five or six years. During that period, we expect average annual production of between 400,000 and 500,000 ounces of gold at all-in sustaining cost of between $750 and $850 per ounce. These cost estimates are escalated. And if you're to exclude inflation, they would be closer to the bottom of that range.","I'll also point out that Merian's stripping ratio is 3 to 1 for the life of the mine, which compares favorably to other open pit projects.","Finally, we have gold reserves of 4.2 million ounces and resources of 1.7 million ounces, and exploration continues to yield positive results. You can see here on this slide on the lower right, the target area is denoted in doted red where we're looking to extend the deposit out to the southeast and the northwest, and also to do in-fill drilling along the center of the central pit there, Merian II pit.","Turning to Slide 16; another growth options, we've improved the value and viability of our project pipeline significantly over last year. In Nevada, the Turf Vent Shaft is expected to reach full depth of 2050 feet in the first quarter of 2015, and to achieve commercial production by the fourth quarter.","The shaft will allow the region to increase high grade ore to mill 6, adding 100,000 to 150,000 ounces annually, while improving cost and efficiency.","In New Zealand, we're extending the life of our Waihi operations through our new Correnso mine. We continue to take a phased approach to developing Long Canyon, which represents another promising new district. The first phase is expected to deliver about 150,000 ounces of production per year at competitive cost. We anticipate reaching a decision on whether to proceed during the first quarter of 2015.","In Africa, we're advancing the Ahafo mill expansion, which will help offset the impacts of lower grade ore. We're looking to reach a decision on this project in the latter half of 2015. Developing Ahafo Subika underground mine would give us access to ore with grades that are four times higher than the surface mine, and add 200,000 ounces of production annually. We expect to reach a decision on Subika by early 2016.","In Australia, we're advancing our Tanami expansion project. This new project is an outcome of our full potential program and includes constructing a second decline in the mine. We anticipate reaching a decision to fund this project in early 2015.","Moving to South America, we continue to explore our options with Conga, but would not proceed without social acceptance and solid project economics. We're also exploring the possibility of bringing in an additional partner. Options to extend mine life in Yanacocha include the Ynacocha sulfides and Chaqui sulfides projects, as well as Quecher, a potential oxide mine near the existing pit. Our work to optimize our pipeline will continue, and I look forward to bring you more news in these projects in early 2015.","Wrapping up on Slide 17; we've had another great quarter, and we continued to focus on delivering on our three primary commitments; continuous cost and efficiency improvement, which means operating more efficiently, portfolio optimization by divesting non-core assets and developing the next generation of Newmont mines, and value creation by maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving shareholder returns.","Thank you for your time. I'd like to now turn it back to the operator to field questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from David Haughton with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","Good morning, Gary and Laurie, and others in the room. Thank you for the update. A surprisingly strong quarter coming through for you guys, which is good to see, and you've maintained your production guidance. It implies a fairly strong fourth quarter, and in a few of your operations it suggests that, that quarter would be better than what we had seen previously for the other three quarters, specifically at Yanecocha, Tanami and Boddington. ","Can you just talk about your confidence in making sure the fourth quarter is a record for the year?","Gary Goldberg","I'm happy to do that, David. And as I look at those three specific operations, and we have flagged that, Yanecocha in particular, that the grades and the production in the first half would be made up and come back strongly in the second half. That looks to be well on track.","Tanami is going through a transition in their mining areas, which will be changing during the fourth quarter, and that we expect to see better grades in Boddington, partially grades, but also we had the mill shutdown in the third quarter that was -- we expect to see that moving forward in the fourth quarter as well as location of where we're at in the mine. So confident very well in all three of those areas that will be coming in, and like we've been here over the last several quarters within our overall guidance.","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","And moving into the better mine sequencing at those operations, do you see those better grades carrying over into 2015?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. We plan to give an update on our '15 through '17 guidance here over the next couple of months, but right now we see basically -- well, Yanecocha will go through a changeover that three-year period, which we've already highlighted as production comes off, but really see that production continuing well at those two, and the rest of our operations. We'll see a bit of a recovery. So we've talked about before in -- and I don't want to get into all the details of all the different regions, we'll save that for a couple of months from now, but at Carlin as we get through the stripping phase at both Carlin and then also at Twin Creeks.","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","And also on the saving front, good saving on the capital front; it looks like your guidance is down over 200 million for the year. To what extent should we be thinking about those savings being deferrals versus outright savings?","Gary Goldberg","It's the big thing I keep an eye on, David. When we look in -- we've just been going through our planning perhaps as for '15 to '17 and you can expect to see those sustaining capital cost to remain consistent through the three-year period going forward from this year.","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","Okay.","Gary Goldberg","No carpet rolls is the term that I use.","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","Can you repeat that, sorry?","Gary Goldberg","No carpet rolls is the term that I use. No bumps out there. We haven't deferred and pushed things out till next year.","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","Okay. And then, just over to Batu Hijau back in there now and presumably getting into the better grade material from Phase 6 into next year. Will that timing work for you to be able to get into that high grade material during the dry season?","Gary Goldberg","Yes. In fact good point in terms of where pit water levels are, but we look good in 2015 timing-wise, second quarter to be matched with what we've planned for our forecast going out through '15. We have the wet and dry seasons and we work up in the upper part of the areas as we go through and make sure we match the pit pumping, but it does coordinate well.","David Haughton - Bank of Montreal","Okay. Thank you, Gary.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian MacArthur with UBS. You may ask your question.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Hi, good morning. Just following up on Batu Hijau, in your guidance I see we still continue to assume we're going to sell down our next 7%. Now that everything's resolved there, are we actually making progress on that or is that just an assumption you made for (indiscernible), obviously if you can sell that, that will help bring down the balance sheet as well?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, Brian. We continue to maintain that assumption because we have an agreement with the government for them to acquire that 7% stake. At this stage there haven't been any real substantive discussions in with the change of government. They'd just have to see whether they want to take that option up, but it hasn't been an issue either. I think as we went through our discussions around changes to the MoU, the need to divest was not an issue. That was raised with the government.","So, although we're at 44%, this is the last 7% of divestiture, it hasn't been raised as an issue by the government. So it's one we'll keep people posted on if that situation changes. But we've made that assumption in our plan for now going forward that it goes into effect from the beginning of the year.","Brian MacArthur - UBS","Great, thanks very much.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Chidley with HSBC. Your line is open.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Good morning, Gary, everybody.","Gary Goldberg","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","I just wanted to ask a quick question about the elephant in the room which is the gold price obviously coming down significantly today and this last couple of weeks. I'm wondering if you can give us any color on what's going on the refining side, and if you're seeing good demand at the Valcambi refinery and what sort of comments on the physical flow of metal that maybe you can anoint us with.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Patrick. I think as we look at -- we can look at the gold price day-to-day, but I'm really pleased over the last two years the work we've been doing within the business to make sure that we're prepared for lower prices, and don't have to be making knee-jerk shifts within the business as we address the market environment.","As we've looked at things, and I tend to look at things in the medium to long-term on where that is, we do see good strong demand into China, in particular, and good flows from Valcambi into India is what we've been seeing. So I think with the price and what we've seen as prices have dropped ground in this range or now lower today, we've seen a good response in terms of buying in the marketplace that tends to support price. But with that said, we continue to keep focused on controlling what we do control within the business.","Patrick Chidley - HSBC","Right. Okay, good. Anyway, thanks very much and congratulations on the quarter.","Gary Goldberg","Thanks, Patrick.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Quail with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Andrew Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, morning guys. Congratulations on a good quarter, and thanks for taking my question. Firstly, maybe one to Laurie, can we dig down to the tax adjustments, and add just add a little bit more detail on that tax refund in Australia.","Laurie Brlas","Sure. There were a variety of tax things that happened during the quarter, and we've got one question before on why we carve certain things out and not others. The piece that we carved out from adjusted net income was related to prior years and it wasn't a settlement and part of it is going forward how we can treat NRVs in Australia.","The piece that is in the current quarter is related to some of the sales that we had; the asset sales and the valuation allowances on those. There is quite a bit of detail in the 10-Q and we can mark you through in more detail if you'd like.","Andrew Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And the first refund, is that (indiscernible) in there as well or is that number sort of say like, second part of the whole tax adjustment?","Laurie Brlas","Well, there is a refund that we expect that we haven't received yet. So it wouldn't be in our cash yet.","Andrew Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, got you. Okay, I understand. And (indiscernible) obviously with Merian and may be with some of Patrick's question, I mean, is there gold pricing the back of your mind, this might be slowed down or is it sort of now we've got the permit, it's forced on your head?","Gary Goldberg","No, Andrew. As you look at Merian and also the Turf Vent Shaft, those are projects we've initiated and moving forward with. We've got the government that has a decision to make and they appear to be moving forward to prepare for it in Suriname to take on up to a 25% equity interest, which reduces the cost. I think with our current cash position in we're at, we're in a strong position and move forward. It's a good project and it's a good returns in the first five or six years producing 400,000 to 500,000 ounces a year. So we'll keep an eye on the market obviously if it changes dramatically more, but today I don't see that changing.","Laurie Brlas","Yes, that's right. With the cash balance we ended the quarter with and then the addition of both sales of our La Herradura cash coming into after the quarter that puts us in a good position to fund it.","Andrew Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And is that -- those inflation rates you're talking about, is that (indiscernible) what's the sort of -- is that obviously we've done CapEx as well. But is that what's the split of like U.S dollar versus other currencies?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, what we've built in and I do this in part as a rigor within the business that people have to work to offset inflation. So we basically have built into our plans a 3% a year inflation into both our operating and our capital costs, and it's Chris and his team' task to look at ways to pull potential and other ways to offset that. For instance, supply cost, we've been meeting with suppliers here for almost the two-year period looking at changes in our longer term contracts we have with them and renegotiating terms to ones that make more sense in today's marketplace.","Andrew Quail \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Truly, thanks guys.","Gary Goldberg","Great. Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Good morning; Jorge with DB. I guess maybe my first question is for Laurie. I just was looking at the full year guidance that you're maintaining for other expenses, which is on an annual 2014 basis still quoted at a 150 to a 175 million. You've done a 161 million of these other expenses in the first nine months. So, would seem that you've kind of hit your mid-point. So, my question is could you just shed some more light on what those actual recurrent other expenses are. Are you looking for basically zero in the fourth quarter and why you keep using that category as opposed to putting them say inside of cost of goods sold or SG&A as they do seem to be recurrent to support the business?","Laurie Brlas","Yes. There's a variety of things that go through there. I mean, regional admin and community development are the main expenses that go through there. But we also would have severance and that hit this quarter and some of the severance would be something we would carve out normally. So, that probably is a, the severance is a little higher than we would have originally anticipated at the beginning of the year.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Is there the likelihood that you're going to again use this category than in the fourth quarter, so that you might exceed your full year guidance metric there?","Laurie Brlas","On a GAAP basis, we might, but on an adjusted basis we wouldn't because of severance in there.","Jorge Beristain - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And my other question is in again this probably falls to you. Would it be possible to start including a kind of an EBITDA and or an adjusted EBITDA for Newmont just given the numerous charges we've seen as operations or facing head wins. It just makes a very difficult to kind of calculate core operating cash flow for the company. So, that's just a request I would put out there.","Laurie Brlas","We'll take that under in five minute and have a discussion about that. Thanks, Jorge.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anita Soni with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse","All right. Good morning, guys. Just a question -- two questions, first with regards to the other income what was in that bucket of 79 million?","Laurie Brlas","That would be the gain on sale of the assets that we had, is the biggest item on it and then also some of our foreign hedging gains would come through there as well.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse","Hedging gains, okay. And what again do you have hedging gains?","Laurie Brlas","Pardon?","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse","For your hedging, what specifically are those hedging gains that (indiscernible).","Laurie Brlas","Australian dollar.","Gary Goldberg","Primarily, the Australian dollar is the largest portion of it. We also do a little bit with the Kiwi and some diesel fuel hedging.","Laurie Brlas","It's primarily the Australian dollar.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse","And second question is with respect to the gold price. What -- remind me again what you've used to estimate your reserves last year and what your resources were done at?","Gary Goldberg","Anita, we used $1300 for reserve price and $1400 for resource price.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Gary Goldberg","Thank you, Anita.","Operator","Our final question comes from Adam Graf with Cowen. Your line is open.","Adam Graf - Cowen","Final question; wow, okay, I've got one final question but it's in four parts. How is that?","Laurie Brlas","Okay.","Gary Goldberg","Go for it.","Adam Graf - Cowen","Could you guys, when we were out in August and at the Carlin operations and looking at the Turf Vent Shaft, you guys put out a pretty detail posture there of how you saw the ramp-up and it look like you guys were expecting to double throughput capacity there through the Greater Turf Leeville. And maybe you can give us some further details about how that ramp, how you see that ramp up in coming through in 2015 and in 2016.","Gary Goldberg","","Sure, Adam. What I'll do is hand it over to Chris Robison to go through it. It definitely isn't doubling the throughput, but over to Chris.","Chris Robison","Adam, I think as Gary mentioned earlier, we increased production with the Turf Vent Shaft. We increased production somewhere in the 115,000 ounces per year going forward. I think what that graph showed was also showing without the Turf Vent Shaft, the decline in production that would occur. But anyway the project is on as Gary mentioned earlier on plan in terms of time and price, probably couple of weeks ahead actually, but again, certainly not doubling production.","Gary Goldberg","I think if we come on at the end of '15, then we'd see the full impact in 2016. ","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Could you give us an idea of what you're expecting them expecting them out of the Greater Turf Leeville in 2016?","Gary Goldberg","","Yes, what we'll do Adam, when we go and give guidance for the future years, which will do here in next couple of months as we rollout the '15 through '17 guidance. We'll give more detail on that?","","Adam Graf - Cowen","Jumping to the other side of the world, on Correnso and Waihi, I know you're spending some money there. Could you give us an idea what the remaining mine life would be. I remember at one point Waihi was an asset you guys would consider selling and I wonder that's still on the block?","Gary Goldberg","Yes, I think what we always get lots of people knocking on the door, not lot of them have cash, but we'll always talk if there's the right value there on any of our assets, but with regards to Waihi, the Correnso extension added about three or four years of mine life. We have recently also obtained access to the area to the north of the pit that we didn't have the exploration tenements on. So doing drilling there to see what extensions might go in the other direction at Waihi.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Okay. (Indiscernible) you got at least another four-five years?","Gary Goldberg","","Three or four years.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Three or four years. And then at Tanami with the construction you guys are doing -- the expansion you guys are doing there and then with the potential to add federation to Tanami operations, what's the mine like you guys are looking at there?","Gary Goldberg","","We're looking at literally, decades in terms of additional mine life there. Currently up to 2025 but when you look -- we haven't included federation in that at this stage because it's still undergoing exploration. The key with Tanami what this expansion program we're talking about, they were currently mine constraint and we're looking to add just like decline there to remove that constraint movement of the mine equipment.","At some point in future we'll move deeper and we'd look to put in a shaft that's not what we're talking about at this stage. It's really doing things through the decline and the double decline improving the mine efficiency, we'll do some small things at the mill to make sure it can handle the additional ores that's coming through. That's really the crux of it. It's in terms of return. It's one of the better projects I've seen. We talk more about that once we get to an approval stage at early next year.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","It's to maintain the 6000 to 7000 tons a day of throughput level?","Gary Goldberg","","It actually is to improve that throughput level.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Okay, very good, very good.  And then maybe just hopping over to Africa, for this Subika underground project, what's the range of upfront CapEx to get that up and running?","Gary Goldberg","","It's in roughly $200 million to $250 million rage to bring that up and running. We've actually, with some of the work we've done, we've test ops to test ground conditions, and recoveries, we're seeing good results there but doing -- we received an exploration permit there in the last couple of months to extend and do more drilling underground and we're doing that now to confirm the continuity, the ore body and the quality of the grades.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Excellent. When -- I apologize, when you're going to bring that -- when you think you can bring that to the board for a decision? ","Gary Goldberg","","That one would come in early 2016. That's what we have in the timeline today.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","I'm sorry. That's when it comes to the board or that's when you break ground and \u2026","Gary Goldberg","","That's when it comes to the board.","Adam Graf - Cowen","","Got it. Excellent. Thank you for taking all my questions.","Gary Goldberg","","No. No worries, thanks, Adam, I appreciate the questions and I appreciate everybody's questions here in this morning in obviously turbulent gold price environment. I think the business continues to deliver as we have committed to along the way. I appreciate the efforts that our team are making to keep focused on controlling what they control. Thank you for your interest, and have a good rest of your day.","","Operator","","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the call over to John Seaberg, Vice President of Investor Relations for Newmont Mining Corporation. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","John Seaberg","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Newmont's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today are Richard O'Brien, Chief Executive Officer; Gary Goldberg, President and Chief Operating officer; Russell Ball, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and other members of our executive leadership team.","Turning to Slide 2. Before we discuss the quarterly results, I'd like to refer you to our cautionary statement as we will be discussing forward-looking information which is subject to a number of risks, as further described on our -- in our SEC filings, which can be found on our website at newmont.com.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Richard O'Brien.","Richard T. O'Brien","Thanks, John.","Before we jump into the quarter, I'd like to take a few minutes to comment on the recent announcement regarding Gary Goldberg's promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer. I worked with the board to recruit Gary to Newmont last year, and I recommended this promotion in recognition of the scope of his responsibilities and the substantial contributions he's already made in Newmont. As you know, Gary joined Newmont in December of last year with a 30-year track record of success at Rio Tinto. Throughout his career, Gary has been widely recognized for his achievements in safety, environmental stewardship and social responsibility. He's quickly come up to speed on our business, opportunities and challenges and has proven himself to be an outstanding addition to Newmont's senior leadership team. As a reminder, today Gary is responsible for worldwide operations; projects of safety and loss prevention, security solutions and innovation; and business excellence.","Gary and I have developed an excellent working relationship and I look forward to continuing our work together as we build on our existing foundation of capital discipline, balance sheet strength, profitable operations, extensive exploration and project opportunities in our industry-leading dividend policy. Many of you have already met Gary, some at our recent Investor Day, and going forward, you will have many opportunities to get to know him better.","This week, we also announced the election of Kofi Bucknor to our Board of Directors. Kofi brings significant financial expertise, as well as extensive knowledge of Ghana in Africa.","I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the passing of the Ghanaian President John Atta Mills. We appreciated the support from President Mills over the past years and know that he will be remembered for his statesmanship and years of dedicated service to his country.","Now turning to Slide 3. As we talked about in May at our Investor Day in New York, we reaffirmed our commitment to offer shareholders a combination of profitable growth, disciplined returns, strong exploration potential, balance sheet strength and our industry-leading gold price-linked dividend.","Our second quarter and year-to-date operating results performed in line with our budget. Exploration is on track to cover reserve depletion and exceed 100 million ounces of reserves in 2012. As expected, our second quarter gold production was impacted by annual planned mill maintenance in Nevada, lower tons mined at Tanami in Australia and lower gold and copper production from Batu Hijau in Indonesia as we continue with the planned stripping to Phase 6. While we had a few items in the quarter that impacted our earnings, which Russell with speak to later in the call, we remain generally on track to deliver on our financial and operational goals established at the beginning of this year.","As noted in our earnings release yesterday, we're narrowing our 2012 outlook for attributable gold production to 5 to 5.1 million ounces, while maintaining our outlook for CAS of $625 to $675 per ounce. We've also lowered our 2012 attributable capital expenditure outlook by approximately $300 million, primarily as a result of our slower development timetable at Conga in Peru.","We expect our advanced projects expenditures to be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower in 2012, primarily as a result of our deferred development plans in Peru, as well as our refined scopes of work at several of our early-stage projects in Nevada and in our Asia Pacific region. Similarly, we expect our exploration and G&A spending to be lower by approximately $40 million to $50 million this year and 10 to 12 -- $10 million to $20 million in G&A: so $40 million to $50 million for exploration, $10 million in G&A.","We're also mindful to balance our desire for increased efficiency with our continued commitment to build a healthy, more efficient and growing business, which is entirely consistent with what we discussed with you at Investor Day. So as a result, our adjusted outlook for advanced projects exploration and G&A spending has been reduced by approximately $100 million for 2012. As we continue to optimize our portfolio of projects and businesses, as we refine our plans and focus on total cost reductions, we do expect to identify further efficiencies and cost savings for 2013. And we will share that with you when we communicate our 2013 expectations.","We also remain committed to capital discipline and shareholder return. Earlier this week, we also announced a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share based on last quarter's average afternoon gold fix of $1,609 per ounce. At our current share price, this equates to a yield of approximately 3%.","Turning to Slide 4. As many of you know, our project pipeline includes a number of advance-stage development opportunities, such as the Akyem project in Ghana, which Gary will talk about in a bit, as well as some earlier-stage opportunities that we continue to optimize and refine. Our portfolio has the potential to reach 6 to 7 million ounces of attributable gold production over the next 5 years, depending on future events in Peru as well as the results of our ongoing earlier-stage project optimization efforts across each of our regions. We will keep you informed of our progress and evaluation of our earlier-stage projects, including Subika, the Ahafo Mill project, Waihi, Merian and Long Canyon, as well as various regional expansion opportunities.","Turning to Slide 5. Conga is still in our plans, but moving ahead on a very measured basis. We are focused on the construction of additional reservoirs, completing the construction of the camp in engineering and the final procurement of major equipment, while at the same time working closely with the government and the community to build this project in a safe environmentally and socially acceptable manner.","In support of this effort for 2012 and 2013, we have, as we've communicated previously, revised our estimates for capital spending at Conga to $440 million on an attributable basis. Thus far in 2012 we might have spent approximately $185 million in development of water reservoirs, engineering, equipment and camp construction. However, I must continue to caution that ongoing community unrest and protests could further delay advancement of those activities.","Our relationship with the communities in Peru is extremely important to us. We hope to continue working cooperatively with the government of Peru and the local communities, as well as with the regional government, through the mediation and dialogue process to develop a peaceful and amenable solution to the political, social and other issues that have led to protests and community unrest in the areas outside of our immediate area of influence around Conga. We note the recent Peruvian government cabinet changes and look forward to continuing to work closely with the government, with the new Prime Minister and continuing to support President Humala's social inclusion plan with responsible mining playing a key part.","As we've said, further development of the Conga project will occur only with local and national support and only if it can be done in a safe, socially, environmentally responsible manner with risk-adjusted returns that justify future investment.","Now I'll turn the call over to Russell Ball to discuss our second quarter financial and operating results.","Russell D. Ball","Thanks, Richard. Good day, everyone.","Turning to Slide 6, you will see the second quarter and year-to-date financial and operating numbers. Before jumping in, some context around the second quarter, which historically is our most challenging quarter due to scheduled roster maintenance in Nevada and seasonality issues at a number of our operations. Clearly, this quarter was no exception.","Having said that, from a production and CAS perspective, we're on budget for the first 6 months and we are significantly below budget on capital expenditures, a trend I expect to continue and not just because of the slowdown in Conga.","Reading the sales coverage this morning provided some interesting perspectives on the quarter. I think Stephen Walker at RBC summed it up quite nicely, and I quote, \"Earnings missed not as bad as it looks,\" as did John Bridges at JPMorgan: \"Numerous negative adjustments, but operations looking firm.\" I will explain why and provide a little perspective on the quarter's results.","Revenue was down 6% on lower gold and copper volumes and a lower realized copper price, partially offset by a higher gold price. Net income was in line with budget although significantly lower than the prior year quarter. This was due in large part to a $200 million quarter-on-quarter reduction in pretax income at Batu Hijau in Indonesia. We've discussed previously, you shouldn't expect a turnaround at Batu Hijau until we get into Phase 6 ore, currently scheduled for early 2014.","Adjusted net income was $0.59 per share, largely in line with budget, but approximately $0.30 short of the consensus earnings estimate. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes stepping you through 5 items that account for about $0.24 or 3\/4 of that shortfall.","We incurred approximately $52 million in care and maintenance costs at Hope Bay as we wind that project down. As you know, we wrote our investment offer at the year end, but in terms of U.S. GAAP, we were not allowed to accrue for all future care and maintenance costs, so we have to expense these as incurred, going forward. Due to the fact that we have no Canadian-sourced income, we also have to raise the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets, so pre- and post-tax numbers on Hope Bay are essentially the same. The resulting impact to earnings of that $52 million was about $0.10 a share. Going forward, we expect to spend approximately $50 million on closure costs at Hope Bay in the second half of the year before entering into a steady-state care and maintenance run rate of approximately $20 million a year starting in 2013.","We had a timing issue related to sales of concentrates that resulted in an inventory build for the quarter of approximately 40,000 ounces of gold and 9 million pounds of copper, reducing earnings by approximately $0.05. Going forward, to address this, we will be releasing quarterly production and sales volumes prior to releasing the quarterly financial results. The movements in finished goods inventory, which can be significant, are more visible and less of a surprise when we report earnings.","Operating costs for the second quarter were $5 above the high end of the annual guidance range at $681 an ounce or $30 above the midpoint of the range. This $30 delta above the midpoint reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share. For the full year, we maintained our original outlook of $625 to $675 an ounce despite narrowing the expected production range to 5 to 5.1 million ounces due to the operating challenges at the Tanami. I suspect we will end up slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range for we still have 2 quarters to go. $18 million negative mark-to-market adjustment on copper provisional pricing reduced earnings by $0.02 per share. And finally, the quarterly tax rate was at the top end of the previous guidance range. The delta above the midpoint of the previous range to where we ended up for the quarter reduced earnings by 1\/3 or $0.02 a share. We have narrowed the tax rate outlook for 2012 to 30% to 32% while continuing to work on a number of tax planning opportunities for the second half of the year.","So clearly, a lot of noise this quarter, but I remain confident we will deliver what we promised for the full year. This is a long-term business that is volatile by nature, but being public, it's one that gets judged every 90 days.","Slide 7. As noted previously, the operations generally performed in line with budget. Attributable gold production of 1.18 million ounces was, however, marginally below the year-ago quarter. Gold costs applicable to sales of $681 an ounce were up 17% with higher-than-budgeted costs in Boddington, Ahafo, Tanami and Waihi, offset by a strong quarter at Yanacocha, Jundee and KCGM. Copper costs applicable to sales reflect the ongoing Phase 6 waste removal and processing of low-grade stockpiles at Batu Hijau. Gary will spend some time covering the operating results in more detail, shortly.","Turning to Slide 8. As outlined in our dividend release earlier this week, we modified our gold price-linked dividend policy to provide greater visibility and transparency to the realized gold price used to calculate the amount of the dividend. Under the old policy, we linked the dividend to our net realized gold price, which is calculated after treatment and refining charges and any mark-to-market adjustments on provisional pricing. Going forward, we have linked the dividend to the average London P.M. gold fix for the quarter, which is an independently published number. This will eliminate any bias for us and hopefully provide greater clarity and visibility into the expected dividend, although as noted previously, the actual dividend remains subject to board approval.","Moving to Slide 9. The second quarter average London P.M. gold fix of $1,609 announced translates into $1.40 annualized dividend or $0.35 for the quarter. The dividend is payable on September 28 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 6.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks, Russell, and good morning. Before reviewing the operating results for the quarter, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Richard for his kind opening remarks at the beginning of our call.","I joined Newmont last year because of the company's reputation as a leader in sustainable development, the quality of its people and attractive opportunities for profitable growth and sustainable increases in shareholder value. The company also has a strong commitment to safety, profitability and growth, which are 3 areas that have been priorities for me throughout my career. Since I joined Newmont, I've had the opportunity to visit many of our locations and what I have seen only reinforces my optimism about the company's strengths and opportunities and the quality of our people.","From a financial perspective, Newmont has differentiated itself from industry peers with its financial discipline. The company has a strong balance sheet and has delivered industry-leading per share performance in gold reserves, attributable gold production and operating cash flow. Newmont's gold price-linked dividend is unique in the industry and gives their shareholders direct leverage to gold prices. As Richard said, the board and management team are aligned around Newmont's strategic directions, and we are all focused on executing the plan in driving value for our shareholders.","To be clear, while I'm excited about Newmont's strengths, opportunities and prospects, I am also well aware of the challenges, including rising total costs and increasing political and social pressures, we and others in the industry face, also including political and social pressures in some locations. I've been working closely on these issues with Richard and the rest of the Newmont team and we'll continue to do so as we sharpen our focus on profitable growth.","As Richard mentioned at Investor Day, we have our regional operating teams and corporate teams focused on addressing our total cost. This includes operating costs, sustaining costs, our G&A costs and our project execution costs. We're leaving no stone unturned. And we'll share this with you as we provide our guidance for 2013.","I'm very excited to be a part of the Newmont team and the opportunities in front of the company. I appreciate the confidence Richard and the board have placed in me. I hope to earn your confidence as well by doing everything I can to create value for you in the years to come.","And now I'd like to recognize the quick-responding colleagues at our Waihi mine. As most of you may have heard last week, we had a truck fire in the Trio underground mine in Waihi in New Zealand, which required 28 of our colleagues to take refuge in safety chambers and await rescue. Thankfully, our people acted quickly and all were safely rescued within 7 hours. This incident ended without injury because of the training and the quick and professional response of the team at Waihi.","Turning to Slide 10, you'll see that lower year-over-year production from our Asia Pacific and Africa regions were offset by increases in North and South America. Those production impacts are reflected in our costs, with Asia Pacific incurring the largest increase in costs as we experienced nonrecurring mill maintenance costs at Boddington and spread higher stripping costs, particularly at Batu Hijau and Waihi, across a lower production base. As Russell mentioned, our second quarter CAS was higher than the market's expectations. However, costs were within our budget and we remain on track to meet our full year guidance.","Turning to Slide 11. In North America, we had a good quarter relative to last year, looking at production. That said, the second quarter production was down from the first quarter. This is historically Nevada's lowest quarter as we do our annual Mill 6 maintenance. This was performed as scheduled during the April -- late April, early May time frame. We're happy to report also that the ventilation shaft repairs at Leeville are complete and operations are back on track.","We also received positive news at Long Canyon. The notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement was issued for Long Canyon on July 19. This opens the door to a 45-day public comment process. To quote Tom Kerr, our Senior Vice President of North America, \"Engaging the public early will help us to ensure our high standards meet community expectations.\" We also received our permits, which allow us to continue to expand our exploration efforts around Long Canyon.","Turning to our South America region, on Slide 12. Q2 attributable production of 213,000 ounces was 10% higher than a year ago as we processed higher-grade material and achieved higher recoveries. While we are ahead year-to-date at Yanacocha due to mine sequencing of the higher-grade material in the first half, we expect to finish the year in line with the current production guidance.","Moving to Slide 13. Our Asia Pacific region was impacted by lower tons mined at both Tanami and Waihi. Tanami production was well below plan due to issues related to a shortfall of backfilling in the mine that limited access to planned stopes. Steps have been taken to address this shortfall, but it will take some time to address. Shaft development is progressing, albeit at a slower rate given the backfill issues. At Waihi, we had a shortfall of ore mining in the open pit due to a quarter 1 wall failure and a delay in development work in the underground mine. Both the Tanami and Waihi shortfalls will not be made up in 2012, and we have adjusted our production guidance accordingly.","Our costs were impacted by lower production in Tanami and Waihi, the higher stripping at Batu Hijau, as well as the mill maintenance cost I previously mentioned at Boddington, which included tertiary crusher overhauls -- overhaul, major liner replacements and a mill motor replacement, as well as the related downtime.","Regarding the divestiture of the last 7% tranche at Batu Hijau in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court has given notice that it will read its decision next Tuesday on the central government's capability to buy the 7%. This decision should provide clarity on who will be the owner of this 7% stake in PTNNT. The current guidance assumes 48.5% ownership for the remainder of 2012.","On Slide 14, we've summarized second quarter performance of Ahafo in Africa where production of 132,000 ounces was down 9.5% from the second quarter last year due to lower throughput and grade. Cost was $583 per ounce, up from a year ago due to lower production and a higher direct mining costs. The Akyem project is currently 53% complete and is tracking on schedule and on budget, with first production expected in late 2013.","I'd like to now turn the call back over to Richard.","Richard T. O'Brien","Thanks, Gary.","As we've said for a number of years, execution matters. We must do what we say we will do, and for 2012 that means deliver on our 2012 plans. We're halfway through 2012 and we're well positioned to do just that: deliver on our plans for 2012.","For the future, we remain focused on delivering profitable growth, realizing exploration potential and ensuring competitive project returns on capital. Recognizing that, when things change with respect to potential social, political and other risks, we will incorporate those changes and risks into our project claims and returns and ensure that our projects continue to remain viable. We don't believe that growth in any cost is a winning strategy.","We continue to have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, which affords us the flexibility to be selective on the projects we develop, while continuing to reward our shareholders with one of the best dividends in the industry. We will maintain that strong balance sheet.","And finally, we're focused on reducing our total costs, not just operating costs and not just capital costs, but all of our costs right through the portfolio, from the exploration stage all the way through closure. And we'll do so while ensuring we maintain focus on delivering longer-term value in accordance with the strategy we discussed with you at Investor Day.","Thank you for listening into our call. And operator, we'll now open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question\u2019s from John Bridges, JPMC.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","John Bridges. So I was just wondering -- a lot of the adjustments that are, of course, perfectly normal seem to have gone negative this quarter. I just wondered if there's not a better way of giving us some guidance so we don't get the negative surprises.","Russell D. Ball","John, it's Russ. A fair comment, and you're right, this quarter they did negative. Clearly, with us releasing production and sales numbers we\u2019ll be able to address the inventory issue upfront. We do have a lot going on in the portfolio. And you're right, this quarter, most did go against us. I\u2019ll work with John's group in particular and we'll figure out a mechanism how we can, if there are events that -- Hope Bay may be the best example in this quarter. I think most people had assumed, and maybe that's shame on me, that the accrual at the end of the year took care of Hope Bay going forward. Unfortunately, we can't accrue for those costs, and that's why on the call I tried to provide some perspective on it going forward, so I take your point. And John and I will sit down and figure out what we need to do, obviously bearing in mind we got regulatory issues we will just need to work through. But your comment\u2019s valid and we certainly take it on-board.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, it\u2019s a shame when Gary's mines are ticking along quite nicely to have a result, which looks -- which is giving the wrong impression. And then, Gary, I wondered if -- we had a nice chat at Investor Day. I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on the potential you see to work on costs. I suppose you will need a new truck at Waihi. But I just wondered what -- if you can give us some guidance on where you see costs going.","Gary J. Goldberg","Thanks, John. I appreciate it. Yes, of course, the new truck at Waihi. But when you look across the portfolio, and as Richard and Russell also mentioned, we've got a process going on where we're taking a look at really the whole portfolio: looking at our operating costs, looking at our sustaining capital, looking at our project execution costs, and ultimately you\u2019ve got to go right back to the mine plans and the details that sit behind that. So making sure I bring maybe a little bit different background coming from base metals and some different things, that we are putting the rigor around some of the planning processes and the reconciliation processes to make sure that we're able to deliver what we say we're going to deliver, that we fully understand the variability around that and that, and that, that shows up into our plans. The teams definitely have done a great job over the years of delivering against targets, when you look at our performance, but want to continue to do that, but also make sure we've got a good eye towards costs. So we'll be in a position later this year, as we pull together our 2013 plans, to deliver that information in terms of the details around guidance for the plan for 2013 and going forward. So there's opportunities there clearly that I'm focused on, and I look forward to sharing with those -- those with you in the future.","John D. Bridges - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In terms of time frame, you've given maintained guidance for costs, which maybe that's an element of efforts that you're putting in already. But are we talking about benefits that can come through next year or in a 3-year time frame? What sort of time frame do you see?","Russell D. Ball","So John, it's Russ. Maybe I can just add a little to Gary's commentary. As Richard spoke to in the analyst conference, we all focused on total cost of ownership. We have engaged an outside group to come in and challenge us, and we're working through that process right now. We gave you a little bit of an indication around 2012. We're still in the middle of the budget process for 2013, but it's fair to say, across the entire organization, folks are involved and focused on eliminating total cost. It's too early to give you numbers. We have to work through the steps internally and then with our board, but we will make this public when we announce not only '13 numbers but some indication of the 2014 and beyond run rate, because I think the run rate's probably the most important thing. We've all been involved with cost reduction exercises that take cost out, but they manage to somehow find them -- their way back into the organization. And the key for us is putting in place the process and the reporting and the mechanism to ensure that the cost we take out stay out, quite frankly. So that's where we're focused a little bit in the short term but significant opportunity above that, both on the capital and operating cost side, as we look at our first look at 2013. So towards the end of the year, John, we will, as Gary said, share that with you.","Richard T. O'Brien","And John, it's Richard. As I said on the call and I maintain, the management team here is focused on more efficient delivery of the same strategy that we've talked about. So we're still focused on developing our exploration potential right on through into the portfolio, executing our projects more efficiently and more effectively and delivering on our operations more effectively and more efficiently. So I look at this as continued refinement of the strategy that we have but delivering it better and more efficiently. And I know Gary's going to be a great partner in helping that to happen.","Operator","Our next question from Jorge Beristain, Deutsche Bank.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My -- Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. My question is, I guess, for Richard. Just noticed the strong uptick in the net debt position in the second quarter. You're up about 70% year-on-year to over $4 billion. And I was wondering how we should think about your CapEx prioritization going forward given that, if we do get a change in the gold price because of your dividend policy, we could start to see roughly 1\/2 of the incremental change in the gold price be paid out in dividends, and so it looks to me like you're very sensitive to any further changes in net cash cost. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how sacrosanct the current dividend policy is. And then, if it is sacrosanct, how would you view prioritizing your CapEx expense and if you could give us an idea of maybe rough numbers what you'd be looking into 2013. Do you think 2012 is really a lumpy year in terms of CapEx and things will smooth off going forward?","Richard T. O'Brien","Okay, so obviously a multipart question there, so let me take part of it. So how sacrosanct is the dividend? Look, we set the dividend policy. And we've been very clear about this since we set it: We set the dividend policy in ways that we think are sustainable over the longer term. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a policy, it would just be a moment. And so it is a policy. And as it suggests, that dividend policy does in fact enforce, and we like this, capital spending and other spending requirements to ensure that we can keep the balance. But remember, when we set this longer term, we didn't incorporate copper cash flows as we set the policy. We set it to make sure that the increments up in gold price were affordable based on our plans. And with respect to lumpy capital spending, we've been, I think, clear that 2012 and '13 on the old Conga plan were the years where we would have the predominance of capital spending with respect to our 6 to 7 million ounce delivery in 2017, with capital tailing off beginning in 2015. So there are 2 lumpy years -- sorry, '14 -- '12 and '13. We still believe that. Although, with Conga deferred, we're now actually generating $300 million of additional cash flow this year, less after-tax. So Jorge, what I would say is we continue to believe in the dividend policy. We continue to watch capital spending, and we will. And we continue to believe that we can balance returns on capital with returns of capital to shareholders to generate true economic value over the short and longer term, and we're going to continue to focus on that. With respect to the net debt position, I'm going to ask Russ to talk about what we've been able to accomplish here to actually ensure that we have a very strong balance sheet and low-cost debt on the balance sheet.","Russell D. Ball","Yes, Jorge, Russ. We obviously look at that. I will say that our net debt position is ahead of what we had budgeted. We're very comfortable with it. We've spent a fair amount of time with a rating agency discussing that capital profile and the lumpiness thereof. We've also -- as we look at the balance sheet, we have $1 billion-plus in short-term marketable securities that we have been very clear about with the market we consider as cash. So I really look at that as another $1 billion off of your net debt. We will monetize those at some stage. And again, part of the cost reduction exercise is a focus on free cash flow generation. And you should expect us to be focused on that and keep asking your questions around the net debt. We believe that some debt levels for a company of this size is appropriate and we'll continue to evaluate that trade-off. We've said all along investment grade rating is a key fundamental of the company and we intend to preserve it. So you should look for us to balance, as Richard said, our desire to return capital to shareholders with the long-term financial strength of the balance sheet.","Jorge M. Beristain - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, such a great point about the extra cash and marketable securities. Is there any kind of metric for your investment grade rating in terms of net debt to EBITDA or debt to EBITDA that we should keep in mind?","Russell D. Ball","Yes. We look at all the usual metrics, and you've hit on 2 of them. We look forward-looking versus some of the agencies which are obviously looking at more backward-looking information, but we continue to evaluate all of those. In light of the fact that we are an unhedged company, we will have a conservative balance sheet because we do take more financial risks to metal prices, being unhedged.","Operator","Our next question from David Haughton, BMO Capital Market.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Just on the topic of the build-up of inventory and timing of sales. Can you see that unwinding for the balance of the year? Or should we be thinking about this as a reasonable level to carry forward?","Russell D. Ball","Yes, David, Russ. We added about 240 million to the quarter to stockpiles and ore on leach pads. Some of the issues with the ore on leach pads is we're building higher pads and it's taking longer to get the ore out. In Nevada and at Boddington and Batu, we continue to -- not Batu, at Boddington we continue to build stockpiles as we look at optimizing cash flow, ounce productions and NAV. It was a little higher this quarter. I haven't looked at the detail around that for the rest of the year but we will -- we did also have included in that number the increase in finished goods inventory, the 40,000 ounces and the 9 million pounds, so that's obviously out the door subsequent to that quarter end. So yes, a little higher this quarter, around numbers about 100 million.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. Well, also, that build-up of inventory on the pads, as you described, together with the delays in recording the sales on the shipping of inventory would also help from improving your working cap position going into the balance of year too, I would expect.","Russell D. Ball","Correct. And also, just an observation on working capital: Q2, we tend to pay more taxes than the other quarters. So the tax run rate tends to pop up and in this quarter it was about $150 million higher than -- if you take the annual and divide by 4, we just have a number of payments due in the second quarter. So you're seeing that in the working capital and operating cash flow.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","All right. Just back to Batu. There had been a comment there that the sell-down of the last stench (sic) [tranche] might be imminent. Can you remind the -- us of the pricing of that last stench?","Richard T. O'Brien","The last tranche...","Russell D. Ball","David, it's Russ. I -- if memory serves, it was 2 49 [ph], but we'll get back to you. It's been so long. And there are some dividend adjustments related to the drop, I guess, sale and purchase agreements. So I'll get John to send you that. But if memory serves, it was 2 49 [ph], less dividends, from when we signed that agreement. And roughly 1\/2 of that would come to us.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","And is there any implication on your ability to consolidate Batu Hijau going forward compared to simply equity accounting with the dilution of your equity stake?","Russell D. Ball","No, David. Due to the accounting provisions around these variable interest entities, the VIEs, we share a disproportionate amount and we have the ability to control it. So we see at least for the foreseeable future that we will continue to consolidate that. If and when we think that may change, we\u2019ll certainly give you a heads-up as soon as we know.","Richard T. O'Brien","And just to be clear, David, what we said is that there would be a readout of the decision from the Constitutional Court about the 7% and the central government's authority to buy that 7%. What we didn't say is that that's going to lead to an immediate closing. We don't know what the outcome's going to be. We just know that there's going to be a reading, because that was announced publicly. So when that happens, we'll inform you all as to what that means, so look for that in the coming weeks.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Is there a possibility that you'd end up with a vendo financing of it so that's -- you don't actually get the cash?","Richard T. O'Brien","That's not the intent of the current purchase and sale agreement.","David Haughton - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. Last question. Finished copper, it sounds like you're making some good progress there. I just find that the way that your numbers are reporting Phoenix, although a separate entity in milling, is completely lost within the broader Nevada. Would you be separating those numbers out to give us a little bit more clarity about how that copper is progressing in the success or otherwise of the leach program?","Russell D. Ball","Dave, Russ. I'll add -- or I'll start and I'll ask Gary to add. It's a good question, it's one that Gary has asked since he's been here. As you know, historically we've reported Nevada as one unit as that's how we manage it. We are looking, as we drill down into costs, to getting a better understanding of the costs at each location. And we'll come back to you. I hear your point and I take it. Phoenix certainly has and continues to do very nicely relative to where it was historically. But I understand your issue and your desire to understand on a more asset specific. I'll ask Gary to give you his perspective, because at the end of the day, he owns these assets.","Gary J. Goldberg","No, thanks, Russ, and thanks, David. I think the key is we do have the information internally. It doesn't get reported externally in a way that you've just asked for, and we'll take a look at what we might be able to do it. But we do have the information, I see the details on how that and each part of the operation in Nevada is going. So we'll take a look at what we might do, especially as we get the copper leach on as well, to give you a little bit more information.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question, Patrick Chidley, HSBC.","Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","Everybody, just coming back to the free cash flow aspects of the quarter. Can you break down the $412 million of net change in operating assets and liabilities just a -- I take it that would include the $240 million that you just mentioned.","Russell D. Ball","Yes. Patrick, it's Russ. I think there's detail in Note 23, if memory serves, on the 10-Q, which went in last night. It's on Page 29.","Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","Okay. But basically, that stockpile and leach pad inventory bill -- is that the kind of rate that you'd expect long term as well? Or is this a special quarter?","Russell D. Ball","No, no. This is a -- and like I said, the second quarter had a little higher build to it than what we had anticipated. And included in that number that you see on that Note 29, the $443 million, is those -- or are those 40,000 ounces and 9 million pounds. So I'd say it's just a timing issue.","Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","And then the higher taxes.","Russell D. Ball","Yes, higher taxes, and you see that in the accounts payable and other accrued liabilities coming down, $227 million. Ignore the EGR refinery liabilities, the $406 million, that's noise.","Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","And then just also in terms of generating cash flow from the business, it seems if -- we saw Barrick yesterday. A lot of the bigger gold mining companies in particular are basically trying to prevent themselves from investing in lower-return projects and therefore shelving a lot of projects. And unfortunately, that comes with a lot of costs, such as we're seeing with Hope Bay this quarter. And I'm wondering if it's not better just to find an appropriate buyer for those assets and just get them out the door and then save the cash flow, because I can see that going on for quite some time at some of these things, Conga, Hope Bay, where you've got significant outgoings and not much coming in and a lot of delays, at the best-est case.","Randy Engel","Yes, Patrick, it's Randy. We have -- indeed, there are potential assets that we would love to divest if they don't meet our criteria and if there's a reasonable buyer out there.","Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","Because, I mean, I just think there's -- a lot of people in the market, a lot of investors, they just look at your free cash flow numbers and a lot of the cash flow or significant chunks of the cash flow are going to projects that you don't necessarily think are the highest-return projects, let's put it that way.","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes, I think, Patrick, we're pretty careful to make sure that we are investing our capital in those projects which are the highest return. And you'll note that we're not calling what we're spending at Hope Bay, even capital. We know it's an expense. We know we have to shut that mine down in -- or that exploration property down in a way which is sustainable. That was our commitment when we took the license on. That will not go on forever. And with respect to Conga, I think we've been very clear that, that project must have an economic return or we won't go forward, but it also has to have the support of the community. And we can't make that happen overnight. So I think it's a balance between spending the right amount of money in the right way to keep the option open, but not spending so much that we are not managing the project closely, something that I know Gary and his team do every day to make sure we're trying to make sure that we're as efficient as possible. But I take the point, as Randy said, just because we'd like to sell it doesn't mean somebody else wants to buy it, particularly at a price that we think or -- that we think is acceptable or one that would allow somebody to take on the obligations that we have in a way which we think is responsible. We've got to do both of those.","Randy Engel","And Patrick, I think we just re-implied, reinforced what Richard said earlier, which is, obviously what we're trying to do is make sure that we take a hard look at those projects that are marginal, but at the same time develop those projects that provide investors with upside gold price exposure and some free cash flow.","Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","Right, right. And then just a final question, just a broad-brush question on how you think the landscape is right now in terms of building projects, new projects, with seemingly ever-increasing capital expenditures versus just going and buying competitors.","Richard T. O'Brien","No, I -- thanks, Patrick. Obviously, you've got to look at both the challenges that we face on the project execution side are no different than our competitors' face with labor cost issues in certain parts of the world. You look to the short to medium term, maybe some parts of the commodities world backing off might be an opportunity in there. And we are looking through that as part of our costs where you looking at all the cost for executing on our projects. And we've got to make sure we build that into our look forward and our opportunities as well. But, I agree, we're no -- we're not immune to the same things our competitors are seeing in some of the costs.","Patrick T. Chidley - HSBC, Research Division","Right. But in terms of buying a competitor with a gold mine that's producing that you can actually buy the whole thing for less than building your own project, I mean, there must be opportunities like that, surely.","Randy Engel","As far as the producing targets go, Patrick, I think, once you've put on some sort of change in control premium, it gets pretty tight-defined targets that are better and cheaper than building them...","Richard T. O'Brien","But again, we look at efficient utilization of capital, and Randy's rating-and-ranking portfolio of external opportunities sits right next to Gary's rating and ranking of internal properties. And we do try to balance that and to the extent that -- it was Randy who says we can find something in the market that actually adds to our portfolio, both with respect to sustainability and return. I think that's something that we would take a look at, but it's got to have the same kind of return. We don't want to dilute shareholders or delude them by issuing a bunch of shares to buy something that might bring that same exact issues that we see that somebody else is having with development of their properties or running of their properties. So yes, I think it's always an opportunity we evaluate. It's a trade-off and it's one that we watch, again, pretty much every day.","Randy Engel","Yes. And there are a handful of targets that we've got prioritized, but again, you just -- you've got to wait for the right opportunity and you've got to weight that up against everything else you have inside.","Operator","Our next question from Brian MacArthur, UBS.","Brian MacArthur - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was wondering if you can just give me some guidance going forward on Yanacocha as it looks like, as you\u2019ve talked about, Conga may get pushed out. And you do have a good guidance in your chart, taking down production from 700,000 ounces in South America to 400, but can you -- or to -- can you just give me some guidance on what the cost structure would look like that goes along with that? If we don't get Conga going forward, as Yanacocha runs down over the next 3 or 4 years, what sort of the cost structure would look like vis-a-vis today?","Gary J. Goldberg","Brian, I'll go ahead and start, and then maybe Russ can add to that. We've got Carlos and the team down there taking a look. With obviously Conga rescheduled and some of the other early development projects like Quilish and some of the outside projects pushed off for right now, and rescheduling production over the next, especially 3, 4 to 5 years to see if we can smooth out that production profile, which will actually help from a cost standpoint and be more consistent over the next 3 years. We've got some work we're doing on water treatment that's coming in here in the next year or so to meet some of the higher end to -- for regulations that are being implemented in Peru. So that'll show up maybe early in the '13, '14 time frame. But right now, as we've got them -- we've got them looking at alternatives to really smooth out the production profile over the next 3 to 4 years before we go into decline.","Russell D. Ball","And Brian, Russ, just adding to that. We will be moving less tonnage, which clearly means that we will have less equipment and less people in those equipment moving that tonnage. That's part of the exercise Gary and his region working on. The challenge for us will be, can we reduce the costs by at least as much as the ounces to get to your per ounce number? We're still working through that exercise, but it would not surprise me to see reductions just given the change in the mine plan in the not-too-distant future.","Randy Engel","Brian, it's Randy. If you take the guidance that we've got, you've got about $350 million of operating costs attributable to Newmont there specific to Yanacocha base operations. I think, if you think about it in those terms and then you take into consideration what Russ described, you could see a reasonably stable total cost base for the next couple of years until it starts to come off harder in, say, the '15, '16 time frame.","Operator","Our next question from Michael Dudas, Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sterne Agee. Oh yes, regarding Conga, could -- can you maybe share, Richard, maybe some milestones or timing or when we might see a bit more clarity in the situation as you're modeling it out, say, for the next 6 to 12 months?","Richard T. O'Brien","Yes. So our major milestone is to ensure that the first thing we do is keep our project people and the community safe. And as long as that's happening, the milestone is, continue to build the reservoirs on the schedule that we have. And on most days, Gary's project team is able to continue to move that forward smoothly. A lot of what you read about in the press is actually outside of ring [ph] 2 and, in some cases, even outside of ring [ph] 3 in demonstrations around Conga and around other issues in the community. So the milestones unfortunately in that area, political, social, community, I think are milestones which unfortunately we don't get to drive. But what I would say is that the President of Peru and his Prime Minister, we know -- even his new Prime Minister, who we've not had the opportunity to meet yet but hope to soon, will continue to foster a dialogue table, a listening table in some respects, to provide hopeful outcomes for mediation. And I would expect that, that will continue over the next weeks and hopefully in the next month and we'll see if we can get some outcomes of that. To date, that has not happened, but we have been able to continue -- as I said, on almost all days to continue to work on the reservoir construction. And we're hopeful that, that reservoir construction will generate the water that people apparently are more worried about than we believe they should be because that water delivery system, we know, will work and be better than what's there existing and that, as we do that, hopefully we'll earn credibility with the local community, for sure, and hopefully outside of that. And we just want to be mindful that the milestones that are out there are milestones that are, one, achievable and, two, we can drive. Unfortunately, with respect to the regional government and the central government, a lot of what's happening there is more on the political and government side and we just -- we don't know how to help in that other than participate in the dialogue table. And we're hopeful that those will continue to be sponsored by the right people and that we'll get the right discussion going.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that answer, Richard. And a follow-up, maybe, I think, another political aspect towards -- turning to Ghana. With the untimely death of the President, as you mentioned earlier in the call, and with the transition there and with, I guess, elections coming up, any issues regarding transition or laws or legislations that would impede or maybe support or help your opportunities with the development of Ghana?","Richard T. O'Brien","The short answer is we don't see anything that's going to change that current environment in Ghana. I think, as President Obama has said historically, Ghana really is the shining light of democracy in West Africa. And it is that way because, even as the -- President Mills' election showed with less than 2% in terms of his voting in the last election, he came in smoothly with support of the Ghanaian people and really no issues in transition. We would expect that, that would continue to be the case in Ghana, which is 50-plus years into democracy. Our agreement, just to be clear, is one which has been approved by Parliament if for -- that covers both Akyem and Ahafo. On the other hand, that agreement is only as good as our continued commitment and the government's continued commitment to stay in dialogue about issues. And under Atta Mills, we had several layers of discussions going on with the government to ensure that changes in law around royalties and taxes were well understood, that those impacts under our current agreement were well understood. That dialogue is going on and, I would suggest, will continue to go on. And I think that it's that positive dialogue that allows us to continue to say that Ghana continues to be one of the best places for us in our future in terms of exploration potential, in terms of the ability to develop projects, in terms of the long-term support and commitment of the government and in terms of really having great people supporting us in the projects. So Ghana continues to be not just a shining light for democracy but, I think, a shining light for Newmont.","Okay. So that's the extent of our time today. Really appreciate your listening to our call and attending. And thanks for continued attention as we continue to deliver ongoing performance under our plan.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time.

All lines will be on a listen-only mode until we open for questions and answers. Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the call over now to Meredith Bandy, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.","Meredith H. Bandy - Newmont Mining Corp.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Newmont's third quarter earnings conference call. Joining us today are Gary Goldberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Laurie Brlas, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Palmer, our Chief Operating Officer.","With that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you for joining us this morning. Our team delivered another strong quarter by executing our strategy, which is to improve the underlying business, strengthen the portfolio and create value for shareholders. Before we get into the details, I want to cover some news.","First, we're welcoming Nancy Buese to the Newmont team as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer beginning October 31. Nancy is an accomplished finance leader with extensive experience in the natural resources sector and most recently served as Executive Vice President and CFO for MPLX, a publicly-traded energy company with $6 billion in revenues. Prior to that, she was CFO from MarkWest Energy Partners, a publicly-traded midstream energy company whose valuation grew from $50 million to $16 billion during her 11-year tenure.","I'd like to thank Laurie Brlas for her many contributions to Newmont. Laurie is retiring to focus on her board assignments and spend more time with family. She'll remain with us through the end of the year to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. Since Laurie joined Newmont, we've lowered net debt significantly and earned the gold sector's best credit rating.","The second news update, I'm pleased to announce increased dividends in the fourth quarter as a result of higher gold prices, and beginning in 2017, through our enhanced dividend policy. We're also putting strong free cash flow to good use by retiring more debt, and we announced this morning a $500 million debt tender.","Third, I want to recognize our team in Suriname for delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget. Finally, I'll point out that Batu Hijau was classified as an asset held for sale and reported as a discontinued operation in our third quarter and prior period financial results.","Turning to slide 2, please take a moment to review our cautionary statement before we turn to Newmont's performance for the quarter on slide 3. We continue to improve the business by lowering total injury rates by 12% compared to the prior-year quarter, keeping all-in sustaining costs at $925 per ounce, slightly higher than last year, but still in line with our 2016 guidance, and increasing gold production by 3% to 1.25 million ounces.","Portfolio improvements for the third quarter included completing Merian on schedule and $150 million below budget, and advancing Long Canyon, where we expect the first pour gold next month or about two months ahead of schedule.","We also continue to generate more value by increasing free cash flow by more than 50% over the prior-year quarter to $240 million, improving adjusted EBITDA by 30% to $666 million, lowering our net debt by another 13% and, most importantly, doubling our fourth quarter dividend and significantly enhancing our policy for 2017. This performance is underpinned by superior safety and sustainability.","Turning to slide 4, sending people home safely everyday is a matter of principle, and a great indicator of how well our operations are running. We've reduced our injury rates by 54% since 2012. We're also honored to be named the Mining Sector's Top Performer in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in the row. One of the standout performances for the quarter was at Merian, where the team has worked for five consecutive months without an injury, which is an exceptional record for an operation that's in transition.","Turning to slide 5, for more on that transition, we poured first gold and achieved commercial production at Merian on October 1. Our newest operation gives us a foothold in a prospective gold district and will deliver more than a decade profitable production. Merian also showcases our work to optimize projects and build them on schedule and budget, as well as our successful exploration program.","Over the last decade, our geologists have grown Merian from a maiden resource of a couple of hundred thousand ounces to a reserve and resource base of 4.5 million ounces. And we continue to see strong exploration results beneath and near the current mine.","Turning to Long Canyon on slide 6, construction is nearly complete and we began placing ore in the leach pad in April. We're confident that we will reach commercial production next month. We optimized this project by building a leach facility instead of a mill, relying on refurbished gear versus new gear and leveraging regional staff and infrastructure. Long Canyon's internal rate of return at a $1,200 gold prize is in the high teens. Here too, we've grown the reserve base to 1.2 million ounces by the drill bit, and mineralization remains open in all directions.","Moving to the full portfolio on slide 7, even after removing Batu Hijau, we've lowered our all-in sustaining costs by 22% since 2012. Nearly two-thirds of these savings are the result of cost and efficiency improvements. While our third quarter costs were slightly higher due to inventory changes and ongoing investment in growth, we remain on track to meet our improved 2016 outlook.","Year-to-date gold production of 3.6 million ounces is on track to meet guidance of between 4.8 million ounces and 5.0 million ounces. Key drivers for the quarter included new production at Cripple Creek & Victor, improved throughput at Boddington and KCGM, and strong performance at Carlin and Ahafo. Year-to-date, all-in sustaining costs of $910 per ounce are on track to meet guidance of between $870 per ounce and $930 per ounce.","During the third quarter, lower capital expenditures offset higher costs from inventory changes at Yanacocha and Ahafo. With higher production, lower capital, and an improved gold price, we are on track to generate strong free cash flow in 2016. We look forward to sharing our refreshed five-year outlook in the first quarter of 2017. It will reflect effective execution of our strategy and feature steady gold production as new ounces offset asset sales, costs that align with previous guidance, and our ongoing investment in core assets and projects, and capital costs that demonstrate both continuous improvement and continued growth.","Turning to slide 8, we positioned ourselves to invest in growth during the downturn and have benefited from lower competition for construction resources and equipment. As a result, we've been able to self-fund five projects that will add about 1 million ounces of gold at average all-in sustaining costs of less than $700 per ounce over the next two years. By advancing our best projects on time and at or below budget, we've also been able to achieve competitive returns. All of our projects provide internal rates of return in excess of 15%.","I'll turn now to slide 9 for a brief update on the pending sale of our stake in Batu Hijau. We expect to complete the sale during the fourth quarter and are making good progress. This includes receiving required approvals from the government of Indonesia, our buyer receiving shareholder approval for the transaction, and resolving certain tax matters pertaining to the sale. Outstanding conditions include concurrent closure of the sale of PTMDB's stake in PTNNT, a valid export license at closing, the current export permit is valid through the 22nd of November and no material adverse events.","With that, I'll turn it over to Laurie.","Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another great quarter with some exceptional financial results. I also want to thank Gary and the board and everyone at Newmont for their support over the last three years. It's been wonderful to be part of the transformation here, and I feel very confident that Newmont is in good shape and in good hands, and I look forward to watching the next chapter unfold.","Now, before I get into the reconciliation of GAAP earnings, I want to comment on the accounting treatment of PTNNT. As Gary mentioned, we've made good progress in meeting the conditions precedent for the sale. And as a result, we've met the conditions for held-for-sale accounting, and we are now treating this as a discontinued operation. That means that all P&L line items are collapsed and appear in discontinued operations. Balance sheet items are collapsed and appear as assets or liabilities held for sale. You will see this is the case for all periods included in our SEC filings as well as in the press release.","As we had indicated would happen, with this change, we did record the expected loss. So, with that, let's look at the reconciliation on this slide. GAAP earnings per share is a loss of $0.67. It includes a $577 million non-cash loss related to this reclassification of Batu Hijau as an asset held for sale. We also adjusted for our other discontinued operations and Batu Hijau earnings for the quarter of $0.13.","Net income attributable to Newmont shareholders from continuing operations is then $0.32 per share. The primary adjustments to net income were a $0.03 per share revision related to the La Quinua leach pad due to changes in expected recoveries from re-leaching pad and $0.03 per share in other minor adjustments. The net result was adjusted net income of $0.38 per share, an increase of $0.25 over the prior-year quarter.","Now, turning to slide 11, for a look at our third quarter financial performance, increased sales volume, along with higher gold price, enabled us to improve our revenue to $1.8 billion, up 15% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted net income was almost tripled compared to the prior year and adjusted EBITDA increased by 30% to $666 million. Free cash flow also improved during the quarter by 51% to $240 million, benefiting from higher gold pricing and lower CapEx.","Strong free cash flow enables the company to continue to advance our capital priorities to fund profitable growth, repay debt and return cash to our shareholders. Gary talked about the efforts to fund the growth. And yesterday and today, we announced move to act on the other priorities. This morning, we announced the $500 million debt tender, targeting our 2019 and 2022 debt towers.","Year-to-date, we've paid down $1.1 billion in debt, including $330 million on PTNNT's credit facility. With the total of $1.6 billion, this tender puts us well ahead of our goal to reduce gross debt by up to $1.3 billion by 2018. After completion of this debt tender, we will have reduced our interest expense, and our debt schedule is clearly very manageable.","Turning to net debt, we continue to target a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 1 time at $1,200 gold. As you can see on this slide, we are well below our competitors on this metric. The quarter-end net debt to EBITDA of 1.1 times is assuming the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau to create a consistent comparison as the PTNNT EBITDA is excluded given the accounting treatment.","We see potential for this metric to drop even further in the near term with the ramp-up of Merian, Long Canyon and CC&V. Reducing our net debt provides flexibility going forward and paying down gross debt reduces our interest expense. So, we focus on a balance of the two efforts.","Now, I'd like to spend a few moments on the new dividend policy on slide 13. Yesterday, we announced that the fourth quarter dividend will double based on the average gold price achieved during the third quarter, in line with our previous dividend policy. We also announced an enhanced gold price-linked dividend policy starting in the first quarter of 2017. The new policy increases the annual payout levels to provide additional upside to shareholders as gold prices increase.","In addition, because of our confidence in our ability to generate free cash flow at lower gold prices, we have also increased the payout at lower levels. At current spot pricing of $1,270 per ounce, the expected first quarter dividend would be $0.075 per share, triple the prior-year quarter dividend.","The enhanced dividend policy reflects our capital allocation priorities detailed on slide 14. On this slide, you can see the primary sources and uses of cash year-to-date and how we apply them to deliver on our capital priorities. Year-to-date cash flow from operating activities of continuing operation totaled over $1.3 billion, which we've deployed to fund profitable growth. We continue to self-fund our projects. About half of our capital expenditures to-date were used to develop projects at Merian, Long Canyon, Tanami and CC&V.","And repay debt, we've repaid nearly $800 million of corporate debt so far this year. The majority of that debt was paid early, lowering our future interest costs and highlighting our comfort level for future cash generation. And returning cash to shareholders, as I've already mentioned, our recently announced dividend was double the previous quarter and we announced the enhanced dividend policy, which will pay out at higher levels across all cycles. With that, we ended the quarter with over $2 billion in consolidated cash. The addition of the proceeds from the sale of Batu Hijau will bring that to nearly $3 billion.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about the operational results.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Laurie. We continue to deliver strong operating performance in the third quarter, most notably lowering injury rates by 12% and working without injury at Tanami and Merian, producing slightly more gold as increases at Cripple Creek & Victor, Carlin, and Boddington more than offset decline in production at Yanacocha; and maintaining capital discipline and delivering efficiency gains at our operations and projects.","Our cost performance for the quarter was impacted by some accounting charges, including a write-down on the La Quinua leach pad in Peru and inventory draw-downs in Africa; and some operational changes, including low-grade, deep transitional ores at Yanacocha and a geotechnical event at Silverstar, one of our Carlin's surface mines.","Turning to our regional performance on slide 16, as Gary mentioned, we're commissioning Phase 1 of Long Canyon. We added cyanide to the leach pad last week and we shipped carbon to Carlin for stripping and produce first gold next month. Studies to pave the way to develop Phase 2 of Long Canyon are also underway.","We've completed the Cripple Creek & Victor expansion. The mill is producing as expected and ramp-up of our new valley leach facility and recovery plant is progressing on course. And this performance keeps us on track to meet our investment case.","Finally, we're extending out Exodus portal mine to the Northwest. Work to install arrays and some ventilation equipment is underway. And this project will reach full production in 2018. The slip at the Silverstar mine in the Carlin North area will impact fourth quarter product. Fortunately, we were monitoring the wall and had evacuated people and equipment well ahead of the slip. As context, mining at Silverstar is expected to end this year. So, there is no impact to longer-term production or costs.","We're making good progress at Leeville underground, where we fine-tuned our ground control plans and developed special roof bolts designed for the prevailing conditions. We've also changed our mining methods in some areas of the mine to address this challenge. And lastly, Andrew Woodley, an experienced mining leader, would join the Newmont team on January 2 to run our North American business.","Turning to South America on slide 17, Gary and I were in Suriname two weeks ago to congratulate the team shortly after they first poured the first gold at Merian. We were pleased with how well and how safely the transition from construction to operation is going. We're keeping our options open at Yanacocha through the potential development of Cocha main (18:47) to extend oxide production. We're also advancing our sulfide studies. We have three drill rigs operating in the Chaquicocha decline and are testing autoclave recoveries at our labs here in Denver.","Finally, we're working to revise our reclamation plant for Yanacocha to update the scope, timing, cost estimates, whilst preserving optionality for future development. We'll provide an update with our fourth quarter results.","Turning to Australia on slide 18, we started full potential in Australia nearly four years ago, and the program continues to yield positive results. We delivered record throughput at Boddington and KCGM during the third quarter, and I expect this performance to continue. I'll also take this opportunity to recognize the team at KCGM, who have achieved significant improvements in safety, cost and production since Newmont took a stronger leadership position at that operation last May.","At Tanami, the dual decline is in use. Engineering, procurement and demolition for the mill expansion is complete, and construction of the new facility has begun. Our work to optimize the mine of Tanami continues, including adding ventilation to support future development, and we remain on track to finish the expansion by mid-2017.","Finally, turning to Africa on slide 19, Akyem and Ahafo continue to deliver solid performance, achieving steady improvements in mill throughput and recoveries, and Africa remains our lowest region for injuries.","Looking forward, we expect to reach a decision to fund the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika Underground projects in the fourth quarter. I'm pleased with our strong operating performance so far in 2016, but we still have opportunities for further improvement. And I look forward to bringing you up to speed on those improvements in future calls.","With that, I'll return the call to Gary on slide 20.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Tom. Our project pipeline, which I believe is the best in the gold sector, gives us the flexibility and optionality we need to grow margins while maintaining steady production levels. This version of our pipeline shows a timeframe for delivering projects into production, all the way out to our greenfield exploration prospects on the far left. Earlier-stage projects represent additional upside to our production and cost guidance and the next cabs off the rank are the Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika Underground mine in Ghana.","Turning to slide 21. The Ahafo Mill Expansion is designed to leverage existing infrastructure to build capacity and improve costs, would also offset lower-grade ore and accelerate profitable production from stockpiles. The Subika Underground mine will produce ore grades that are three times higher than the current surface mine grades, and create a platform to explore the region's significant underground potential. As Tom mentioned, we expect to reach decisions on both projects in the fourth quarter. If approved, they would add between 225,000 ounces and 300,000 ounces of gold annually with first production in 2018, and lower Newmont's all-in sustaining costs. Ahafo is a great example of our success in extending mine life and reserves through exploration.","Turning to slide 22. Our team has added 123 million ounces of gold reserves by the drill bit over the last 15 years. Exploration remains a core competency and the most cost-effective way to add high-quality ounces to our reserve base. In fact, about 60% of the gold we'll mine this year was discovered by Newmont geologists.","Recent success stories include Long Canyon, where we've increased reserves and measured and indicated resources by more than 50% since we began reporting reserves in 2013; at Merian, where we've grown the base by more than 165% to about 4.5 million ounces since 2010; at Tanami, where we've expanded our base by 200% since 2003, and confirmed the potential to double it again by expanding existing deposits and developing adjacent discoveries; and finally, at Ahafo, where we've more than doubled our base since 2003. What you're not seeing here are inferred resources or inventory, which require more definition before they're considered viable.","Turning to our market outlook on slide 23, low or even negative real interest rates are making gold an increasingly attractive investment and gold exchange traded fund holdings have increased by 18 million ounces or nearly 40% since the beginning of the year. In the medium term, we expect prices to rise on improved fundamentals. On the supply side, three-year average gold discoveries have dropped by more than 75% between 2007 and 2012. And mine supply is expected to decrease by about 6% from 2015 to 2020 due to aging ore bodies and slower project development. On the demand side, we expect a rising middle class in China and India to drive steady growth. Taken together, the two countries represent more than 50% of current consumer gold demand. Despite these positive signs our strategy remains the same.","Turning to slide 24. We've built a solid foundation over the last three-and-a-half years and our work to improve our performance, portfolio and balance sheet continues. Though we're not relying on rising gold prices or resting on our achievements, our goal is to be the world's most profitable and responsible gold business. And you can count on us to continue raising our game by delivering world-class safety, sustainability and technical performance, continuing to optimize our operations and our portfolio, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and leveraging it to grow value, repay debt and return cash to shareholders.","Thank you for your time. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question on the queue comes from the line of Mr. Andrew Quail of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. You may begin.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Morning, Gary, Laurie and team. First off, Laurie, thank you very much for your help over the last few years. It's been excellent working with you, and all the best for the future and in retirement. I've a question on \u2013 my first question is on Ahafo. Obviously, we saw a jump in cash cost and, obviously, the all-in sustaining cash cost. What drove that? I know you said there's inventory or negative inventory adjustment. Can you guys just elaborate and what you expect going forward at that operation?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. Thanks, Andrew. Thanks for your comments. At Ahafo, we're into a point where we're going to start to draw down on the stockpile. From a cash flow standpoint, that's a very positive because we have less tied up on the balance sheet. But those are generally going to be higher cost ounces than what we're mining today. So, you'll see a bit of a negative P&L impact on it, but we're also focused on (26:40) cash. So, it's a positive on the cash side.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is that something that goes on for a couple of quarters or is that like an annual thing?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think you're going to see that going into next year; that will come through in full detail with the 2017 guidance. But as we wait for the Ahafo Mill and Subika Underground, I think you're going to see that continue for a bit.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I mean \u2013 I'm sorry, the next question is on Merian. Now, you guys obviously \u2013 you're up to commercial production. Can you guys just discuss what the upside is there sort of on a longer-term view, sort of three or five-year view on \u2013 and specially with something like how much exploration spend you guys are going to allocate to this site?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think a couple of things, Andrew. First of all, I think there's potential upside in mill throughput. As we get things ramped up, we'll have a better idea on what the actual potential of the mill is, but we see that as a potential upside. We're not building that in, in our current guidance as we look into 2017, because I'd like to give them a few months of actual experience to see before we try to build that up. But I see that as one upside. I think exploration, and as I alluded to in my comments, it's still open in all directions there. We continue to see good results. Whether it's an underground potential deposit or actually an expansion of the current open pit, the results we see could lead to just a bigger open pit there, which \u2013 with much higher grades than what the current ore body average is. And that shows up \u2013 I don't think we've got it in this slide pack. But in the last quarter slides, we had some cross sections that showed some of that drilling below the pit.","So, I'm very encouraged there, and we continue to look. Sabajo is in the region. It's about 30, 35 kilometers away, and that's an additional deposit. What's good about that is it's the saprolite softer ore. So, it would be good in terms of improving and continuing the throughput characteristics at Merian. So, overall, still very pleased with the potential there. Of course, none of that's been built into our current guidance.","Andrew Quail - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question on queue is coming from the line of David Haughton of CIBC. Your line is open. You may begin.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Gary and Tom, and good luck for the future, Laurie. I've got a question on Merian. So, early days, I know, but you've been mining there for a while. I was just wondering how the ore is behaving. Is it reconciling to your block model expectations? Is it going through the mill as expected? The slide that you'd shown as a backdrop there of the stockpile looked like it was really soft ore. So, I wonder if you could just talk to some of those items, please.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. I think in terms of reconciliation, we're probably reconciling with a bit higher tonnes than what was expected. And that's not unusual as you're at the upper parts of the ore body, on the fringes to have found that. But as we get in, grade is reconciling very close to what we expected. As you may recall, when we announced the project, I talked about the fact we did an additional roughly $25 million worth of drilling to understand that ore body. So, I'm not surprised that it's coming in, but that's coming in well.","I think in terms of the ore quality, yes, and that's the nature of saprolite, it's soft. We've kind of duplicated how Rosebel handled that material in terms of using bulldozers and the backhoe to help feed into the mill, and that process is going well. I think early on here, for the first several months, as we're in that very surface part of the ore body, we encounter \u2013 actually, you're right, at the surface, where you've got roots and things from plant materials.","So, some of that's come through. But I think the team's worked through a method for handling that. That's been probably the only thing they've had to manage with, that I wouldn't say was a surprise, but just it adds some complexity to the startup. But I think the startup and ramp-up's been going very well and all according to plan.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Excellent. Just switching over to Long Canyon coming on stream by year-end it looks like. I'm wondering if at this stage you could give us an idea how the CapEx is going. So, ahead of time, is it looking like it's within your budget or better?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. I think, at this stage, Long Canyon, we haven't updated. I'd like to get it up to the commercial production point, and then at that point, we'll update our guidance on the capital. But it's going very well.","David Haughton - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much, Gary.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from Andrew Kaip of BMO. Your line is open. You may begin.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi, Gary and Laurie. Congratulations on a good quarter. David hit the, or got to, my questions first on Long Canyon and just the CapEx. I'm wondering how you're tracking in that regard.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Okay. Well, I think the same as what we just told David, we're tracking \u2013 we'll give an update when we achieve first commercial production, but we're tracking very well against what we expected.","Andrew Kaip - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next question on queue is coming from the line of Tanya Jakusconek of Scotia Bank. Your line is open. You may begin.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Good morning, everybody. And Laurie, congratulations on your future board work. Questions on \u2013 some technical questions, if I may. Just coming to Merian, Gary, seeing things have started off well, why then the 20,000 ounces downward revision to guidance for that asset for this year? I mean, I know I'm splitting hair, but maybe there's something with the plants or the routes that had to make adjustments. I'm just trying to understand what changed your guidance.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","I'm going to hand over for Tom to give an update on that one.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Gary, and good morning, Tanya. We commissioned the facility exactly as we planned to this year. What we'd assumed in our plan which goes to those 20,000 ounces is we thought as we're building gold inventory in circuit that before we declared commercial production, we would pull off around 20,000 ounces. As it turned out, commissioning went very smoothly, but we didn't drop first ounces out of the circuit until essentially the 1st of October. So, just the way the commissioning went, that 20,000 ounces didn't present in the pre-commissioning, so we started first gold from the 1st of October. So, a slight offset as we move into the remaining part of this year, around the 100,000 ounces rather than the 120,000 ounces.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","It's really a matching production to sales piece...","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","To sales, okay.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","...because of the sales timing.","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. There's gold in the circuit.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Okay. No, that's fine. I just wanted to know, because it didn't seem with everything else, your tonnage on your grade on the block models seemed to be reconciling. So, I was just trying to understand what happened. Okay. So, that's helpful. And maybe if I can continue still on the technical side, just on the geotechnical issues in Nevada, I know it's something that you mentioned for Q4, we'll see a bit weaker. What is weaker? What will we lose from these geotechnical issues?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","You'll see our guidance for Carlin for production, we're dropping from, I think, a range of 1,040 ounces to 1,100 ounces down to 970 ounces to 1,030 ounces. So, that's the impact of those geotechnical issues. With the slip at Silverstar, we're monitoring that. We're right near the end of mining that pit. We understood that fault. We're monitoring that area. We'd stepped out to just add a bit of protection and then the slip slowly came down. As I said in my notes, we had people and equipment well clear of that area. So, that's the main driver of the impact on the revised production guidance for Carlin for this year. Some of those ounces will push into 2017, so we were expected to be out of that mine at the end of this year. As a result of this issue, we push into the first part of the first quarter and some of those ounces will move across into next year.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","What do you think would move across? Is it half of them or what would be a guesstimate?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think half would be a reasonable estimate.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then maybe just on Boddington, obviously, a great throughput in the quarter. Maybe just what's happening there, at that operation?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","I think what you're seeing at Boddington, four years of full potential work, excellent leadership from Alex Bates and the team there at Boddington. That mill is really hitting its straps. All the work we've done over several years, that team is driving that mill to record performance. We've had record months. We've had record weeks. And it's really the fruition of a lot of hard work to improve the availability and the reliability of that facility down at Boddington.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","And you think that's sustainable?","Tom Palmer - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yes. Yeah. This is the result of a lot of a hard work, a very capable leadership team, and I fully expect that performance to continue and to look to improve.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Well, that's good. And maybe one for you, Gary. I know we talked about Batu Hijau, hopefully, the completion of the sale very soon. And I was writing viciously some of the things that are still left to outstanding. Can you just review again what exactly are we waiting for to just complete this? Like, what have we done and what are we waiting for? Sorry, I just missed that. Yeah.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Yeah. The number of the conditions precedent have been met in terms of different approval of the buyer shareholders, for instance, the resolution of certain tax issues and government approvals. And I was over there last month with Randy. We had an opportunity to meet with the team on the ground in Batu Hijau and in Jakarta to thank them for all their work through the transition and all the work they've done, especially through some of the challenging last three years as we've had to work through the changed approach to getting export permits. Also, I had the opportunity to meet with government officials in that process as well to thank them for their support.","In terms of the key outstanding item remaining is actually getting the concurrent sale or the sale of one of the partners. Basically, the Bakrie's MDB, and having that sale go through. There's elements of that we're not in control of, it's stuff that they need to work through as they go through that process as that comes to a conclusion. That's really the key main item that's left outstanding.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, the rest of the other ones you've mentioned you pretty much have that in place. Obviously, the export permit you said that sometime in November it expires and you're looking to have that one renewed.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","That's correct. We've submitted our application there.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. We look forward to closing it and getting the monies. Thank you very much.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","So do we. Thank you, Tanya.","Tanya Jakusconek - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. The next question on queue coming from the line of Anita Soni of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. You may begin.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","That's okay. Tanya asked this question, which was with regards to the production at Merian, so I will take it offline now. Thanks.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Anita. I know you guys have a busy day today with lots of earnings coming out.","Anita Soni - Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc","Indeed. Thanks.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. The next question on the queue coming from the line of Chris Terry of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. You may begin.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Hi, guys. Yeah. Two questions from me. Just on slide 20 where you've got the project pipeline laid out. In terms of the pre-feasibility study projects in the middle, can you just give a quick rundown on the timing that we should expect for some of those projects, please?","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Sure. I'll run through. They all vary, as you can imagine, based on their complexity. Yanacocha sulfides at the top is about a two-year process to work that through pre-feas and on into definitive feasibility. Awonsu and Apensu Deeps are really underground extensions around Ahafo. And that's really primarily a combination of drilling and how things work. That's probably a more of the two to three years sort of a timeframe. Ahafo North is more in the three-year timeframe as we work through the next stages for that project.","Tanami Expansion 2, I would see in that same sort of two- to three-year timeframe. So that \u2013 well, three \u2013 it says below three to five years at the bottom. And then, Federation, the same thing. It's really getting the expansion \u2013 Tanami Expansion 2, by the way, is a shaft, is what we're looking at for production there because the deposit extends so much at depth. So, hopefully, it gives you an idea. And that was the idea of putting the years at the bottom. Three to five is a general kind of a rule, but they all vary a little bit around there.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Thanks. Thanks, Gary. I was just wondering whether we should expect any of those a bit sooner. And then, just a question to Laurie on Batu closing. I'm sorry if you've been through this before, but the $920 million gross proceeds, can you just give an update on how the amount that you'll actually receive to Newmont post closeout of any internal debt in Indonesia actually flows through to you and how that might vary depending on the exact closure date of the deal?","Mary Lauren Brlas - Newmont Mining Corp.","The debt is all paid off, so there's no debt coming. That's something that we handled already. So, that will not affect it. There are some deposits that the buyers already made. So, that has an impact on it. And then, we'll also \u2013 well, from an accounting standpoint, we'll note any cost of it. But for the most part, you're going to get most of that money just coming directly through the $875 million that was on the slide is what we expect to come through.","Christopher Terry - Deutsche Bank AG (Australia)","Okay. Thanks, Laurie.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And at this time, we have no question on queue. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Gary Goldberg.","Gary J. Goldberg - Newmont Mining Corp.","Thank you, and thank you all for joining the call this morning. I know you've got lots of activity going on in the space. The Newmont team delivered another strong quarter and our work to raise our performance to the next level continues. We're also pleased to share good news, which includes appointing experienced finance leader, Nancy Buese, to the role of Executive Vice President and CFO, effective October 31; announcing higher dividends in the fourth quarter and an enhanced dividend policy for 2017, and a $500 million debt tender; delivering Merian into commercial production safely, on schedule and more than $150 million under budget.","Thank you again for your time and have a safe day.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And that will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
