Please go ahead.","James Abbott","Good evening, and thank you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2014 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Scott McLean, President; and Michael Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. ","A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your question to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. ","Harris Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and welcome to the call today. We\u2019ve taken a number of actions to reduce risk in our balance sheet over the past several years, including several significant actions taken during the third quarter, which I\u2019ll mention in a moment.","As is noted in our release, we also issued $525 million of common equity in the third quarter, in response to the CCAR process, and that, in combination with our retained earnings, has resulted in our tier one common equity rising to nearly 12%, from 10.5% last quarter.","The allowance for credit losses, really another form of capital, equaled 1.7% of loans, which is still stronger than most of our peers, despite having one of the lowest loan loss rates in recent quarters. ","In addition to increasing our common equity, we\u2019ve significantly reduced the debt carried of the balance sheet. Since 2018, debt has averaged approximately $4.4 billion, which is equal to about 100% of tier one common equity for the same period.","This quarter, we reduced debt to $1.3 billion, or just 24% tier one common at September 30. As noted in the press release, the reduction of debt in the third quarter will reduce interest expense by more than $50 million annually.","With respect to credit risk, Zions\u2019 net loan losses have been among the best of the large U.S. commercial banks for several quarters now, and nonperforming assets continue to fall. They\u2019re now just 0.8% of loans in real estate owned. I expect that this improvement will likely place Zions in the top quartile of nonperforming asset ratios among our peers, once all of the banks have reported.","Not particularly visible to most of you on the call, but of equal importance, we have significantly upgraded our risk and credit management practices, and will continue to make further refinements over time. ","The examples include maintaining underwriting standards at very strong levels, despite some competitors that are granting credit at greater levels of leverage. We\u2019ve been maintaining robust standards of so-called phantom interest rates, which are interest rates that we use in the underwriting process to stress the cash flows of a borrower to determine how well the business will be able to service the debt if and when interest rates rise.","During the past several years, we have substantially upgraded our credit rating process and reviews. We\u2019ve enhanced credit monitoring, we\u2019ve greatly enhanced our concentration risk management, and of course introduced stress testing and refined that process several times.","As a result, we\u2019ve tightened the belt on some kinds of loans that exhibit high losses under actual and modeled stress. We\u2019ve further reduced our exposure to CDOs and construction and land development loans, primarily through increased syndications and participations.","At the end of 2009, construction and land development loans, plus CDOs equaled $8.3 billion, or about 240% of our tier one common equity. Today, such assets equal only about $3 billion or about 56% of tier one common.","We expect to continue to be very active construction and development lenders, but we\u2019re going to continue to actively use syndications and participations to control the volumes of these types of credits we carry on our own balance sheet, that are subject to stress testing.","With respect to noninterest expenses, the headline number requires some adjustment to get to a number that would be more consistent with our ongoing operations. We\u2019ve noted some of those items in the press release, and Doyle will elaborate further in his remarks, but I would characterize the operational portion of expenses as being in line with our historical outlook, for about $1.6 billion annually for a little while.","Recall we are significantly overhauling many of our information technology and accounting systems, much of which is expensed as it occurs. While these initiatives haven\u2019t expensed today, they\u2019re necessary to remain competitive, and we believe we will be able to become significantly more efficient as a result of the changes we are making.","I want to assure you that we are very focused on expense control. Staffing has declined at the affiliate banks, but regulatory related costs continue to increase, in addition to the technology initiatives and their related costs. ","Our outlook for noninterest expenses remains unchanged, at approximately $1.6 billion or about $400 million to $405 million per quarter on average throughout 2015.","With that overview, I\u2019ll now ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle? ","Doyle Arnold","","Thanks, Harris. Good evening everyone. Let me first note that I\u2019m toward the tail end of a very persistent cold, and the most persistent part of it is an occasional cough, so I apologize in advance, and I may ask James to stand by to pinch hit if things get out of control, but hopefully not.","So for the third quarter of 2014, we posted net earnings to common shareholders of $79 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share, as noted in the press release. This compares to earnings applicable to common of $104 million or $0.56 per diluted common share for the second quarter.","We\u2019ve highlighted for you in the release a few of the larger items that caused noise in the results, I think all of which we\u2019ve talked about, and some of which we\u2019ve previously quantified for you. First of all, there was the expense related to debt extinguishment from the successful tender for $500 million of senior debt in September. That hurt earnings by about $0.14 per share.","We sold additional CDO securities during the quarter at a small loss. The net impact was about $0.06 per share. Somewhat offsetting those were the negative provisions for credit losses, both the on balance sheet loans and the unfunded commitment reserve, which together totaled about $0.22 per share. Similar adjustments for prior periods are detailed in the release and in our 10Qs. ","Harris already highlighted several of the key risk reduction actions that we took during the quarter, and many of you watched the press releases throughout the quarter regarding our equity issuance, debt extinguishment, and with this release, you can see the details about some other risk-reducing actions that also were taken.","Commercial construction loan commitments have declined by more than $700 million, as compared to commitments at the time of our CCAR resubmission, which used a balance sheet date of December 31, 2013.","Subsequent to the reduction, we\u2019ve also tightened somewhat our concentration limits for on balance sheet lending to constrain C&D growth on our balance sheet for stress testing purposes. As Harris noted, we\u2019re not exiting the business of construction lending. In fact, we expect to remain very active. However, we also expect to continue to use more syndication and participation arrangements to limit the on balance sheet exposure that is subject to stress testing.","CDOs also declined materially as a result of both sales, primarily, but also paydowns at par. And we expect to continue to manage this portfolio down as long as market conditions remain conducive. There may be additional sales in the fourth quarter, in fact, again, depending upon market conditions.","We\u2019re entering CCAR 2015 with capital ratios that are significantly higher than at December 31. As Harris already mentioned, the tier one common ratio is 17% higher, or 1.7 percentage points. And also, by extinguishing $835 million of debt, we\u2019ve reduced the risk of being unable to roll debt in the extreme meltdown or if it were rolled, the spreads on that debt, we\u2019ve eliminated the risk of them widening to extreme levels, as might be modeled under a stress test environment.","Regardless of that, the debt reduction alone should improve pre-provision net revenue by at least $120 million over a nine-quarter planning scenario. And as you know, our PP&R, as projected under the Fed\u2019s stress test result was unusually low compared to peer institutions.","With regard to noninterest expense, I\u2019ll make a few more comments. On page nine of the release, salaries and benefits increased by about $7 million this quarter. Much of the increase is attributable to further buildout of staffing needed for the technology replacement and enhancement projects. Many of those people were hired in June, so the third quarter number represents a full quarter of that expense.","Additionally, as detailed in the release, we booked severance expense attributable to the consolidation of some loan operation centers that we expect to occur in the second half of next year. Those severance expenses totaled $5 million this quarter compared to a million dollars in the prior quarter. ","Why book it so soon? The accounting rules require, as some of you know, that if you have an identified plan and you\u2019ve identified the people, etc., and met certain criteria, you have to go ahead and book that expense, even though the benefit may not be realized until sometime in the future. And we crossed that threshold with a very specific plan, and people have actually been notified and retention arrangements have been put in place related to those loan operations consolidations. ","Also, there was an extra business day in the quarter that increased salary expenses by $4 million compared to the prior quarter, but that expense was offset on the bottom line by the additional revenue that also was derived from that additional day.","Professional and legal expenses increased almost entirely due to outside consultants working on the technology projects, the stress testing, and the replacement of the chart of accounts and financial reporting systems. ","That latter\u2019s probably in its peak spending phase now, through year-end, and then should start to taper off next year. And as you know, these technology projects are very key components of our efforts to, over the long term, control and reduce expenses. ","The other major movement occurred in the provision for unfunded lending commitments. Most of the decline is attributable to a decline in unfunded commitments of loans that are in relatively higher historical loss categories, such as construction, which commitment level I described earlier. And that concludes that thought.","It\u2019s difficult to forecast that line with any reasonable degree of accuracy, but we would generally expect it to be slightly positive over time, due primarily to growth in commitments. As Harris indicated, we\u2019ve indicated that we\u2019re attempting to keep overall noninterest expense levels flat during this process. We expect salary levels and some professional services to increase, largely offset by a decline in the indemnification assets related to the FDIC supported loans from the acquisition in 2009 and the decline in other credit related costs.","I\u2019ll now move on to a review of some of the key revenue drivers, first turning to loans. Average loans held for investment were essentially stable compared to the prior quarter. Most of the loan growth occurred in the last part of the quarter, including residential loans purchased and construction loan participation sold.","Many of you are aware of our intraquarter update, where we indicated the period in loans could be down, and that we expected average loans to be essentially flat to maybe slightly positive. Period end loans held for investment actually increased $110 million. That was the net of a lot of different moving parts, some of it organic and some of it related to increased participations sold and a portfolio of high quality jumbo arms purchased.","C&I loans had a softer quarter, primarily impacted by some larger loans being paid down or paid off, some of which was driven by merger activity, and also competition from the capital markets as some companies issued notes to replace bank debt.","Trying to loan production volume, that was approximately flat from a year ago. New loan pricing has been fairly stable in most categories. A shift in mix this quarter, the decline in construction lending more than offset by a strong increase in residential mortgage due to the purchase loans described did temporarily depress the coupon on new production this quarter by about 6 basis points to 3.71%.","We don\u2019t expect this relatively residential heavy mix of production to persist going forward. That was driven by some specific actions on our part. On page 14 of the release, the GAAP yield on the portfolio, excluding FDIC supported loans, declined 4 basis points to approximately 4.24%. ","The coupon on new production remains below the weighted average coupon rate of the portfolio, and therefore we expect additional modest compression of loan portfolio yield for the next several quarters. ","Net investment income we\u2019ll note was $417 million, on page nine, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter. We are encouraged with the third quarter stability of the headline net interest income. While it would be ideal to report positive sequential growth in net interest income, you may recall that we\u2019ve been deriving a significant benefit to net interest income from the loans purchased from the FDIC, again back in 2009.","And that income source is now coming to its end. Just compared to the prior quarter, we experienced a $5 million decline in interest income from that source. If we exclude that effect on net interest income, NII has increased an annualized $47 million or about 3% compared to the same period a year ago. ","Although we ceased providing core net interest income, we did commit to giving you the components, so that you could continue to calculate it, and we\u2019ll do so for the remainder of the year, and then I think they\u2019ll be small enough that we\u2019ll probably stop doing that.","So the additional accretion on FDIC supported loans is found on the table at the bottom of page nine. It equals $7.7 million. And the discount amortization on subordinated debt was $4.9 million. Adjusting for these factors, there was about a $3 million linked quarter increase of net interest income, which is explained by the increase in the number of days in the quarter. ","The net interest margin declined 9 basis points compared to the prior quarter to 3.2%. About 5 basis points of the decline was due to the increase in average money market investments, which increased nearly $1 billion sequentially. That was driven by several things, including the over half billion capital issuance and other actions that we took to build cash in order to pay down debt, which we did later in the quarter. We had the large tender offer and other payoffs of debt, which you can see on the balance sheet.","So the cash balance fell considerably at the end of the quarter, which should add support to the NIM in the fourth quarter. The remaining 4 basis points of compression can be ascribed to the decline in income from the FDIC supported loans.","As you know, we generally avoid giving outlook on the NIM, but it is worth noting that the debt extinguishment should add about 10 basis points to the NIM in the fourth quarter, before accounting for other factors.","Brief comment on fee income. We do recognize that we have a proportionately low amount of fee income relative to the other large regional U.S. banks. We\u2019re actively working to narrow that gap, primarily through organic growth initiatives. The results from the third quarter are encouraging, and we\u2019re optimistic about our continued ability to grow that revenue over time.","I\u2019ll kind of wrap up the opening here with some comments on the outlook. And again, these outlook comments are for the forward four quarters, relative to the quarter just ended. For loan growth, we\u2019re maintaining our slight to moderate loan growth outlook over the one-year time horizon. ","For net interest income, on a GAAP basis, including the effect of an expected decline in interest income from the FDIC supported loans, we expect net interest income to increase slightly. The primary benefit will come from the debt extinguishment, which will add about $13 million prior quarter for the next several quarters, and there will be additional benefits late in 2015 as the remaining high cost subordinated debt matures and will be retired.","Further declines in FDIC supported loan interest income will pressure the net interest income as will maturing loans that are replaced at lower yields, but again, adding all that together, we think net interest income will increase slightly.","Regarding noninterest income, we expect core components of noninterest income, such as service fees, to continue a modest upward trend as we continue to press organic growth and fee income.","Regarding noninterest expense, the outlook remains unchanged at approximately $1.6 billion annually or $400 million to $405 million prior quarter, on average for the next several quarters. Somewhat offsetting the expense increases related to the systems initiative should be continued reduction of FDIC indemnification asset expense amortization.","Variables such as provision for unfunded lending commitments and legal expenses are difficult to forecast, and we generally would not expect additional transactions that would cause the provision for unfunded lending commitments to be as significantly negative as it was this third quarter.","Regarding provision expense, given our expectation of continued improvements in the credit metrics that drive the ALLL methodology, we expect provision expense to remain modestly negative in the near term, although any reserve releases in this and future quarters are expected to be significantly smaller than those in the second and third quarters of this year.","We\u2019re closely watching the recent turmoil in capital markets and abroad. While we do not see anything that would cause the quantitative portion of our models to reverse course, we note that the rate of reserve release from the qualitative portion could slow down, depending on what we see in the external environment. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator to open up the line for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. ","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","I guess I was curious a little bit about the purchase of the jumbo loans this quarter and just kind of some of the motivations behind that and the type of institution you bought them from. And it sounds like growth won\u2019t be as residential heavy going forward, but should we be expecting any purchase activity going forward?","Doyle Arnold","First of all, I\u2019ll note that the loans were very high quality jumbo ARMs in our western footprint. The preponderance of them were in California, but there were others that were scattered around all our other states. None of them was out of footprint. They were purchased from another banking institution, and the motivation predominantly was to balance off the reduction in earning assets that came from our focused attempt to reduce commercial C&D commitments and outstandings. ","And by the way, what we participated out was also high quality, but fares less well under stress testing. So it was an attempt to rebalance the risk profile of the portfolio without materially impacting current and future earnings, and we think we accomplished that. ","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets ","And then just a question on the C&I portfolio. There was some growth this quarter, but as I recall, maybe in one of your intraquarter updates, you talked about possibly seeing some outsized paydowns and maybe pulling back in the energy area. So just wondered if you could talk about just trends in the C&I portfolio in general, and perhaps any change in utilization rates as well.","Doyle Arnold ","I\u2019m going to let James start with that one.","James Abbot","Basically, I would characterize it as we had a mixed quarter from some of the banks. Typically, Amegy, for example, has a very strong C&I quarter on a very regular basis, but Amegy did experience some paydowns this quarter due to some companies that were either issued debt in the public markets and replaced bank debt, or sold the companies outright and so forth. So that was one of the sources of pressure. ","Zions Bank in Utah had really strong growth in C&I, actually. About $117 million. So you really had kind of mixed results from the various different banks.","On the owner occupied side, which includes some of the small business lending, it was just a soft quarter in general, and a lot of that was driven by Zions Bank continuing. As you know, they have the national real estate group, and that continues to run down, primarily due to supply. Just a lack of supply coming from that particular market right now, with liquidity being as robust as it is across the industry.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets ","And any change in utilization rates that you could pick up at all?","James Abbott","No change in utilization rates. I believe it\u2019s 33%, which is unchanged from the prior quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ","Maybe just start off, in terms of the construction portfolio, obviously big reduction this quarter. But now that you\u2019re past the CCAR client information date, I guess, the September 30 date, I know you said you still wanted to be active in construction, but you also said you wanted to not hold a lot of construction. Like, where do we go from here? Do we see absolute reductions in construction over the next several quarters? Or do you feel that you have a little leeway where you don\u2019t need to do that?","Doyle Arnold ","I don\u2019t foresee major reductions from here, but neither should you expect to see major growth in the on balance sheet portion, certainly not until we get another CCAR result and see just how this portfolio does fare. ","But I do believe that, as I said in my remarks, and I think Harris as well, this is a business that we think we do very well, we certainly want to remain active in, and even grow from the standpoint of client relationships, etc. But in a stress test world, the growth has to be more of an originate and syndicate, originate participate a portion of it model. We can\u2019t keep as much of it on our balance sheet as we maybe historically have. ","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ","And then my second question, in terms of the qualitative reserve, I think you said that was kind of slow in terms of its release. Can you just quantify some of that? How much do you feel that you have that\u2019s excess qualitative reserves? And how much was actually released this quarter? ","Doyle Arnold ","The answer to your first question is zero. If I thought I had excess, I would have released more, by definition. The answer to the second is I\u2019m not sure the exact number, but I think the majority of the release was driven by credit quality metric improvements and the volume of loans. And the third contributor might have been some adjustment in the qualitatives.","Harris Simmons ","It was about a 60-40 split, Ken, about 60% of the reserve release was quantitative and 40% was the qualitative portion of the release, which is actually not that different from the composition of the reserve overall.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. ","John Pancari - Evercore","Question on the loan growth. So it sounds like you\u2019re not going to be buying anymore production or ramping up purchases in resi mortgages from here. Can you talk to us about total loan growth, because you just implied that construction should be somewhat muted, although not declining incrementally, so how should we think about total loan growth balances, all that being said, in the coming quarters.","Doyle Arnold ","Well, very crudely put, on page ten, if you look at the numbers there, construction and land development declined by $450 million, and one to four family increased by $300 million, but $100 million of that was our own production. ","So if you zero out the C&D shrinkage and zero out the purchase, you basically are adding about $200 million to this quarter\u2019s loan growth, and your back end of the $300 million or $400 million a quarter that I think is consistent with our guidance of whatever we\u2019ve been saying, moderate? You know, add that up over the course of a year and you\u2019re somewhere in a $1.5 billion range? ","This was a one-time, at least that\u2019s the way we\u2019re conceiving of it now, rebalancing of the on balance sheet portfolio.","John Pancari - Evercore ","Right. So the need to replace the runoff in C&D with the purchase, like you did this quarter, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re going to have that need next quarter? Because the majority of the C&D runoff has occurred?","Doyle Arnold ","Well, it wasn\u2019t runoff, it was actual participations and syndications sold, with some conversion to term, which goes on all the time. But trying to actually bring the totals down materially by increased participations was a one-time thing. Using participations to keep it from growing back, rapidly, if you will, is something that we\u2019ll do, but we\u2019re not at the present time trying to further shrink the on balance sheet part of C&D.","John Pancari - Evercore ","And then my last one, kind of back to Ken\u2019s question, on the reserve, with it sitting here around 154 basis points currently, what would you view as a good bottom longer term with your reserve ratio, just given what you\u2019re seeing right now on your credit front?","Doyle Arnold ","That\u2019s a question I\u2019m just not going to answer. I have to follow GAAP, and it will be what it will be. But there\u2019s nothing on the credit quality metric outlook that causes me to think that that reserve coverage ratio, whichever one you want to look at, has to go back up. And aim, the pressures are for slight further reductions, at least in the next quarter or two. At some point, it has to end, but I don\u2019t know when.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank ","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","I was just wondering if you had any updated thoughts on where you stand on the LCR, and how much excess liquidity you guys think you have right now that you can reduce over time?","Doyle Arnold ","On a consolidated basis, we think we pass the LCR on a fully phased in basis, with a little bit of room to spare. And some banks, we have a lot of excess liquidity. At others, we\u2019re probably a little short. So there, over time, needs to be some rebalancing there. I think rather than give you a precise number, with the kind of loan growth that I described, I don\u2019t see the LCRs being a material constraint on loan growth in the near to medium term. But there\u2019s no question but what we and everybody else are going to be managing permanently to a larger cash and HQLA high quality liquid asset kind of securities portfolio than we might have been historically. ","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank ","And then how much cash do you guys have at the parent at this point?","Doyle Arnold ","A lot [laughter]. I think over $900 million.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank ","And any other thoughts about paying down borrowings or anything like that?","Doyle Arnold ","Yes, we\u2019re looking at the appropriate use of that cash and certainly some of it, as I mentioned, we have some very expensive subdebt maturing in the first quarter of next year, which we\u2019ll certainly want to pay off. When I say very expensive, it has an effective GAAP interest expense cost of over 20%. It\u2019s the last of the modified subdebt. ","But beyond that, I think we\u2019ll wait for the CCAR resubmission and capital plan to come together and then tell you what, if anything, we\u2019re going to do with some of that cash. There are a number of potential ways to use that to benefit the shareholders. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets ","We have just one question. You mentioned that you were executing on organic growth initiatives. Would you be able to outline some of those?","Doyle Arnold ","Well, that was specifically with regard to fee income. I believe we have commented on them a number of times. There\u2019s nothing really new. Harris, do you want to talk about that? Or turn it over to Scott McLean?","Harris Simmons ","We\u2019re seeing good growth in commercial cards. We\u2019re seeing revenue increasing there at a pretty good clip. We continue to see growth in our treasury management income. Mortgage banking is something we\u2019re focused on doing more of, but it\u2019s obviously a tough market to be actually gaining traction in. But we expect that through the cycle we\u2019ll be doing more of that. And wealth management has been another area of focus for us. ","So those are some of the really primary areas. I think that probably one of the risks on the horizon for anybody who\u2019s really heavily consumer oriented is going to be overdraft income, and so we\u2019re not trying to push that pedal any further. We think that that\u2019s probably not going to be a growth area. Service charges on deposit accounts generally is not going to see a lot of growth, but some of these other areas, we think there\u2019s some good growth potential in them. ","Scott McLean","Doyle, this is Scott. I would think Harris summarized it well. I would just add to that that we\u2019re seeing the benefit of much stronger product development at the corporate level, and then these products being delivered locally. ","Treasury management, which represents about 30% of our fee income, is a good example of that. Credit card represents about 20% of our fee income, and it is a really good example of that too, where the product is being developed much more effective centrally, and then coordinating the delivery at the local level. Mortgage, we\u2019re going through that today, and we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for a community bank model like us to have really good, strong mortgage fee income potential. ","Doyle Arnold ","For those of you who don\u2019t recognize it, that last voice was that of Scott McLean, who was CEO of Amegy Bank, and we drafted Scott early this year to become president of Zions Bancorp. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. ","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","A bit of a bigger picture question. How do you think about the pros and cons of running the structure with the multiple subsidiaries and banking charters? And what could prompt you to reexamine that?","Harris Simmons ","Well, I guess I\u2019d say that we see a lot of pros given our mix of business, which is very heavily oriented toward small to middle market kinds of businesses. And it\u2019s a really good model of relationship management. The need and the opportunity is really to figure out how we get more cost out of this, particularly with what we deliver centrally, and we\u2019re very focused on that. ","That\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re investing in some of these technology projects that will allow us to take some additional cost out and operate a lot of the back office much more consistently across the enterprise. But it is something that we continue to study and be very focused on how we do this in a way that preserves the best of what we think this model delivers in the way of\u2026 And what we\u2019re trying to do locally, but gets us more cost savings. There\u2019s still opportunity on the cost side, I think for sure. ","I\u2019ve noted to some folks recently that\u2026 I mean, one measure of how composition of our balance sheet differs from others is if you look at small business loans, it\u2019s a big part of what we do. If you look at the total loans, from $100,000 to $1 million in size\u2026 I\u2019d go up further than that, but that\u2019s the limit of a call report and what it captures in the way of small business lending. ","But using that as a proxy, we make 50% as much of that kind of credit available to clients across our footprint as JPMorgan Chase does across the United States of America. And for that kind of business, we actually think that having this very community bank like structure has been a great help, in helping us to gain market share and up into the middle market kinds of companies that we serve in a lot of these markets. ","We\u2019ve got really good reputational kind of scores, in local surveys, etc. But we know that that has to be accompanied by a cost structure that works, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. ","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research ","And what sorts of timelines should we be thinking about for seeing these expense benefits?","Harris Simmons ","As I\u2019ve articulated, on a number of occasions with investors, we have several major projects, each of which will ramp its peak spend, and then begin to achieve its savings in a sort of overlapping sequence. As I mentioned, the front end loan system is already developed, and is in the process of implementation, so we built that and began the process of installing it without you noticing the run up in expenses for that one.","We\u2019re at the peak spend on the financial reporting and accounting project now, and we\u2019ll be implementing that next year. We\u2019re at the peak spend. That will then taper off, but those savings are going to be in fact reinvested in the core transformation project that we\u2019ve talked about, and so forth. So the goal is to basically keep the expenses in total flat over the next number of quarters. And then the actual reduction comes probably out at least a couple of years from now. ","I would note that the Federal Reserve is placing renewed emphasis on all banks, if you look at the CCAR 2015 instructions that just came out. Look at the range of practices document that they published last year. They\u2019re focusing ever more intently on the quality of bank systems, noting that many are antiquated and need to be upgraded. They cannot meet the data requirements with the versatility that they expect going forward.","I would suggest to you that we\u2019re probably at the front end of more than one bank, particularly regional banks, that will be needing to upgrade their systems over the next few years.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research ","But doesn\u2019t having multiple charters make it harder to have best-in-class systems?","Doyle Arnold ","Which is the last question that we\u2019re going to take on that, then we\u2019re going to move on. But the answer is, the charters themselves don\u2019t add that much cost. It\u2019s all in the way one implements it. ","So historically, yes they have, because we have historically allowed each bank to customize things a lot to the way these systems are implemented and run, to suit its own desires. As a part of this overhaul of the system, we are kind of undoing a lot of that customization, because we have to, to get the data consistency, the risk reporting consistency, in a more efficient way. ","What we\u2019re doing now is we\u2019re getting it done, but it\u2019s very manually intensive in some areas, in some ways, and very complicated to do. So you need to divorce a lot of your thinking, in my opinion, about the cost of multiple charters from the cost of multiple systems implementations.","So that\u2019s kind of the approach we\u2019re taking. In the interest of time, I need to move on to another question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson. ","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson","Question on expenses. Can you talk about real estate rationalization and what your thoughts are with regard to branches or office space, and what you think you might be doing there over the next six to eight quarters?","Harris Simmons ","I\u2019d start by noting that we\u2019ve reduced, from 2009 to the present time, we\u2019ve reduced the number of branches by about 12.5%, I think is the last number I saw. And that\u2019s a process that continues. We continue to look at branches. And I would note that one of the things I think all banks are wrestling with right now, we\u2019re in this very low interest rate environment, and the nominal value of branches today, in a lot of cases, doesn\u2019t look great, because the value you attribute to deposits is not very significant today.","But in a normalized rate environment, and particularly under the new liquidity rules in this industry, we think it\u2019s something everybody\u2019s going to have to be careful about, and kind of this transition to more mobile and digital channel use, and kind of what the role of the branches are.","All of that said, we\u2019re continuing, we\u2019ll have some further branch closures in the fourth quarter, some of which haven\u2019t been yet announced. And I don\u2019t have a target in mind, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re continuing to kind of scrub. And we\u2019re particularly trying to really drill down on how staffing requirements are changing, because the real cost of branches isn\u2019t in the number of locations, or the real estate component of it, so much as it is in the staffing. And so that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be paying more attention to.","So those are some kind of general thoughts, but we\u2019re down. I think at our peak, we were, kind of gross, with acquisitions of banks from the FDIC, etc., back in 2009, the end of 2009, we\u2019re up at well over 500 branches. We\u2019re now down to around 465.","Scott McLean","I think we\u2019re pushing 550 if you just take the gross number.","Harris Simmons ","So we\u2019ve actually been doing more than we make a lot of noise about, but it\u2019s a process that continues.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson ","Do you have a sense of what the average square footage is on your branches, or average staffing level?","Harris Simmons ","I have some sense as to the average staffing level. At least I have the data. I don\u2019t have it right here with me, but it\u2019s something that we could probably follow up on. As far as square footage, I don\u2019t have that right available, but it is something that we have generally been reducing. ","The one exception, we\u2019d had branches in grocery stores. We closed a lot of those. In some cases, we built the freestanding branches, and then tend to, by their nature, they\u2019re smaller ones, but they tend to be a little larger than kind of the in-store kind of footprint. But that\u2019s something that we continue to focus on, is just how much real estate we need. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. ","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","On loan yield, can you talk to us about how much more rollover you\u2019re seeing, and anticipate seeing, as you look out those next four quarters on the go-to loan yields versus rolloff? And then attached to it is just, is there any rate forecast in your expectations for slight growth in NII?","Doyle Arnold ","No rate forecast. So that\u2019s not assuming a significant Fed tightening or increase in rates. I\u2019ll point out that we have, in our investor decks, showed you that gap between the current production and the portfolio average, but I think James can give you a quick summary of it here on the line.","James Abbott","Most of the difference between, as Doyle mentioned in the prepared remarks, was because of a shift in the mix of production this quarter. We had more than double the amount of residential and the loans we\u2019ve purchased counted as production there. That\u2019s why there was a decline in yield. Outside of that, we saw small business loan yields decline a little bit linked quarter. Otherwise, most loan yields were fairly stable, and the line managers report to us that they\u2019re seeing general stability in market pricing. So we probably have about 20 basis points of gap between new production pricing and the book of business. And it turns over in about two and a half, maybe three years. So that\u2019ll give you some stuff to work with.","Doyle Arnold ","So back to the first part of your question, the gap is now narrow enough that kind of any swing in interest rates from the Fed could swamp it.","James Abbott","Yeah, a 25 basis point rate hike, our production wouldn\u2019t then [unintelligible] the book of business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Following up on Harris\u2019s earlier comments that debt is now down to 24% of tier one common, where are you targeting that to go to? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much debt gets replaced versus net paid down going forward.","Doyle Arnold ","I would say the bulk of the reduction is done at this point, and there are potentially other uses for cash that we\u2019ll wait to talk about those until the appropriate time. But I think clearly the amount of debt we had was a drag on PP&R, on earnings, and unnecessary. And I think at this point, as I said, the biggest change to debt that you could look to is likely the payoff of some subordinated debt with a very high cost next year. And maybe it just gets paid off, maybe we replace some of that with new lower cost debt.","Only caveat to that answer would be there\u2019s occasional still noise about the Fed requiring certain levels of debt, of [unintelligible] institutions. Nothing formal, but there\u2019s wars and rumors of wars still abound, from time to time out there. But we\u2019re largely done, I think, with what we plan to do.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America "," ","If they raise the bar from $50 billion to anything higher, does that change your forward outlook for loan growth or expenses?","Doyle Arnold","[laughter] Yes. The answer is probably yes to both, dammit, both.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lana Chan with BMO Capital Markets. ","Lana Chan - BMO Capital Markets","Just a quick question on LCR. I guess I\u2019m not sure whether you need to remix the securities portfolio for more HQLA assets?","Doyle Arnold ","Our cash is the HQiest of any asset, and we have a lot of that. That aside, the CDOs are clearly the least liquid. They\u2019re not helpful at all, and we commented on continuing to work those down. Kind of in between those two extremes, we will be looking at, without dramatically changing our asset sensitive position in the near term, kind of what\u2019s the right mix of some Ginnies, some Fannies, or other HQLA and not have it all in cash going forward. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Compass Point. ","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Given where your fee income is right now, and your initiatives to grow it, what percentage of revenue do you think will come from fee income a couple of years down the road?","Harris Simmons ","That\u2019s not something you change overnight, and particularly given that some substantial portions of the total mix are coming from deposit service charges. As I [unintelligible], I think you\u2019re just not going to see much growth in that category across the industry.","Doyle Arnold ","The only way to change it quickly would be to acquire something, and acquiring something entails large premiums, and in this environment, it\u2019s going to be organic, therefore it\u2019s going to be incremental. And therefore, it will take a number of years to move the needle by four or five percentage points.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. ","Gary Tenner - D.A. Davidson","I was just wondering if you could quantify the amount of the construction book that moved over to term versus what you\u2019ve moved off balance sheet otherwise.","Doyle Arnold ","We\u2019ll have to follow up with you on that one. I\u2019m afraid none of us brought that information with us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from John Moran with Macquarie.","John Moran - Macquarie","I\u2019m not sure if you mentioned it in the prepared remarks and I just missed it, but if you didn\u2019t, would you mind quantifying what the fully phased in Basel III capital ratio is?","Doyle Arnold ","We didn\u2019t, so new question. It\u2019s about 11.6%. It\u2019s just a few basis points below, about 25 basis points or so below the Basel I number.","Operator","This ends the Q&A session for today. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for closing remarks.","James Abbott","Thank you everyone for joining.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","It's now my pleasure to turn the time over to James Abbott. Please go ahead, sir.","James R. Abbott","Thank you, Ian. Good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2012 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.","A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?","Harris H. Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you to the call today. Before I start into this, I'm going to go off the script for just a moment and briefly recognize James Abbott here. He's been recognized by all of you, both buy and sell side, as the best IR exec in the mid-cap bank space by Institutional Investor Magazine, and we're really proud of James and the role he plays here. So we may have -- or had a lot of moving parts in our net interest margin and other things, but apparently, at least, we give James credit for explaining it well, and I just want to congratulate James in front of his constituents here.","Expectedly, the quarter -- several underlying trends of the fourth quarter were generally quite strong, with better-than-expected performance from credit quality, from certain of our capital levels, loan growth, net interest income. We're encouraged with our ability to cut some costs as we move through 2012, primarily from the cost of debt and preferred equity. We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to improve our return on equity in 2013 as we intend to further reduce the cost of our capital and financing structure.","Let me touch upon a couple of fundamental highlights for the quarter. Credit quality. First, an 8% national unemployment rate and 2% GDP growth isn't what any of us would call a robust environment, but our credit quality metrics are rapidly returning to levels last seen when the economy was in much stronger shape than it is today. We attribute a portion of the improvement to improved risk management and credit risk reduction efforts for the past few years and, some of it also, the customers' continued ability to repair their personal and business balance sheets despite the tepid economic environment that we're in.","Our net charge-off ratio was only 0.2%, about 20 basis points, a level comparable to the full year of 2007. Our nonperforming asset ratio, expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned dropped just below 2%, and we expect to see further general improvement in that ratio as we continue through the year 2013.","Loan growth. We generally see more variability probably at loan growth in the fourth quarter than other quarters, and this wasn't any exception. As many of you know, we raised the cautionary flag in late November at an investor conference and as loan balances had declined more than $150 million from the end of the third quarter. We subsequently experienced particularly robust growth in December, some of which was related to tax strategies on the part of customers. That would have been obviously unique to the fourth quarter of 2012. Some of it was short-term draws by some of our customers who subsequently paid off a portion of these borrowings in the early part of the first quarter.","Excluding the variability that goes with the fourth quarter, our lenders report to us that they remain positive about growth prospects in the loan portfolio. The pipelines are generally still pretty strong. Customers seem to be generally more optimistic than they were 6 months ago, and production volume rose in each quarter of 2012. Although pricing remains competitive, we have not experienced much additional pressure on the loan production in the last 6 months.","Net interest income declined about $8 million or 2% compared to the prior quarter. In November, we said that we anticipated perhaps a 2% to 3% decline in core net interest income. And while we haven't calculated that for you in this release, I'll note the decline was less than anticipated. We currently believe that net interest income should be relatively stable in 2013.","And then a final comment, just about convexity risk. We're seeing increasing signs of economic activity around the country. And while it's unclear of when interest rates will rise, we're one of the very limited number of banks that are significantly asset-sensitive, as many of you know. Not only do we expect earnings to increase when rates rise, we expect to be able to avoid a significant haircut to equity that many banks may experience due to the heavy concentrations of mortgage-backed securities and other fixed-rate obligations with convexity or optionality in them that we could see in a rising-rate environment.","With that overview, I'll ask our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Doyle Arnold, to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me add my congratulations to James. And let me also note, I'm suffering from a bit of a cold, so if I happen to go into a coughing spell, I may lateral to James at any time to get through my notes and maybe lateral back at some point. So I apologize in advance if I have to do that.","As noted in the release, we did post net income applicable to common shareholders of $35.6 million or $0.19 per diluted common share for the quarter. As noted in the release and as we had previously disclosed back in maybe the early part of December, we recognized -- we did recognize a significant impairment charge against the CDO portfolio this quarter, as well as gains on securities that also came from CDOs, which netted to an after-tax cost of about $0.25 per share. Let me also point -- and we'll talk a lot more about that in a few minutes.","Let me also point out some -- a couple of accounting and disclosure changes that we made this quarter. Although the first with regard to some reclassifications, as described in the press release in some detail, I'll note that we reclassified a couple of items which had the net effect of reducing net interest income and increasing noninterest income. We presented all prior quarters on an as-adjusted basis for comparability. For example, the net interest income is reported at $430 million in the fourth quarter compared to a revised $438 million in the third quarter, whereas we had previously, last quarter, said $444 million. So the net impact of the reclass was $6 million in the third quarter.","The other line item that changed was other service charges, commissions and fees, which increased as a result of the changes. The bottom line, net earnings, pretax or net earnings to common were not impacted at all. We believe these changes bring us into greater consistency with what is common disclosure practices around the industry today.","Also, as Harris didn't highlight but sort of alluded to earlier, this quarter we haven't calculated core net interest income and core net interest margin for you as the primary reasons for calculating that information was just try to strip out some of the noise related to the rather volatile subordinated debt conversions and also some of the income related to loans acquired with FDIC assistance. Conversion activity has slowed to, recently in this quarter, a minimal level. And the FDIC-assisted loan balances have declined to roughly $0.5 billion from more than $2 billion if you go back to late 2009 when they were acquired. So we think the adjustment is becoming less meaningful and informative, so we haven't really highlighted that this quarter. But we have given you, I think, what you need, and those who want to can make that calculation.","Okay, turning to revenue drivers. Average loans increased $100 million compared to the prior quarter. We, of course, pay more attention to average loans because of the variability of -- in the period balances and because of a number that actually drives interest income and earnings for the quarter. In the period, loans increased $463 million, excluding changes in FDIC-supported loans. But approximately $100 million of that has run off thus far in January.","I would note, and we'll talk about it again, that we saw a similar phenomenon that was even more pronounced a year ago of runup and then rundown. The runup wasn't quite as strong this quarter and the rundown at this point hasn't been as strong either.","Let me draw your attention to the loan table on Page 10 of the release. Commercial and industrial loans had some sub-seasonal trends, while they grew nearly 4% from the prior quarter and some of that backed off in January. I'll point out that C&I loans increased 8% compared to the year-ago period. And so the general trend remains positive.","As we've discussed in the past, the decline in owner-occupied loans is largely attributable to a decision made over a year ago as a part of our concentration risk management efforts to selectively reduce certain aspects of our exposure in international real estate business, the bulk of which is the SBA 504 loan product. We expect additional attrition in this portfolio throughout this year before the balance is again destabilized late this year or early next.","Construction and development loans were down $17 million or approximately 1% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, the balance is down 14%. We do expect this category to increase in 2013 due to the fairly strong growth in new commitments made in the second half of 2012. And in fact, balances are up moderately in January.","Current CRE declined at 5 of the banks during the quarter, leading to a decline in the overall balance of about $77 million. This was primarily driven by elevated prepayments, new production volume actually exceeded the trailing 4-quarter average. We do expect this category to grow over time. But in the very near term, it may decline slightly. One of the headwinds to growing this portfolio is the reemergence of a CMBS market where originations were nearly twice as strong in 2012 compared to 2011.","Finally, within consumer lending, the residential first mortgage loans grew at about 4% linked quarter, which is a rate that is comparable to the prior quarter, and the growth was fairly widespread across footprint. That's kind of a sort of a horizon on -- or the landscape on balances.","Turning briefly to commitments. The unused commitments continue to grow at a solid pace even though the average loan growth of balances was not particularly strong. Commitments are growing at -- increasing at an 11% compounded annual growth rate during the last 2 years. A meaningful amount of that increase comes from loans, for example, commercial construction loans that are scheduled to \"fund up\" over the course of the next several months and quarters and thus we believe this should translate into loan balances increasing moderately over the year.","Okay, turning to the net interest margin on Page 14 of the release. You'll note that the NIM declined 11 basis points compared to the third quarter. The components of that decline are roughly as follows: about 4 basis points were simply due to the increase in average cash balances, which you will note were up sharply despite having wired $700 million of cash back to the treasury right at the end of September; another 2 basis points was due to the decline in yield on FDIC-supported loans; and then the decline in other loan yields adversely impacted NIM by about 5 basis points.","As we highlighted a year ago, last January, we didn't think 2012 was going to be a really great year for NIM, and it wasn't. We noted that it would take a significant amount of loan growth, about $400 million to $500 million per quarter, to offset the NIM effect on net interest income more than -- which was much more than roughly $100 million per quarter of average loan growth that did occur. But we also said that as we enter into 2013, the pressure should subside to a more moderate level. And we do still believe that's the case. Assuming a static balance sheet, we estimate the NIM should drift down slightly. However, because a fair amount of resetting and refinancing volume is behind us and because pricing on new loans seems to have somewhat stabilized, the pressure on net interest income over the next 12 months should be much lower than it was in 2012.","Coming briefly to noninterest income, just a basic comment there. There are 2 things worth highlighting, both are related to the CDO portfolio. The first is to the impairment due to higher default probabilities on certain loans and the second is impairment due to higher prepayment assumptions that are most likely to happen in future quarters. First, let me comment on the higher default probabilities. And that was the biggest component of the most notable and noisy item in the quarter, which was the impairment charge of $84 million on CDOs. This was discussed at some length in the earnings release, as well as in the pre-releases and discussions by us at the FBR and Goldman Sachs conferences in late November, early December. But let me quickly recap here.","I'll note that this discussion is not going to be an all-inclusive discussion of every nuance of the CDOs. We've tried to lay out that in great detail in our 10-Qs, and we'll be updating it in the 10-K which will be filed in a month or so. Now it's well-known to you -- most of you that we do own a portfolio of bank trust-preferred CDOs. They're about 800 underlying bank holding companies that are the sources of collateral and cash flow to the trust. If a bank holding company decides to defer interest payments either because its management elects to do so or because its regulators mandated or arm twisted, however they get there, the bank holding company generally, under terms of the offerings, have 5 years in which they can defer payments without triggering an event of default. If they stopped -- if they continue to defer after 5 years, then it is an event of default. But if they come current before that, it's not.","Each bank holding company has one or more subsidiary banks. And historically, as the strength of the subsidiary bank goes, so goes the performance of the cash flows to the trust or the CDO. For example, a well-capitalized profitable bank is generally able to make its payments to its parent bank holding company which, in turn, is unlikely to default. Many of the deferring banks to which we have exposure, about 2\/3 of them, are well-capitalized and profitable. However, we recently noted that some small bank holding companies are beginning to use what is known as a 363 Bankruptcy which could render invalid the assumption that a well capital bank has a low probability of default. Said differently, the subsidiary of the deferring bank holding company might be in decent shape but because the cash may be trapped to subsidiary due to regulatory constraints, the holding company simply may be unable to bring the trust-preferred obligation current at the end of the 5-year deferral period. It's also possible that even if there is cash at the parent company, it may be blocked from flowing out from the bank holding company to the trust by, for example, regulatory orders or things of that nature.","In either case, we, in conjunction with our regulators and consultation with them, recognized therefore that some of the default probabilities on our banks really may be different from the default probabilities of the parent bank holding companies that issued the trust-preferred and, therefore, that our expected loss in some of these cases might need to increase as a result of this new development.","However, because the trust-preferred securities are typically the only security issued by the smaller bank holding companies, we generally rank at or near the highest in the liquidation preference, which means we're still entitled to share in the proceeds of a bankruptcy sale. But if there's a bankruptcy process, then the outcome is less certain.","Again, 2\/3 of deferring bank holding companies are supported by bank subsidiaries that today are well-capitalized and profitable, which may be called -- result in some recovery value even if they do go through this process or get to the end of the 5-year period. However, the sale price of the primary asset, stock of the subsidiary bank, may or may not be sufficient to pay off all of the bank's trust-preferreds.","There's just many a slip between the cup and the lip, as they say, in how these things may get resolved. We intend to be extremely active and have been in pursuing our interest in these cases. And although the number of cases we have pursued is small, we and the other significant holders of these notes or trust-preferred securities have generally been successful at recovering much or all of what our model estimates to be the value of the asset. However, because there's no historical data for re-performance rates and the outcomes of these kind of restructuring and bankruptcy proceedings, other than what we're seeing from our own CDOs, it's also possible we could have to recognize additional OTTI's as new evidence becomes available.","Generally, I'd say as a result of all of this, we went back and looked at the banks in our deferring pool, remodeled them and, as a general matter, increased the probabilities of default and therefore the expected loss on, not all, but a number of them, which led to the majority of the OTTI that we took this quarter.","The remainder largely came from impairment due to higher prepayment assumptions because we've been talking about things that might not pay off timely. Also during the fourth quarter, we saw people paying off more than timely. We saw a significant increase in prepayments by healthier institutions. And therefore the company made a decision to increase the assumed prepayment speeds on performing small banks and here small -- or bank holding companies, and here small is defined as those with less than $15 billion of assets.","Historically, we've observed this CPR speed to be around 3%, which is what we've been modeling. However, the mission we've observed has significant increase in prepayments in the fourth quarter and there are strong arguments to expect continued higher rate for several years as new bank regulations regarding the capital treatment of trust preferred securities are phased in. Therefore, we increased the CPR assumption in our models from 3% to 10% for the next several years. Because cash flows are generally diverted to senior tranches first, this modeling change has the effect of more quickly paying off the senior tranches in full but results in reduced cash flows from the junior tranches as prepayment reduces excess -- let's call it excess spread, really just future cash available to those junior tranches. This could result in weaker credit values of the junior tranches, and did so this year.","Then finally, we also recognized gains from full payoff of previously impaired securities this quarter. We recognize gains when either we get a full payoff on previously impaired securities or we get a paydown on any of the securities that we had previously purchased at fair value out of our former QSPE Lockhart Funding. And the gains this quarter were due to the latter. These were securities that we bought out of the QSPE at a discount to par or amortized cost because that was their fair value, and we subsequently received full value for them. They paid off in cash.","And then finally related to the CDOs, we saw an improvement in the AOCI mark accumulated other comprehensive in part -- income of nearly $90 million after-tax. Some of that was a result of the AOCI mark going to the income statement because of the stuff we just discussed. And in others, it was just a result of -- resulted from improvement in risk spreads for riskier assets that we observed in the market. For the year, AOCI improved approximately $145 million due to, again, CDO valuation improvement.","Turning to credit. The very short version is that we continue to see strong improvement in nonperforming assets and net charge-offs and other credit metrics. As a result, our allowance for credit losses model indicated a more moderate -- a moderate negative provision. We did highlight in the release that the primary reason for the sharp decline in net charge-offs was a very strong quarter for recoveries. Recoveries are expected to continue, but this quarterly weight may have been a particularly high one, and in any event, this is kind of lumpy.","Capital, and let's see, that's the last item before we turn to guidance. The tangible GAAP common equity ratio declined to 7.1% from 7.2% in the prior quarter. And this was due essentially entirely to the significant buildup in deposit balances which were invested in deposits at the Fed, Fed Funds Repos.","The estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio on a Basel I basis declined by about 8 basis points. Deposit balances have declined significantly since year end, which has resulted in a reduction of total tangible assets. These declines do not appear to be related to the expiration of TAG, and we kind of welcome them in a sense and the reduction should remove pressure on the GAAP capital ratios in the first quarter. And that's, I believe, that's for capital.","Okay, a little bit of guidance and for the next few quarters, kind of how does 2013 look, and then we will turn to your questions. First, loan growth. With continued strength in the loan pipelines and the increase in commitment in the last 6 months and our customers seemingly feeling a bit more optimistic, we expect continued moderate loan growth over the coming 1 year or coming year.","Net interest income. We do expect the net interest income to be relatively stable, at least in the next few months and quarters.","The margin can be volatile due to the cash balances which, as noted previously, declined so far in Q1 after increasing dramatically in Q4. But on a static balance sheet and a stable rate environment, we would expect some additional compression in the NIM, but offsetting that would be the loan growth that appears is likely.","Noninterest income. We expect the less volatile components of noninterest income such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend. We don't have much income from Mortgage Banking but even as the current refi booms, besides we expect some degree of offset to the slowing refis due to the fact that we're small in the market and we have been increasing our efforts to expand our mortgage lending business.","Noninterest expense. The primary challenges to noninterest expense from the first quarter will be the increase in salary and benefits and the usual tax, social security-related stuff. Also in the fourth quarter, we reversed about $3 million of previously accrued incentive compensation, as certain long-term plans were no longer expected to payout at the previously accrued rate because of the performance in 2012. So 2012's expense was depressed because of that and we won't have that in the first quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2012, that is, was held down because of that.","So provision expense. We expect the provision expense to remain low. Continued reduction in problem credits and the ongoing improvement in loss severity rates continue to have the potential to result in a negative provision in the third quarter as it was in the fourth quarter. Although if loan growth strengthens enough, that could offset the ability to have negative provisions.","Preferred stock dividends. We also, for those of you who haven't seen it, released after market today a press release announcing our intent to issue a new Series G preferred stock, and we expect to be issuing some additional preferred stock during the first half of 2013. We've previously discussed with you the fact that our Series C preferred stock, 9.5%, is callable in the third quarter of 2013 and we're -- and that we would be unlikely to call it without issuing probably not 100% of it in replacement preferred but a significant portion. So we'll be issuing some of that preferred which will temporarily drive dividend expense up. But in the long term, it should reduce the -- further reduce preferred stock dividend costs significantly.","I believe that's enough of a monologue for me. And we'll -- operator or moderator, if you could queue up the questions, we will endeavor to respond to them.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you give us some greater details on the outlook for the relatively stable NII? Is that relative to 4Q's level or relative to the entire 2012? And does the outlook include any of the capital actions that you laid out that will reduce interest expense?","Doyle L. Arnold","I think the comment was relative to kind of 4Q as a starting point, not the whole year. But kind of the basic thing I tried to convey was whereas a year ago we thought net interest income would be trending down pretty steadily throughout 2012. We think that 2013 will first see a slowing then a flattening and then an improvement as we go through '13. That's what I tried to convey. Now, in general, there may be some noise in the net interest income and noninterest expense as a result of some of the things that we may do during the course of the year. So those were -- kind of my comments were back to the concept of a core. And I'll -- maybe without going into get too great a detail and tipping our hand, I mean, to the extent that we issue new debt in replacement of debt to be maturing or what have you, that will temporarily drive interest expense up. To the extent, however, that we tender for debt ahead of its maturity, that temporarily drives interest or other expense up but then drops it significantly. So what we will do, I want to get away from us computing a core, what we will try to do each quarter in which some of these things occur, if they occur, is give you a quantification of the components so you can make the adjustment that you deem to be appropriate. James, do you have any other comment on that? Okay, go ahead.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just as a follow-up. I know you talked about the rate of decline and the NIM slowing. And last year, you had talked about $400 million to $500 million of average loan growth needed to offset. How has that changed as we look into 2013? So what type of loan growth do we need to see in order to keep NII flat?","Doyle L. Arnold","Significantly less. I don't know that we have an exact number that we've calculated yet. But do we, James? Do you have a good idea? But I'll tell you...","James R. Abbott","Probably around 2% to 3%. 2% to 3% loan growth would take care of the margin compression.","Doyle L. Arnold","And the reason is that we have gotten through the largest single period of 5-year resets that -- of loans that were made back in 2007 when rates and spreads -- the rates were much higher. They've all reset. All of those have reset. By the first half of 2008, originations of those kinds of loans had already begun to trend off. And by the second half, they've really collapsed as the economy -- well, you don't remember what happened in 2008. So the number -- the amount of loans that are resetting from higher rates that were prevalent 5 years ago to the very low rate environment today will be smaller in the first half, still significant but smaller in the first half of '13 than it was throughout last year. And by the second half of the year, it will -- that phenomena will be 80% behind us. The other thing is that loan pricing, as I mentioned, has stabilized whereas it's going back to the beginning of last year, the pricing of new loans was still trending down a bit. It does seem to have stabilized through most of the year. So there are particularly -- there are very specific reasons that we can point to, to say. And I guess to further it, I think the volume of out of the money options that matured in '12 was also higher than in '13 and '14. There's still some, but all of those headwinds are smaller this year and going forward than they were last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","On your NII, stable NII, what type of interest rate scenario do you have or interest rates don't really matter now because of all the resets running through?","Doyle L. Arnold","I was --  my comments were not predicated on much of a change in the interest rate environment. We remain -- I didn't comment on this, but we remain very highly asset-sensitive so that if the Fed does tighten or, if for any reason, rates were to rise earlier than the Fed has indicated, we believe that would change my guidance or outlook on net interest income. We would benefit significantly from rising interest rates.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So the stable NII...","Doyle L. Arnold","I'd say the stable -- you're talking NII, you mean net interest income, yes?","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, I tell you -- that's a comment if rate stay kind of as they are, low throughout the year.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then also with buying back your, I think, Series C preferreds, I believe towards the end of the year, so really you're not going to get any benefit from buying that back into 2014, am I correct?","Doyle L. Arnold","No. It's actually, it's a call. It's not a buyback technically. It is callable at par September 15 of -- so the benefit will be there throughout the entire fourth quarter, whatever it is.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And is that the only series that's callable? I was thinking of the slide presentation at Goldman Sachs, can you talk about 2 different series?","Doyle L. Arnold","Our trust-preferred Series B, which has $293 million of outstanding, is callable at par at any time. And that's 8% cost.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So when you issue this new preferred, can you sort of call it back immediately or you just haven't set a time frame for that yet?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm not going to give you enough detail, sorry, to specifically build a quarter-by-quarter model because I'm not going to get into the specific details of what was in my stress test and capital plan submitted to the Fed until I know they've completed their review and hopefully found that acceptable. But we'll announce what we need to announce, at this level of detail then.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Regarding the $200 million of series G announced today, I just wanted to follow up on that. It's a bit smaller than I was looking for as it relates to the Series C. Doyle, what are you targeting for preferreds to represent as a percent of risk-weighted assets and just curious what your thoughts were to do this now versus closer to the timing when you could call the Series C?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm sorry, I just blinked. What was the first part of your question?","James R. Abbott","Percentage of preferreds.","Doyle L. Arnold","Oh, yes. Yes, we've -- if you go back and look at our investor presentations throughout much of last year, I think starting with our hosted Investor Day in February we've, at various points in time, indicated that roughly 2% of risk-weighted assets would be our target level for preferred. It's somewhere -- or other Tier 1, which would include today some trust-preferred. Including a trust-preferred that were today, I believe, at around 3.3%, something like that percent, so -- and the Series C makes up the bulk of it. Trust-preferred is the second smallest piece and then series A and series E are the remainder of it. So we've also -- you didn't ask us specifically, but we've also indicated in various investor forum that we were unlikely to call the 800 -- approximately 800 million of Series E without issuing something on the order of 500 million to 600 million of perpetual preferred and partial replacement of it to get to those ratios. And we've also noted that the trust-preferred long-term isn't of any use as Tier 1 capital. So that kind of gives you, I think, the context of where we're trying to get to and what the major levers are to pull to get there. In terms of timing, I guess all I'd like to point out is that we've kind of consistently laid out a number of things that we want to do or need to address over the course of the next -- this year and the next to get the capital and financing structure in line with what they've indicated as our kind of medium-term target and to get the cost down. And we can't do it all at one time, so we're trying to basically trying to spread it out in a reasonable way.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's good color, Doyle. And just separately, I know the yield opportunity in the securities book isn't great, but it's better than the 28 bps that you're getting in the money market investments. Are there any thoughts there moving some of that liquidity into the securities book as you try and stabilize net interest income?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes. Something we look at continuously. Again, we don't know how to spell NBS very well here. So I think we could -- the challenge is to get a 2% plus yield, you're going to take some kind of risk. The risk of negative convexity is one that we're very wary of, doing very much of that. I think our actions back our words there. But there are things between 25 bps and 200 basis points that we look at from time to time and they do a little of. We also have a much better read, I think as this quarter goes on, of just what the long-term-or at least medium-term deposit balances of our customers are. As I mentioned, a significant chunk of that, $2.5 billion increase in deposits that occurred in the fourth quarter, has reversed already in the first quarter. So we'll have a little bit better idea of what we're looking at here as we get through the end of this quarter. But we're not going to go take on a lot of negative convexity risk. Yes, we may deploy some of it into probably lower yielding securities, but that are very safe and don't have the risk of extending maturities or duration when you don't want them to. I think that on previous call, David articulated very clearly what we're looking for. I laid down our criteria and invited any of you to call who had such an opportunity, and we're still waiting for the first phone call.","James R. Abbott","Like a March of Dimes telephoned around here. But maybe I'll just jump in those. The amount that we might do in some of these securities that Doyle was referring to would be very small. I don't think it would really affect your net interest income outlook much.","Doyle L. Arnold","In any one pool, we might be talking about some hundreds of millions and then totally we might be talking about $1 billion to $2 billion if we can find that. But we want to keep a lot of our powder for loan growth, which we do believe will happen someday, maybe even starting this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question in terms of the CPR assumptions on the CDOs. I think I heard that you said that they're now at 10%, which obviously is a pretty big jump from where they were. Can you give us some context? How aggressive is that assumption? Because I guess sort of, we thought 3% to 5% might be aggressive. Now it's 10%. Obviously, this has been a big headwind for the OTTI or the losses on that portfolio historically, but I'm just trying to get a sense of the likelihood of further charges going forward?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'll offer a bit of commentary, and then invite David Hemmingway to chime in. We look at the actual and kind of historical trend every quarter. And throughout most of -- throughout the latter part of 2011, probably first 2 or 3 quarters of 2012, then I mean, the number bounced around between under 2% and under 4%, and kind of was heavily anchored around 3%. So we don't think that number was aggressive. We look -- we kind of look at the current -- what happened in the current quarter, what happened in the previous quarter and sort of what's the rolling fourth quarter average and [indiscernible] and just commentary on what we think is going on in the Street from investor bankers and other things. I don't think it was an aggressive assumption. I think it was very real and anchored in observable data. What changed in the fourth quarter was the observable data where we had the actual prepayments in the fourth quarter were significantly higher than 10% --","Unknown Executive","12%.","Doyle L. Arnold","12%. But we didn't -- it's kind of hard to go from 3.5%, 2.5%, 4% to 3%, 12%, and say well maybe we ought to go to 15% or go to 12%. So we moved it to 10% thinking that was a reasonable change based on what we observed and based on the fact that -- this change, by the way, only applied, remember, to the smaller banks, the ones that technically were not required under, I figure it was Basel or Dodd-Frank -- I think Dodd-Frank, to phase out trust-preferred, but for which the regulators proposed to phase them out over a 10-year period in lieu [indiscernible] that were issued early in the year or midyear but have not yet been made final. So David, you want to comment on anything else?","W. David Hemingway","I can say the 10% that you're referring to, while we raised it, even though the quarter was 12%, we raised it to 10%. It's only for 3 years, and then the model assumes that the prepayment rate drops back to 3%. And really, over the next 3 years, you're going to get a lot of input and clarity as to what's going to happen in this portfolios because the 5-year deferral period is up. We believe there's going to be a lot of sales of banks and debit transactions. I think probably 10% for 3 years is a reasonable assumption that we think once that these deferring banks get resolved, you could well see lower prepayments which is what's built into the model at the present time.","Doyle L. Arnold","And well within that time frame we should get a final rule from the Fed and others on whether or not smaller bank trust-preferreds will be phased out as Tier 1 Capital and, if so, over what time period.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, that does help. And then just the other question I had, if you were to tender, do an early tender for your outstanding sub-debt, presumably you'd have to take all the, I guess, unamortized discount, I guess, as an accelerated amortization today, which would hit your equity by, I think, it's over $100 million or so. Would -- is it -- should we assume, unless current replacement capital or an equity raise would be needed, to support that accelerated amortization from the early tender? Or is that presumably something you could ask for in your stress test by regulators as sort of a give me given your earnings over the next year?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, again, I don't want to be dragged into what anything that's -- what's entered in our capital plan and stress test. I mean, you are correct in -- at the level of detail, at least, that you described that if you tendered and paid a premium to the current book value of debt, there would be an earnings and capital cost to doing so. I think that I would just offer to comment that it would seem, unless we paid a premium that you just couldn't refuse, it would be unlikely that we would give anything close to a full tender of the sub-debt. And I would just say, I think that we would -- I mean, for me it would be a very bad trade to pay a premium for a sub-debt and issue -- have the trade be issuing common at below book value.","James R. Abbott","And unlikely that we'd put that kind of thing in our capital play.","Doyle L. Arnold","I realized that while you voted James #1, all of you, you demoted me this year. But I hope you don't think we're that stupid. I didn't realize how far I'd plummeted [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","The 2% pref RWA target, I mean, I know you've said it over and over again. I think a lot of people probably were hoping you were being conservative. And I guess maybe one of the things a lot of us struggle with, Wells, which is a much bigger bank has been very explicit about 1.5% RWA pref target. Some of the banks who are more in your size range are still kind of holding out to hope they can get away with like 75 or 100 basis points. So why -- how should we think about -- do you think the whole industry eventually will be too? Or do you think your capital structure just will always be a little high on prefs. How should we think about you relative to the rest of the industry?","Doyle L. Arnold","I would guess that if we look long term, 1.5% to 2% is not a bad place to be. The 2% is at the higher end of that range. I do -- it's really hard to get a gauge. I mean, if you simply read the Basel rules, and we've got close to 10% CET1, there's no reason to have any preferred. I mean, there's -- it absorbs no loss. I mean, I can understand your frustration. But I think from the regulators, the FDIC standpoint, it doesn't absorb loss for our shareholders. It's not ongoing. But it is a going concern, shouldering of lost to the FDIC. They're going to want to see it there. I do think you're going to see a lot of preferred issue this year in replacement of trust-preferred or just as issuance. And I think -- the whole -- we're 3.3% today and the industry is at 1.1%. We're going to come down, they're going to come up. And I think we'll all end up meeting somewhere between 1.5% and 2%. It's not a -- my 2% number is not a, \"Boy, I'm going to manage it every quarter to that number.\" But we're going to end up somewhere in that range.","James R. Abbott","One of the other advantages, Brian, is as you issue at these low rates you can fix in pricing. Presumably, loan growth and risk-weight assets growth will grow over time, so you can kind of grow into it. That's another possible reason why you might want to set a little higher, a little sooner.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes. That's why James is the #1 analyst.","Brian Foran","Fair enough. One follow-up on reserves and the potential for a negative provision in any given quarter. I guess 2 related questions. One, kind of how do you think about where reserve to loans is likely to trend over time? And then two, your reserve for unfunded commitment, I realize the provision is kind of a rounding error this quarter, but the stock is higher than most banks relative to your total outstanding unfunded commitments. So should we also think about that line item flipping to negative? Or you mentioned that commitments are growing pretty fast right now and other stuff that's going on that would keep that at 0 even if the provision was negative?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I will just point out and you can decide whether or not to give us credit for 2 facts. One, we're -- among our peers, we had just about the lowest charge-off rate or one of the very lowest charge-off rates this quarter, and we've got one of the highest loan loss reserves. Those 2 facts, and we've got one of the highest reserve on funding commitments relative. So I mean, you put all that together and it says there's very little pressure to boost reserves at this point. Our models and our process are going to drive it. There's not a specific number we're targeting toward, but we're -- I just can't point to anything on the horizon that says that there's a reserve build in the future for the next 2 quarters, and probably continue to drawdown some reserve. I can't find anything that points otherwise. One of my credit officers here staring at me from the other end of the table, but I'm a long way from him. He can't reach me right now.","Harris H. Simmons","I might also just note that the recoveries in the fourth quarter were particularly strong. I mean, whether you have negative provisions or not, maybe driven largely by what recoveries continue to look like. That's a predictable, vulnerable part of the equation. And that will be a big factor in our thinking.","James R. Abbott","We're going to probably end up going over time a little bit. So we'll maybe take the next 2 or 3 questions, but we will have to cut it off and call people back. I apologize, there are a number of questions remaining.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I would just -- question looking closer at loan totals. I was wondering if there was any chance of getting a breakdown of kind of new credit extensions and advances versus the amount of paydowns and maturities and how those amounts compare with last quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","I made James take that out of the call script because it was already too long, and he told me somebody was going to answer that question. He's the #1 analyst.","James R. Abbott","All right. We had -- production was up quite a bit. It was up 16%, Joe, in the quarter and actually year-over-year. So if you're concerned about seasonality, we actually -- from a year-over-year perspective, it's just been a much stronger quarter. Yields were -- on CNI, yields were up a little bit. Some of the other products were down slightly on production. The yields are still dilutive to the existing book of business. But one little factor that I thought was interesting as I looked through all the data was that C&I -- the portfolio of C&I loans declined only 3 basis points in terms of yield this quarter compared to the third quarter. That is a really slow rate of decline compared to what it's been dropping in the past. And so we are getting close to the point where the production is converging with the portfolio.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then another quick question. Just besides the comp reversal or the accrual there, are there any other outsized or unusual items in the fourth quarter expenses you'd quantify, preferred to some legal matters or OREO expenses tied to?","Harris H. Simmons","Well, OREO expenses doesn't evolve. I think we told you last quarter it's unlikely to be that low the following quarter. Maybe -- but it's going to bounce around, it may go lower this quarter. Legal, go ahead.","Doyle L. Arnold","As you said, legal is probably up [ph]. I think the other noninterest expense line item was high and people have trouble reading that out.","Harris H. Simmons","Yes, and that's accrual for some -- I mean, about the cost of defending some cases and incurring for possible judgments or settlements. I'm obviously not going to get any more specific than that. But it's hard to know what will happen in future quarters on some of these. We certainly think we've reserved adequately. And if that turns out to be the case, that number will come back down because once you reserved it -- you don't reserve it, but if the future developments dictate, we may do it again. That's another one that's just hard to predict every quarter. But I don't think, there's -- you should not take that increase from third quarter to fourth quarter and trend line it in the legal and in the other expenses.","Operator","We have time for one final questioner. Our final question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow up on that prior question about loans. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks about how some of these quarters, some originations had paid down after the quarter end. So just wondering, in that context, have you said that some of the deposits have gone out the door after the quarter? Can you give us some understanding of the -- on the loan side? That temporary increase, was it meaningful or was it modest?","Doyle L. Arnold","I think I can just give you the fact. So where are we? As of last Friday, so basically through the month of January, the $463 million increase in loans in the fourth quarter, most of which occurred in the last 4 to 6 weeks, was backed down by $100 million. Some categories still are growing like CMI. So it's not a complete reversal. On the other hand, the deposits were up, I think $2.5 billion and about $1.5 billion of that, back down about $1.5 billion in a month. Now we can't point to a long list of specific customers who drew down loans late in the year and then paid them back down. And we're not sure what that's all about, so those are the aggregate numbers we're talking about.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then so when you net that altogether, if you presume that that carries forward, you have presumably average loans that are going to grow and then -- but the average size of the balance sheet should shrink so...","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Shouldn't that help the margin? I mean, why -- are we still going to see margin pressure even underneath all of that? And what would it be coming from that? Because I would think that your mix, your loan mix would be helping you get to that kind of NIM stability. So where are you still seeing the compression coming from underneath?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I told you where it was coming from. But I do agree with you, the stated NIM will benefit significantly from -- if the size of the cash assets funded by deposits shrinks back down. We've quantified in the prepared remarks that I think it was 5 basis points of margin compression was just -- you could just attribute it to the huge cash build-up during the quarter to the extent that reverses. That's a good offset to some of the other pressures. So I didn't want to -- I don't want to overstate the NIM compression in any 1 quarter going forward. I come back to -- for that and a whole bunch of other reasons, I think the NIM compression will be much more modest this year than last. If it occurs, most of it will be in the first half of the year, not that the last half of the year unless we see some dramatic change in loan pricing. And it will take half as much loan growth to completely offset it in terms of net interest income as we told you it would last year.","James R. Abbott","Yes, those [indiscernible] positives, I think.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you. And my last one is just on the characters -- I heard you walk through which lines you expect to grow within the loan buckets. But where are you seeing this -- within the C&I book or within the books you expect to grow, what's changing underneath the surface? Like where is the end demand change the most to the positive within that commercial side of the portfolio?","Doyle L. Arnold","Energy.","Harris H. Simmons","Texas.","Doyle L. Arnold","Texas has done well. Have you heard of frac-ing. I mean that's -- I mean -- by far the strongest is in Amegy, but it's pretty wide.","James R. Abbott","I was going to say, the energy loans are up about 5% over the last 6 months, not annualized. Finance, merger and acquisition related financing has also been strong. It was not a strong -- came from behind in the last month, but it was a strong month, December for finance. So those are a couple of the categories. Other categories are still doing well, but there are several -- there's only really one category that's down, which is construction-related businesses.","Doyle L. Arnold","We can come back. Let me just kind of come back to one thing. One thing that gives me confidence that the decline, the run-up and then rundown in deposits was not TAG-related but also was kind of a onetime phenomena. We know of several very specific instances in which companies were sold late in the year and the deals closed in December because of an anticipated change in capital gains tax. I mean, you've heard about some of the high-profile things about movie studios. Lucasfilms being sold and things of that nature. But there are some closely held companies that we bank that -- and we got -- the companies were sold, the deal closed, a ton of cash came into their balance, to the owners of the company's balance sheet and then moved off fairly quickly. But there was a lot of \"let's do this now before rates maybe rise\" and of course, rates did rise subsequent to year end. And I think that's what we're -- a lot of that $2.5 billion up and $1.5 billion down is -- can be tied to that.","I believe we'll have to wrap it up, moderator.","Operator","Sure thing. I'll turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","James R. Abbott","Thanks, Siri, and thanks to all of you. We do have a list of those of you who are still waiting in the queue, and I will get back to you if you'll stay put. We'll get back to you tonight. Thanks for standing by, and thanks for your attendance on the call today. And we will see you at our conference sometime during the quarter.","Harris H. Simmons","Thank you much.","Operator","Thank you, gentlemen. Again, ladies and gentlemen, this does concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may now all disconnect."],"23146":["Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2018  5:30 PM ET","Executives","James Abbott - IR","Harris Simmons - Chairman and CEO","Paul Burdiss - CFO","Scott McLean - President and COO","Michael Morris - Chief Credit Officer","Ed Schreiber - Chief Risk Officer","Analysts","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","John Pancari - Evercore","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Christopher Spahr - Wells Fargo","Steve Moss - B.

You\u2019ve joined the Zions Bancorporation's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James Abbott","Thank you, Latif, and good evening everyone on the call. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2018 third quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives; after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook over the next four quarters. Additional executives with us today is Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer.","Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full release as well as the slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","This earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout our disclosures.","A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. During the question-and-answer section of this call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will turn the time now over to Harris Simmons. Harris?","Harris Simmons","Thank you very much, James and we welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our 2018 third quarter results. The results of the quarter were strong relative to the year-ago results.","Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights. At a high level, perhaps most importantly, we are pleased with the strongly positive operating leverage with noninterest expense nearly flat relative to the prior year while net revenues increased in the mid single-digit range. Much of what we're doing is designed to push the tremendous operating leverage that we've experienced during the past 3.5 years and the future years.","Loan growth was relatively healthy in a quarter that can often have a slowness due to seasonal reasons. We are encouraged with our deposit costs exhibiting relatively low increase compared to benchmark rates. More encouraged was further growth in average non-interest bearing deposits, something that\u2019s not easily accomplished when interest rates are rising.","Our credit quality profile continues to improve at a rapid rate remarkably trailing 12 month net charge-offs ratio was only 100% to percentage or 1 basis point. Finally, relative to the prior quarter we increased the dollars of capital return to shareholders. While we intend to further reduce the capital ratios to better reflect the risk profile of the company, we still have one of the very strongest capital levels within the regional bank space with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.1%.","Before we dig into the numbers, within the famous simplification and streamlining I would also like to know that we completed our merger of the holding company with and into the Bank, reducing organizational complexity and eliminating duplicate regulatory oversight.","On Slide 4, you can see the improvement of earnings rising to a dollar four per share from $0.72 per share and year-ago period. Although we don't provide the so-called core EPS figure, we do highlight some items that affected the earnings per-share that we view as episodic, we are not sustainable in the long run which were listed on the slide.","Graphically the GAAP result is the darker blue -- are the darker blue bars. While the adjusted result is shown in the light blue bars. Much of the variance is due to continued improvement in credit quality including interest recoveries, expect the net interest margin as well as negative provisions for credit losses. We benefited particularly from the relatively rapid improvement in the quality of loans to the oil and gas sector.","We still have some expected benefit left from this [source], but we are nearing the end of that favorable impact. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2018 continued the trend of strong growth by my calculations, if one eliminates the effective interest recoveries, negative provisions for loan losses and a few hold the tax rate constant with the year-ago period. Our EPS growth was in the high teens relative to the third quarter last year.","Slide number 5, highlights two key profitability metrics, return on assets and return on tangible common equity. We are happy to see the return on assets at about 1.3% even after adjusting for items and for the return on tangible common equity to expand to exceed one -- to exceed 14%. We continue to work hard to further strengthen these measures and with higher capital distributions, we expect the return on tangible common equity to continue to strengthen.","Pre-provision net revenue as depicted on slide six has performed particularly well rising 16% over the past year and nearly doubling since we embarked on her efficiency initiative in late 2014. Adjusted for the items noted on the slide, our pre-provision net revenue increased 15% from the year-ago quarter. We were said and continue to expect the pre-provision net revenue growth rate to be in the high single digits without giving consideration to additional interest rate increases by the federal open market committee. We're seeing momentum in several areas of revenue growth including several areas of lending such as residential mortgage, owner-occupied properties and municipal lending.","In trust and wealth management and other select areas within fee income. Meanwhile, costs, both interest bearing liability and non-interest bearing expense have been relatively well contained. On Slide seven you'll see the strong credit trends depicted on the chart on the right with classified loans declining a very strong 37% from year-ago period and 17% from the prior quarter.","Improvement in oil and gas loans was a major reason for the improvement. For the third quarter, we experienced net credit recoveries of $1 million or about one basis point of loans annualized. Net charge-offs for the last four quarters were only 1 basis point of average loans. We expect the low overall rate of net charge-offs in the months ahead assuming current economic conditions remain generally stable.","Additionally, as you can see from the allowance ratios we're still maintaining strong coverage of nonperforming assets and other problem credit metrics. We continued continue to adjust upward our qualitative factors to reflect stressors that can be observed in the economy generally such as the implementation of tariffs, higher interest rates and the effect that they may have on certain borrowers and higher oil and gas prices which may reduce profit margins for certain commercial businesses drag on consumer spending et cetera.","Quantitatively, however, we've not seen a credit deterioration within the risks portfolio types. Slide 8 is a is a list of our key objectives for 2018 and ","19 and our commitment to shareholders. We presented this slide in prior earnings calls, and industry conferences throughout the year. So I will avoid reading the slide to you. But I'm pleased with the progress we've made on so many of these initiatives all of which set us up to increase our return of capital to shareholders.","We increased that rate from about 20% of earnings to more than a 110%. We' view an increase of balance sheet leverage is appropriate, particularly given the reduction of the risk profile of the company. The decision on the magnitude timing and form of capital return as a board level decision and to preempt the question of the board meets later this week to discuss among other things capital returns, such as share buybacks and common stock dividends.","With that overview, I will turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials and additional detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris and good evening, everyone thank you for joining us. I will begin on Slide 9. For the third of 2018 Times net interest income continued to demonstrate growth relative to the prior period. Excluding interest recoveries as detailed on the slide net interest income increased $40 million to $562 million, up approximately 8%. With respect to the revenue components, I'll start with volume and move to rate in just a moment.","Slide 10 shows our average loan growth of 3.5% relative to the year-ago period. Although not listed on the slide, the period and growth in third quarter relative to the second quarter within annualized 5%, with strength weighted towards the end of the quarter. Average deposits increased about 3% from the year-ago period and increased and annualized 5% from the prior quarter.","Thus far, we've been able to achieve this growth of balances with a relatively modest increase in deposit costs. This speaks to the granularity and overall quality of our deposit franchise as we discussed in detailed at our Investor Day this past March. Examining loan growth a bit closer, Slide 11 depicts our year-over-year period and loan balance growth by portfolio type with the size of the circles represent representing the relative size of the portfolio. For most categories, we are -- we experienced solid and consistent growth.","There are three areas where we've experienced slight attrition. In the commercial real estate space, loan growth was adversely impacted by slight attrition in the term CRE and national real estate portfolios of about $240 million\/ Within non-oil and gas C&I loans relative to the prior quarter we experienced an annualized attrition rate of about 4% on our larger loans that is loans with balances, greater than or equal to $5 million, while experience an annualized growth rate of about 4% on a smaller lot. The incremental competitive pressure on larger commercial loans seems to be coming from capital markets activity and some listening of credit standards among competitors including unregulated senior debt funds.","We experienced relatively consistent growth trends in one to four family and home equity loans and experienced a slight uptick in the growth rate of owner-occupied which are generally small business loans underwritten based upon the cash flow of the borrower and secured by real estate.","Oil and gas loans have increased moderately, resulting primarily from a relatively strong increase in upstream and midstream loans, while oilfield services declined slightly. Municipal loan growth has also continued to be strong during the past year. To repeat what I mentioned on last quarter's call, we\u2019ve hired staff to help us grow in this area, which is focused on smaller municipalities and essential services of those cities.","We've maintained strong credit quality standards and feel comfortable with the growth and expect growth to remain strong in this area. Although we are optimistic in the near-term about the growth of loans based upon a relatively strong economic backdrop, an improvement in small business loan growth and review of pipeline, we're also seeing some factors that may result in some growth pressures including debt funds and capital markets that are highly competitive for pricing and for term, which affects our larger loans and underwriting standards that are softening within loans remaining in the banking industry as noted in the recent additions of the senior loan officer survey. Enterprise pricing that may not satisfy our risk reward appetite. Therefore we are modifying our 12-month outlook loan growth to slightly to moderately increasing.","Slide 12 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which increased to 4.71% of which about 2 basis points are related to the previously mentioned interest recoveries. The yield excluding interest recoveries has increased about 40 basis points over the past year, which is a loan yield change of slightly more than 50% relative to the change in the fed funds rate.","Relative to the prior quarter, the yield on securities increased slightly. The shorter duration of the investment portfolio in combination with new security purchases which were accretive to the yield of a portfolio help invest the yield overall in the investment portfolio. While the premium amortization is very difficult to forecast, assuming stability in that area, we expect the yield on the securities portfolio to move higher at a moderate pace over the next several quarters and years based upon the yield securities we are purchasing.","The cost of total deposits and borrowed funds increased 5 basis points in a quarter to 0.45% or 45 basis points resulting in a funding beta of about 30% for the year-over-year figure. As a reminder, in this case beta refers to the change in the cost of deposits and borrowings relative to the change in the cost of the fed funds target rate. The total year-over-year deposit data was about 21% relative to the prior quarter was 29%.","Cumulatively since the beginning of the rising rate environment, we\u2019ve experienced a total deposit beta of about 11%. These elements combined to result in a net interest margin of 3.63% for the quarter, which increased 7 basis points from the prior quarter and 18 basis points from the year-ago period. Excluding interest recoveries in excess of $1 million per loan, that ended net interest margin beta was 21% over the prior year and 26% over the prior quarter. We believe it is reasonable to expect deposit competition to intensify somewhat over the next several quarters.","And if so the net interest margin beta, if I can use that term, maybe modestly less sensitive when compared to the recent quarter. Next a brief review of noninterest income on Slide 13. Customer related fees increased 2.5% over the prior year to $125 million. The primary source of income that increased and decreased are listed on the page we continue to work hard to increase our fee income, although the fees from treasury management, our influence to agree. To a degree by deposits and market rates for earnings credit applied to those balances. which in a rising rate environment creates slight headwind in our fee income trend.","Similarly, the fee income realized from mortgage banking activity tend to be a little countercyclical slowing and possibly decreasing the economy strengthens due to the effects of higher rates and refinancing activity. Noninterest expense on Slide 14 increased to $420 million from $413 million in the year-ago quarter. However, adjusted noninterest expense which is just for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other similar items noninterest expense was very stable at 416 million versus $414 million in the year-ago period. A portion of the increase relates to additional compensation that we announced in conjunction with the Tax Cut and Jobs act which will be paid to most employees making less than $100,000 per year.","These items account for about $3 million increase over the year-ago quarter. With the holding company merger in the rearview mirror along with other items in the professional and legal line item, we experienced a slight decline in that line items and we expect the quarterly level to remain a bit lower than it had been during the past year or so. Also, as noted on the slide we had a one-time adjustment to our FDIC deposit insurance costs in the third quarter, assuming the deposit insurance fund reaches 1.35% and the insurance surcharge is removed and considering our issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured debt late in the third quarter and the movement of other unsecured debt out of the holding company and into the Bank, as the Bank and HoldCo is now merged.","This would result all of these things combined would result in a lower insurance costs relative to other two -- other secured funding. And as a result, we expect our FDIC insurance expense in the fourth quarter in all of those cases to be about $7 million.","Turning to Slide 15, the efficiency ratio was 58.8% compared to the year-ago period of 62.3%. We reiterate our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio below 60%, while the full-year 2019 excluding the possible benefits of rate increases. Finally on Slide 16, this depicts our financial outlook for the next 12 months relative to the third quarter of 2018.","In the interest of opening the line up for questions, I won't read the rest of the slide to you, but we will be happy to take questions about any of the these items. This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dave Rochester","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Dave.","Dave Rochester","Just the question on capital. Now that you guys are effectively out of that stock, your got more clarity and control everywhere, capital levels go from here. I know you talked about bringing the CET1 ratio down to just above peer levels in the next six quarters or so. It seems like that would imply a decent step up in the buyback going forward, especially if loan growth is -- maybe not a solid mid-single in terms of growth going forward, is that a fair statement? And any rough sense as to what that means in terms of dollars over the next year?","Harris Simmons","Well, it's certainly a fair -- you\u2019ve done the math appropriately I think there, I mean, we are simply reluctant to be to specific about it because -- our Board hasn\u2019t and I don\u2019t want to front run them. Now its -- but it would certainly be our view that, that kind of target is still achievable and that\u2019s the discussion that we will be having with the Board here the end of this week.","Dave Rochester","Okay. That\u2019s fair. I appreciate that. And then, I guess, some of your peers have talked about reducing ratios over time as well and are talking about lower levels than where they are today, and I know your discussions have talked about based on where your peer capital ratios are today. And so if we're talking about lower peer ratios over the next six to eight quarters, are you guys still thinking about walking your ratios down as well versus the targets that you have been talking about in the last quarter or so, that makes sense.","Harris Simmons","Yes. So I guess I answer it by saying fundamentally we are not going to determine what our capital ratios ought to be primarily by looking at where peers are. We're going to continue to do a lot of -- to do stress testing, we expect to do that actually probably quarterly. And let that inform the discussions we're having with the Board. And to the extent that the results can lead us there, that\u2019s one thing. But we're not going to be chasing peers. It's not a race to the lowest possible capital ratio necessarily. It's trying to have the right amount. And I think especially this -- for we, probably should be at least in the cycle. It's hard to know maybe where we are kind of an uncharted waters in terms of what these recoveries looked like, but we certainly don't want to go into a down turn. In the -- kind of behind the pack and so that's how we are thinking about it. We're really fundamentally going to use kind of stress testing to inform how we discuss it with the Board. But I think at the present time, we see enough room to get down to pretty close to where kind of the peer median is.","Dave Rochester","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good afternoon,","Harris Simmons","Hi, John.","John Pancari","On the loan growth front in terms of your guidance and I know that you softened it a bit there. Could you give us just a little more clarity around what you're actually seeing that that\u2019s driving you to push that lever, like what type of competitive pressures on terms and pricing and then what types of portfolios are you seeing that happen? Thanks.","Harris Simmons","I will just -- I will give you an example that I\u2019ve heard just a couple of -- obviously in the last week, over in Colorado. I heard -- I was being told about a 3-year, its $30 million commercial real estate deal that went to the CMBS market, it's 10 years interest only, covenant light kind of deal and it's just not -- that\u2019s now what we are going to play. And so that -- that\u2019s -- that would be an example. I don\u2019t know Michael, if you have any other comments about that?","Michael Morris","Well, sometimes with owner occupied, you don't really know what industries are that are growing, but owner occupied is a focus for the company. We like what comes with it in terms of ancillary business and relationship\/ so. And we're very pleased to see that category grow.","John Pancari","Okay.","Scott McLean","John, this is Scott. I just add that I -- the area of our portfolio or activities that\u2019s the most volatile really it's the larger transactions like the CRE term credit, CRE term credit that Harris described. And we'll see at the end of the large energy credits. Also which had experienced more pay offs than we anticipated there. But generally it's just some remaining problem credits that are paying down, so that\u2019s actually a good thing. But as you know, we don\u2019t have a big exposure to larger loans, but the exposure we do have is just more volatile because of the conditions that have been described. If you look at slide 20 in the deck, what you see is really solid growth year-over-year, and a real bright spot is our smaller affiliates in Colorado, Arizona, Commerzbank in Washington and Nevada. They represent about 25% of the company and they\u2019re producing about 5O% the loan growth. So that's really a healthy thing. And as Michael noted, by loan type, owner occupied is C&I and collectively that's growing nicely. Our mortgage related business whether it's one to four family or the HELOC portfolio are growing nicely. And then we're actually seeing some growth coming from energy again, so it's a nice mix of loans by type and it's coming broadly across the company, particularly from our smaller affiliates.","John Pancari","Got it. Thanks, Scott. That\u2019s help. Now that leads you right into my second question. I mean, given that can change? I mean, to get your loan growth back up here, because obviously given nothing -- a short of a downturn in the credit cycle -- I\u2019m not sure that the competitive environment really changes here. So if we assume that the competitive environment remains relatively intense, is there any reason to expect your loan growth can strengthen from here.","Scott McLean","I think it's hard to know. The third quarter was a good solid quarter for us and fourth-quarter generally is a good quarter. So it's hard to know. I think the reason we lightened our guidance just a little bit is because of the volatility in these larger loan transactions, they\u2019re just lumpier. And that that's I think what we were trying to say.","John Pancari","I get it. Thank you. And we favor the better credit anyway. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open","Ken Zerbe","Great.. Thanks. I guess, the first question in terms of your average balances on the liability side, looks like you paid down a fair amount borrowed funds in the quarter, called maybe $800 million, $900 million. Can you just remind us like what that is. And should that borrowed fund stay relatively constant, just given the more moderate pace of asset growth?","Paul Burdiss","No, yes, this is Paul, Ken. Just -- we use that as a balancing mechanism of the balance sheet as we think about overall kind of loan growth and what we are doing with the investment portfolio, that ends up -- and then what deposits are doing in stability and growth of deposit, that ends up being kind of the balancing component there. So that number is really just going to be, if it makes sense, kind of what it needs to be. A lot of that as you know are home loan bank borrowings, we're becoming more active in the senior note market. You saw that issuance this past quarter. And so I would expect to see the composition of that funding change over time similar to what you saw here over the last quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay. Perfect. And then just as a follow-up question separately, can you just remind us how big is the municipal loan portfolio right now? And kind of what are your designs on growth in that over time? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, right. As you can see it actually on Slide -- Page 12 of our press release. Currently municipal loan portfolio is about $1.5 billion. That's grown from about a $1 billion a year-ago.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay.","Paul Burdiss","And we are going to continue to expect to see growth as we invest in that business.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Understood. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning, good afternoon for other. Sorry about that. Just wanted to ask a follow-up question to John's line of questioning. I guess, as we think about where the non-banks aren't playing, how would you help us size your portfolio in terms of what you think is more -- a more defensible business from the non-banks, whether it's the municipalities or owner occupied or part of your real estate portfolio?","Harris Simmons","I guess I would say that -- I think we are relatively speaking in a pretty good place, because we have a significant portion of our portfolios in generally smaller credits. I mean, we are not a big corporate banking player. So and even with the municipal -- these municipal credits we are trying to focus on, kind of smaller municipalities where we think we can actually create little more value for them and for us. And owner occupied is a lot of what we do there is kind of small to midsize businesses. And that's certainly true of what our C&I portfolio generally. And I think those are reasonably -- its really a pretty good place on deals that are kind of $1 million to $5 million or $6 million or $7 million. Don't tend to find them their way into loan funds. They don't tend to get picked up by online lenders etcetera. They are really our competitors, they\u2019re largely community banks and other regional banks.","James Abbott"," Erika, this is James Abbott. I -- we do have some slides in our Investor Day materials back from March that give you kind of sense of the size of the commercial loan portfolios. So the small loans versus the medium-sized and large-sized loan, so that\u2019s a resource that you could potentially utilize, but we do have a very substantial portion of our C&I portfolio for example is loans that are less than $5 million in balance, And we did see very good growth out of that during the quarter, linked quarter annualized little over 4% was very strong performance, while some of the larger stuff did decline.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a follow-up on the color that you provided with regards to margin expectations going forward. We hear you loud and clear on the deposit side. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a sense on what spreads are looking like right now and whether or not sort of the lower burden as a non-SIFI changes your strategy about securities or investment?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Erika, this is Paul. So that is a lot in there. Deposit beta we talked about maybe don\u2019t need to get into that too much more. Loan spreads have been generally behaving, keeping in mind sort of where we operate and your conversation about kind of the average size of loans that has impacted our ability to fund loan spreads. Although I will see the composition of the portfolio exchange a little bit. So for example, if you looking at our portfolio from year-ago, we had more commercial real estate relative to residential mortgage than we do today. And the spread as you know kind of the spread in that just two examples or maybe one combination example, but the spread is very different among this products, residential mortgage having a tighter spread. So while generally on a deal by deal basis, we had some success maintaining into pending spreads, we are seeing a slightly different composition of the portfolio, which is impacting overall loan spreads. As it relates to the size of the investment portfolio, while it's true that we are no longer subject to the LCR, our biggest constraint really is our liquidity stress testing as oppose to the LCR. So I am not forecasting or we\u2019re not predict a big change in the composition or investment portfolio because that liquidity stress testing continues to be a really important part of the way we're managing our balance sheet. So overall as I said in my prepared remarks, we've had -- if I can use the term a pretty decent relative to expectations, a pretty decent net interest margin beta. As you know, we\u2019ve got a slide back in the -- bought back in the appendix that provides a little more detail on the interest sensitivity, particularly, the asset side of the book relative to market rate. And our performance has been very much in line with our modeling and our expectation. Looking ahead again, considering deposit beta is another thing. Maybe we don\u2019t squeeze as many basis points out of a fed tightening as we have over the past kind of year and half. But we expect to continue to for the modest margin expansion as the federal reserve continues to raise rates.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Paul Burdiss","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question jumps from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Just a follow-up on the deposit side. I noticed you had good year-over-year growth of 3% and non interest bearings were actually stable, so even amidst this, deposit pricing pressure, we are seeing -- can you just give us a little color in terms of where you're getting that incremental growth from and your continued belief in the stability especially of that non-interest-bearing where we are sorting to see that, really come down a lot other peers. Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Ken this is Paul. I will start and Harris and Scott can build in. But if you go back to our Investor Day, we talked a lot about the composition of our deposit book. And the fact that it's very granular, very operating in nature. This is -- if you think about deposits in terms of operating deposits and kind of core to core investment deposits, our proportion of those operating deposits is actually pretty high. All that being said, the stickiness of our DDA is actually been sort of a pleasant surprise for me. I want that to sound negative, but our interest rate risk modeling actually anticipates that we will have more migration out of DDA than we\u2019ve experienced. But I think the fact that our DDA has been so sticky really an indication of the strength of the deposit base and kind of overall strength that provides the organization.","Ken Usdin","And as follow-up, Paul \u2026","Harris Simmons","All right. Go ahead.","Scott McLean","s","This is Scott. I would just add to that our ratio of non-interest bearing deposits, the total deposits for decades, several decades has been almost industry-leading we're sitting at 45%. Today most of our peers are in the kind of mid to low 30s, , high 20s, but even before 2008 our relationship of non-interest bearing to interest -- to total deposits was, was very favorable and it's for the reason that Paul described, but I just add some fluctuation to that. About 65% of our 24 day products, which just reinforces the point that these are operating balances of these businesses, And they\u2019re generally smaller businesses and what I would suggest is -- generally these are company -- smaller company and they\u2019re focused totally on how to enhance their gross profit mar margins which maybe 15% to 30% percent as opposed to had to get an extra 25 basis points out of there. They are operating account.","Ken Usdin","Makes sense. Thanks, Scott and these are the follow-up to that. Can you detail just is it the consumer side versus the corporate that's been growing, because there is also been a lot of talk about the stickiness of consumer not as much of a focus for you guys. But a big part of the bank it is, so what side of the bank is growing into when it comes to deposit for you guys. Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, it's been -- they\u2019re mostly non personnel, so it's a commercial deposits.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. So it feeds to Scott's point. Thanks a lot.","Scott McLean","Right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, everybody. Want to start, Paul, -- for Paul at expenses. You did seem to be running at the low end of the 2% to 3% range that you previously talked about. Do you think that\u2019s sustainable going forward?","Harris Simmons","Look we are and have been really investing in our business. And I\u2019m really proud that -- the organization has really come together and we are creating opportunities to change, if you will, kind of the composition of the way that we're investing in the business. So we are saving money in spot and we're investing money in other spots. As we look ahead and just kind of 2019 and beyond, we are right in the middle of our budgeting process. We are very focused on expense control, we are very focused on positive operating leverage. And so, yes, in the near-term I absolutely think its sustainable.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, great. And then just one other one for Harris. Given the valuation of Zions stock here and now that you're officially out of CCAR. Do you have an appetite, as we with the board, you're the Chairman of the board obviously to accelerate buybacks and get to the targets more quickly?","Harris Simmons","Yes, I do. I\u2019m one vote out of -- 11 or rather. So I -- it's -- again, I don\u2019t want to front run that conversation, but I think that I mean clearly valuation is one of the things we need to think about. It's a silver lining to what I am seeing in stock market these days is the fact we\u2019ve got a lot of capital to deal with. So I tell I am thinking about.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jennifer Demba","Thank you. Can you hear me?","Harris Simmons","Yes. Hi, Jennifer.","Jennifer Demba","Hi. Harris, just wondering if you can talk about the level of lending competition you are seeing and kind of compare and contrast that to what we saw right before the last downturn?","Harris Simmons","Well, I think there's a whole lot of -- still a lot of liquidity out there, a lot of cash and it's very competitive for earning assets. I don\u2019t know quite how to compare it to before the last downturn. I mean, that was I think clearly more housing kind of driven a lot of demand for developer credit. And so -- and I think there's actually quite a lot of discipline today around that, not only here, but generally I think we see around the industry. So I think in that respect, it's probably fundamentally different, but you are seeing a lot of -- there's been a lot of growth, you see it's not quite so much where we play is in leverage lending, but clearly big players there, using a lot of competitive pressure from hedge funds and loan funds and others that are I think should be maybe of some concern in terms of kind of where the next problems could pop up.","Ed Schreiber","This is Ed Schreiber. I wanted to supplement some of Harris' comments, but more importantly look at our book when you really look at what we've done over the last few years, the balance sheet has been simplified, but more importantly on the credit side, with Michael Morris, the Chief Credit Officer and his staff, we\u2019ve really designed a program here that you've seen and exemplified through the oil and gas cycle, that we are really a big fan about positioning the company as a positive outlier through the next cycle. So if you look at -- really looking at any forecast and I think the way we position the Company from an asset quality perspective is that we are in a good shape and we'd be a positive outlier through this next cycle.","Jennifer Demba","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. First, just a little clarification. I think in the prepared remarks -- excuse me, in the prepared remarks you touched on the impact of the simplification of the corporate structure on expenses. Can you remind us what the benefit is you expect from that? How do you quantify that?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I didn't specifically quantify it. Geoff, this is Paul. I didn't specifically quantify it, but what I did say effectively was that we\u2019ve seen some escalation or elevation in the professional services line over the course of the last kind of near-term and that we'd expect that -- maybe the run rate of that to be a little bit lower. That was kind of a key -- I would say the key part of the prepared remarks, I think to deal with what you are describing. Keep in mind that we did not have a lot that happened at the holding company. Nearly all of the assets and essentially all of the operations and all the employees have been at the bank level for some time. So while it does create organizational simplification, my expectation is not that we would see a kind of step wise change in our operating kind of expenses.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then on the deposit side, I guess you're somewhat unusual in operating separate brands and separate banks, if you like, in different geographies. How much flexibility is that giving you to adjust pricing in different markets and how much variation you are seeing in competition if you kind of compare the main markets you\u2019re in?","Harris Simmons","Well, we price locally. We -- the pricing decisions about deposits are made by local management teams and they certainly have incentives to try to minimize their funding costs. But -- so we\u2019ve internal transfer pricing as every large -- larger bank would have to compensate them for the funds that they\u2019re raising and they're trying to make spread on both sides of the balance sheet. I don\u2019t know what more I could probably say about it.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I would -- this is Paul. If I could, I would probably ascribe more value to sort of the local nature of the banks as opposed to the local brand of the banks. Your question was really around the brand, but I think the value is really around the way we run in the autonomy of the local groups and being able to react specifically to what the client needs at a very, very local level, I think is providing a lot of flexibility for us as we are thinking about deposit pricing.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thanks very much.","Paul Burdiss","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Spahr","Thanks for taking the question. With high single-digit PPNR, how low do you think the efficiency ratio can go?","Harris Simmons","I don\u2019t know, it sounds like a game of limbo.","Paul Burdiss","I will just start out in that.","Harris Simmons","Scott [indiscernible].","Paul Burdiss","As I said we are really focused not necessarily on efficiency ratio as the -- that sort of the end goal. We are really focused on positive operating leverage. And if we can continue to achieve that, we\u2019re going to continue to see very strong PPNR growth and continue to grind that efficiency ratio lower.","Harris Simmons","I would make one observation, because we\u2019ve talked a lot about the deposit base and kind of in the loan mix and it is a little different than you find in some of our peers and it is a little more expensive to operate and we'd hope that shows up in the form of the kind of deposit performance we shown here -- you are seeing right now. But that -- so that probably creates a little bit of drag, but I think nevertheless we are -- my hope would be that we find ourselves getting down into the kind of the mid 50s over the next couple of years, that would be just kind of generally my aspiration.","Scott McLean","I would -- I just add to that, this is Scott, that going back to Steven's questions about the expense growth rate of 2%, 3%, I mean, basically we\u2019re building our plan around that expense trajectory that we\u2019ve talked about and that involves investing actively in the businesses that we are trying to grow and investing actively in technology. And so we are not just sitting back cutting costs everywhere and not investing in the future. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in the future over the last three or four years, both in terms of technology and in terms of businesses we are trying to grow with hiring new bankers etcetera, etcetera.","Christopher Spahr","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.","Steve Moss","Good afternoon. On the loan growth front with particular on resi and also on oil and gas, just wondering what are your thoughts for growth going forward in both those categories, and also what are you retaining with regard to resi mortgages these days?","Scott McLean","Yes, I \u2026","Paul Burdiss","Go ahead, Scott.","Scott McLean","Go ahead, Paul. Well, I was just going to say, our mortgage business is very different than the mortgage business you would find at the major mortgage lenders in the country. Our business is basically a private banking business, although we do have a very broad consumer business also, but it basically is -- about 50% of our mortgages are for small business owners, our small business owners, and I think they're going to be -- and they're generally not first time home buyers. So our mortgage volume is down a little bit this year versus last year, but not nearly like the rest of the industry that you read about in the paper every day. So we are pretty bullish on our mortgage business and we retained about, Paul, I think it's about 60%, 70% of what we originate, we are basically retaining everything under 10 years. And we are about to introduce a new online digital application process that we think is going to be a real game changer for us. We are not a big player, but a game changer for us. And that\u2019s in pilot right now, will be rolling out next year. And on the energy book, it's about $2.2 billion in outstandings right now. It got down to about $2 billion, went from $3 billion to $2 billion, that was the contraction. Just in the last couple of quarters it's grown back to about $2.2 billion. And I think 10% to 15% kind of growth in that portfolio would not be unusual at all. It's basically reserve base lending and midstream. There's virtually no growth coming from our services business. And we have contracted -- we\u2019ve consciously held back in that area.","Steve Moss","Okay. That's helpful. And then, with regard to securities balances here, I know on EOP basis, they're flat. Just wondering what are your expectations for those balances going forward.","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. I am not expecting a big change in the size or the composition, although that may change as deposit growth ebbs and flows and loan growth ebbs and flows. But generally speaking I expect that portfolio to remain relatively stable, its overall size.","Steve Moss","All right, thank you very much.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. I have three quick questions. One is the warrants that were outstanding were causing some dilution as the stock price was going up. The share count dropped pretty precipitously this quarter, was some of that the benefit of the kind of reversing out of some of that impact?","Harris Simmons","Some of -- this quarter I think if you look at average share price quarter-over-quarter, even though it maybe went up and went down, I don't know that the average is a whole lot different. I think a lot of the positive impact there -- you are seeing there's the result of the share repurchase activity.","Paul Burdiss","I think in the quarter, Marty, it's about 0.5 million shares is all the difference that you read, but obviously we will have to see what the stock price does in the fourth quarter here, but if it stays where it is, it will be a more substantial improvement on diluted shares.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then, Paul, you were talking about the FDIC costs and I was kind of hearing that because you had consolidated and you've done some debt, that maybe your FDIC costs are just going to go down without kind of the surcharge going away. Could you just maybe explain just the number, what it was this quarter, next quarter, and what do you expect it to be kind of as that rolls forward?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, Marty. I probably wasn't as it articulated, I could have been as I went through that part of the prepared remarks, but you are right. There are couple of things impacting FDIC this quarter. The key one is we had sort of this incremental accrual of $3.7 million that shows up in the third quarter, but it was kind of a, if I can use the term, sort of a one-time thing, it's isolated event, it's not going to happen again next quarter. The other aspect is we issued unsecured debt in the third quarter and then we had a little bit of debt that was holding company notes that have now been assumed by the bank. So as you know unsecured debt, it gets a favorable -- very favorable treatment under the FDIC calculator. And so there's also going to be an incremental benefit of that and that\u2019s probably going to be close to a $1 million a quarter. The other big one of course is the FDIC surcharge, that will affect us as it affects everyone else. And just as a reminder, for us that FDIC surcharge is a little under $6 million a quarter.","Marty Mosby","Perfect. And then the last quick question is, your biggest portfolio is C&I, excluding oil and gas, and it's declining, so it's tough to see the momentum building in the portfolio without one still kind of seeing a modest decline. Almost all of that decline, back on page 20, is coming out of Amegy. So I was just curious what was the loan type or the decisioning around because it was a big number in this quarter, but it was actually it looks like it's been consistent over the past several quarters. So just curious what was causing that decline.","Paul Burdiss","So I will start and then I will ask Scott and Michael and whoever else want to make a comment. Marty, when thinking about C&I, I would also include owner occupied in that. I think owner occupied is a really important aspect. It just, as you know, happens to be secured by commercial real estate, but it's really sort of a commercial loan, disguised as a commercial real estate loan because it's owner occupied. But -- if you combine C&I and owner occupied, there actually had been growth over the course of the last year. So, Scott or Michael, would you like to add anything of that?","Scott McLean","No. I would just -- I would echo what you said, but I would also point to Amegy's growth in owner occupied. So there has been growth in the Texas market in C&I and we always include owner occupied under the C&I umbrella as Paul mentioned.","Michael Morris","And the only thing I would add to that is that, that portfolio is -- it has more exposure to larger transactions than most of our other portfolios. So in the C&I space -- so the volatility, we talked about earlier in the call, Amegy is a place you will definitely see it in that C&I non oil and gas, exactly, right.","Marty Mosby","Right. Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Koch with Koch Investments. Your line is open.","Donald Koch","Hey, thank you, guys. Just sort of had a bang up quarter. I am just sort of flexed [ph]. I mean it's an outstanding quarter. I am looking at your slides from your Investor Day and your main bank is a little less than the third of total bank assets. Are you finding that there's some kind of fall out. I know historically when you do these consolidations like Regions did and Synovus and the old Barnet and UCBI, it takes several quarters for those Directors to sort of come back to the family and the salary mechanism of individual banks versus one bank all working out. And I mean can you make these statements about why you did so well in the quarter? So, really outstanding, but yet the stock sort ought to be filled.","Harris Simmons","You broke up in the last phrase there.","Donald Koch","And why did -- if I were to be a betting man, I would have bet that the stock in the last quarter would have currently gone up from your phenomenal numbers. I mean, you are knocking the stocks off the ROA and the ROE, but there's such tremendous pressure, downward pressure stock from this consolidation. Do you have any explanation on that? ","Harris Simmons","Well, I don\u2019t know if it was from the consolidation. I would say it's tough enough to manage a bank without having to manage the market.","Donald Koch","Right. No, no I understand. I know and it's a guess, but are you seeing any fallout from the individual that were part of these individual banks that you all put together?","Harris Simmons","No, I mean, listen, I think the -- fundamentally the answer is, no. I mean, we had, we have -- I mean we\u2019ve got enough employees on any given day. We got people get picked off by others, we sometimes pick up other people as well. But there's been very stable kind of in the management ranks of the company has been very stable.","Donald Koch","And so they\u2019re paid the same way and the incentives are the same?","Harris Simmons","Yes, fundamentally there hasn't been a lot of change there. All the front -- the customer facing employees in this Company fundamentally, almost all of them, not totally, but most all of them report to these local market CEOs.","Donald Koch","Right.","Harris Simmons","What we call these affiliate CEOs. And that group has been extremely stable. So, I don't think that that\u2019s -- we just haven't seen the kinds of issues you see going through this. The consolidation was not a huge deal for the customer facing people. Now it had some impact certainly in kind of some back office functions, places like that, but the revenue drivers, we tried to be pretty careful about those.","James Abbott","In fact -- this is James, I will just jump in here. We\u2019ve got just a couple of minutes left. And I'd say, one that Harris, you've said many times in the conference appearances, we made this decision to consolidate because of the feedback we're getting from the frontline employees to helping their lives simpler. Let's just take -- we are not going to be able to make everybody's questions and it looks like because of time, but let's just take two more questions and we will go lightening around for these last two and then we will be at our time limit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lana Chan of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Lana Chan","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on the capital return discussion. Could you talk about your appetite for acquisitions whether whole bank or loan portfolios or business lines?","Harris Simmons","Well, I think we've said for some time, we never say never. It's not something that it is not a strategic priority of any sense. We will be opportunistic, I guess, if something was a great fit. But it's not something that we spend a lot of time thinking about.","James Abbott","Thanks, Lana.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Your line is open.","Brock Vandervliet","Thanks very much, I had of jump off for a while. Harris, I thought I heard you mention 55 or mid 50s, I guess, efficiency ratio, it doesn't seem like that would be necessarily in the near-term anyway top line driven. Are you feeling better about the scope for expense saves here on the back of some of the charter consolidation or vis-\u00e0-vis your improvement in terms of your regulatory situation?","Harris Simmons","Well, when I just talk about mid 50s, I used the word aspirational and I am not suggesting that\u2019s going to happen in the next few quarters. But I think I do think that that's achievable with kind of our business model and with -- if the economy continues to remain reasonably healthy, I think that -- I do think that that\u2019s -- that we will continue to see revenue growth driven by kind of reasonable loan growth. I think we worry a little in the short run about competitive pressures on some of the larger deals as we mentioned. But that's not fundamentally what our major part of this franchise is. And so I think over time as we continue to focus on what I think our sweet spot is, I think it's not an unreasonable kind of goal.","Brock Vandervliet","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","James Abbott","Okay. I think -- this is James Abbott. We appreciate -- thank you Latif for hosting the question-and-answer session. Thank you all for joining the call today. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me if you have additional questions or comments. My information is on the front of the press release.

This call is being recorded. I will now turn the time over to James Abbott. Please go ahead.","James Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications","Thank you. And we welcome you to this conference call to discuss our second quarter of 2014 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During that section, we ask you to limit your question to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?","Harris Simmons - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, James and we welcome you to the call today. We continue to make substantial progress on a variety of fronts, including credit quality, certain elements of fee income, generally stable net interest margin and net interest income. We are also making solid progress on efforts that are taking place behind the scenes, including the ongoing and significant upgrade to our risk and credit management practices, which is a process that has been going on for sometime now since it\u2019s a crisis and an area where great progress has been made, but there is always more to do.","A key challenge for Zions is holding the expense level at or near current levels at a time when the current interest rate environment has placed the pressure on net interest margins across the industry. And when the systems need to be replaced and we continue to need to invest to meet increasing compliance, stress testing and other regulatory requirements. Although all banks face the spread compression challenge, Zions is somewhat more sensitive to his pressure than some of the nation\u2019s largest banks, because spread income is a larger portion of our total income statement or total revenue.","Turning to the financial results for the quarter. Net interest income, excluding the income from FDIC indemnified loans, increased about $7 million or about 2%. As we have guided in the past, loan growth and reduced debt expense acted as offsets to natural pressures from loan pricing pressure and the declining source of earnings from loans purchased from the FDIC back in 2009 are so-called covered loans. With regard to loan yield pressure, the primary challenge has been new loans coming on at yields that are below those of loans that are rolling off. The competitive pricing environment has been difficult for all banks, although in many of our markets and lending types, we are experiencing some stability in marginal pricing.","Regarding volume, we experienced healthy average and period end loan growth in the second quarter and origination volume increased slightly over the same period a year ago, up about 2%. Our managers and those involved in our small business lending are seeing improved demand and higher approval rates in their \u2013 in this particular area of small business. And middle-market commercial and industrial and consumer demand remains reasonably healthy. Commercial real estate lending demand in our markets is reasonably strong. Although as we have discussed in this forum in the past, we are limiting our growth in commercial real estate as part of our concentration risk management practices as well as the very high capital requirements, when you consider the capital required to support such loans for those of us that are subject to Dodd-Frank Act stress tests.","We are hearing from our lenders that some of the other large bank competitors in our markets are backing away from the loan type that receives the most significant losses in the stress test, in this case, the construction and land development category. So, we probably are not alone in this redirection of capital allocation. Although Zions construction and development loan balances grew in the second quarter, commitments declined. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged on the whole and that is for slightly to moderately increasing loan volumes.","Credit quality is strong and the trends are generally stable to improving. Our loan net charge-off ratio remains one of the best in the industry at 6 basis points and total loans on an annualized basis. Non-performing assets improved by about 14% from the prior quarter and equaled 95 basis points of loans and REO the first time it\u2019s fallen below 1% since 2007. Classified loans declined about 5% in the quarter.","With respect to capital, our GAAP common equity capital ratios increased compared to the prior quarter with a tangible common equity ratio rising to 8.6% from 8.2% last quarter, primarily due to the cancellation of our total return swap on our collateralized debt obligation portfolio. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I declined about 14 basis points to 10.42%, which is in line with information I previously communicated to you. Finally, let me note that I suspect that many of you are anxious to know more about the Federal Reserve review of Zion\u2019s stress test and capital plan resubmission. As indicated in our 8-K filed on July 14, we currently expect Federal Reserve to provide a response to our resubmitted capital plan by July 28.","With that overview, I will now ask Doyle to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?","Doyle Arnold - Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Harris. Good afternoon everyone. A brief overview for the second quarter 2014, Zion\u2019s posted net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $104.5 million or $0.56 per diluted common share. This compares to net earnings applicable to common of $76.2 million in the prior quarter or $0.41 per diluted common share. There were kind of two big swing items between the quarters. First, recall that first quarter results included a net $31 million pretax gain on fixed income securities that resulted from CDO sales that we did that quarter. That added about $0.10 per share to earnings in that quarter and a higher preferred dividend level that quarter reduced earnings by about $0.05 a share.","The other big swing is in the second quarter due to continued strong improvements in credit quality that was referenced by Harris earlier we had a net negative provision for the combined \u2013 combination of funded and unfunded lending commitments of approximately $448 million negative. There is one other much smaller item that some of you will want to be aware of. We have a one-time or specific tax accrual of about $2.3 million or $0.01 a share this quarter related to some older tax years which we do not expect to be included in the tax line going forward.","Now, I will move on to a brief review of some of the key revenue drivers. Average loans held for investment increased $419 million compared to the prior quarter. Period end loans held for investment increased a similar amount $432 million. The primary increases were driven then by commercial and industrial loans of $293 million and consumer loans primarily residential mortgages of $103 million.","We are experiencing loan growth in July and expected to continue based on reports from various lending groups. But as kind of indicated in Harris\u2019 opening remarks, we are constraining loan growth in some cases by self imposed risk concentration limits particularly on some types of commercial real estate loans. If we did not have these risk management limits, but we do, loan growth rates would be stronger as there is demand out there. In part because of the concentration limits we were able to be more selective on the deals that we do accept and it enables us to be somewhat slower to cut pricing or to loosen underwriting standards when we encounter that kind of market price pressure.","I also mentioned here that the increase in construction land development loans in the second quarter were solely attributable to draws on existing lines. By design, we slightly reduced C&D commitments in the second quarter and trying to continue to at least in the near-term constrain C&D commitment growth given the very significant equity requirement on such loans in the CCAR stress test process. We are encouraged by recent reports that the outlook for capital expenditure for both large and small businesses appears to be on the rise. The managers of our small business lending units are notably more optimistic about loan growth in that space. And in some markets such borrowers are becoming more active. Managers of larger C&I credits report that customer optimism is about the same as it was a few months ago. And then in that area, our pipelines are generally stable with levels back in March. Managers of commercial real estate products are reporting the market remains quite robust, although there is generally less demand for new multi-family construction than in the past.","Turning to new production volume, that increased approximately 2% from a year ago. We are encouraged that pricing on new loan production has remained essentially stable for the last four quarters. The yield on the loan portfolio, excluding the FDIC supported loans, declined only 2 basis points in the second quarter to 4.28% from 4.30% in the prior quarter. The coupon on new production does remain below the weighted average coupon rate of the existing portfolio however. Therefore, we do expect additional compression for the next several quarters. Although as the portfolio yield converges with the production yield, the rate of compression should moderate. Line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans were up slightly to about 33% from 32% in the prior quarter. Small C&I loans defined as commitments less than $5 million accounted for the increase, where the utilization rate of 40% this quarter, up from 39% in the prior quarter.","Let me discuss for a moment the FDIC supported loans and the income from that source as I have done in the past. We continue to experience quite strong performance on the loans in this portfolio. Payoff amounts and recoveries are in excess of estimates used in previous cash flow analyses, which are updated quarterly. Such pay-off and recovery activity results in accelerated income and enhanced yield of FDIC supported and other purchase credit impaired loans. Such loans yield at an annualized 23% for the second quarter, which was very strong, but albeit down from 29% in the first quarter or about $16 million of total interest income. That\u2019s about 3% of total interest income, yet the loans represent just 0.5% of total interest earning assets.","At the beginning of this year, we expected the total remaining income from the portfolio to be roughly $80 million. The substantial majority of which would be recognized by the end of next year that is 2015. The updated number now is approximately $100 million, of which about $39 million has been recognized in the first half of the year. Current expectation is for roughly $15 million for the remainder of 2014 between $15 million and $20 million in 2015 with the remaining accretion expected to occur in years after that. However, these estimates are subject to revisions that may continue to be significant depending upon basically the underlying strength of the market for the disposition of loans and recoveries on loans in that portfolio.","The indemnification asset expense related to this loan book, which is recognized as a component of other non-interest expense equaled $9 million for the quarter, down from $16 million in the prior quarter and should amount to a total of about $6 million in the third quarter. And going into periods beyond the third quarter, if FDIC supported loan cash flows exceed our current forecast, we will recognize additional both revenue in the form of interest income and the related expense in the other non-interest expense line, the revenue will exceed the expense, however, kind of no matter what, just the amounts of both may vary. For example, if we experienced $10 million of cash flow in excess of our current forecast over several quarters, we would recognize $10 million of interest income over that timeframe and about $8 million of non-interest expense over the same timeframe which is the FDIC\u2019s portion of the cash flow. I wish we didn\u2019t talk so long about that item but I know it\u2019s a source of noise that some of you try to back out of your estimates.","So we will move \u2013 now move on to the overall margin and net interest income. Turning to the net interest margin on Page 13 of the release you will note that the NIM declined two basis points compared to the prior quarter. Looking at the primary drivers reduced income from the just discussed FDIC supported loans reduced the NIM by about six basis points and lower income from available-for-sale securities reduced it by about three. But offsetting this, a lower balance in cost of long-term debt enhanced demand by about three basis points. And the change in the mix of the asset base higher balance of loans and a reduced the balance of cash provided about four basis points of NIM support.","As previously mentioned the yield on loans declined two basis points to 4.28% from 4.30% in the prior quarter. Yield on commercial loans was very stable compared to prior quarter 4.3% versus 4.29% last quarter, as of the consumer portfolio 4.07% versus 4.09%. The loan type showing the most significant compression was the construction and land development portfolio which declined to 4.33% from 4.63% or 30 basis points. And the yields on those types of loans are fairly similar to those in the C&I portfolio at this point.","On Page 9, total net interest income was $416 million, which was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter and I think in line with the guidance that we have been giving you throughout the quarter. Although we ceased building a core net interest or providing a core net interest income we have committed to giving you components so that you could continue to calculate it if you wish to do so. And we will do so for the remainder of this year. The additional accretion on FDIC supported loans is found on the table, bottom of Page 9. It equaled about $11.7 million. The discount amortization on subordinated debt was $6.5 million. Adjusting for these factors there was about $5 million linked quarter increase in net interest income. The net interest margin if one adjusted for these factors actually increased slightly.","Turning now to non-interest income on Page 7, after we and many other banks experienced a very soft first quarter in fee income ours and some others bounced back a bit here in the second quarter, other service charges, commissions and fees in particular increased to $47.5 million, up from $43.5 million in the prior quarter and compared to year ago period is up about 3.5%. Much of the increase is due to our efforts to improve penetration of business credit cards. The fair value and non-hedged derivative income line increased by about $6 million to a negative $1.9 million from the prior quarter, this was primarily the result of the cancellation of the total return swap in late April which we advised you of both before and at that time. We do not expect any further contra revenues from that item in the future quarters.","Regarding fixed income security gain \u2013 securities gains, although we did not sell any CDOs in the second quarter, we recognized a gain of $5 million. This occurs when we have taken other than temporary and common charges in the past or if we purchased securities at a discount par in the past which we did when we bought those \u2013 some securities out of Lockhart Funding, our off-balance sheet QSPE back in the period 2007 to 2009. Anyway if those securities now payoff at par, they are paying off at a price that\u2019s higher than the market value. And this quarter, we received par value pay-downs of $24 million as seen on Page 8 of the release resulting in a gain of $5 million. We currently expect this to be an ongoing source of income although it maybe a bit sporadic in nature. Assuming the economy remains relatively stable our models indicate that we should receive almost all of the par value of the performing CDOs if we held them to maturity or about $60 million of gains.","Our models also indicate that we should end up recognizing values greater than amortized cost on non-performing CDOs, but it\u2019s substantially less than the par value of those CDOs. And the realization of that income would likely take many \u2013 being many years in the future assuming we continue to hold them for that long. Although we may hold these securities to realize some of the gains I just described, we may also elect to sell some of them from time-to-time in order to maximize our capital ratios under the stress testing process, a well-defined benefit today in exchange for a less certain benefit sometime in the future.","Finally, non-interest expense turning back to Page 7 most of the line items were fairly flat compared to the prior quarter, with three exceptions. Salaries and benefits increased by $5.4 million. Seasonal expense declines for payroll taxes were offset by an expense that occur seasonally every second quarter, which relates to stock grants to certain employees. Those, in fact, just so you understand the stock grants for employees who are eligible for retirement and would best continue to vest into retirement are expensed immediately, because effectively, the employee could elect to retire and have those grants fully vest over time. So, that\u2019s a pop that occurs when we make those annual grants in the second quarter.","Base salaries increased in part due to normal cost of living increases, but also as a result of increased staffing related to risk management compliance and the various systems replacement and enhancement projects that we announced a year ago. We have indicated that we are attempting to keep overall non-interest expense levels flat during this process. We expected salary levels in some professional services to increase to reflect this offset by declines in the indemnification asset expense and other credit-related costs. We are still staffing up for some of those projects and expenditures should increase somewhat over the next six quarters and then begin to decline in 2016.","Finally, I have already addressed the indemnification asset expense, which is contained in the other lines. If you strip out the indemnification expense, other non-interest expense increased only slightly compared to the prior quarter.","Let me wrap up now with summary of our outlook and guidance for the next year forward or so. Loan growth will remain \u2013 maintaining our slight to moderate growth outlook for loans over the one year horizon, although loans have continued to grow thus far in July, we don\u2019t expect third quarter growth to be quite as strong as the second quarter as we see it unfolding currently.","Net interest income on a GAAP basis, including the effect of the expected decline in interest income from the FDIC supported loans we expect to remain relatively stable. Pressure should come from further declines in those FDIC supported loan net interest income and as loans maturing that are replaced with loans at lower yield. As we get further out into 2014 and early \u201815, we expect that loan growth and higher cost, senior and subordinated debt payoffs will offset much of that pressure. Excluding the FDIC supported loan income we expect net interest income to increase slightly over the next year.","Non-interest income, we expect the less volatile components such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend as we push further into the mortgage space and enhance our treasury management product penetration. I mean for non-interest expense we \u2013 as I have mentioned we are attempting the hold non-interest expenses relatively stable at around $1.6 billion annually. We continue to hire for systems initiatives and regulatory and compliance-related jobs and expect our full-time equivalent employee base to increase by approximately 1% to 2% over the next year. Some of that \u2013 some of the expenses of those employees will be capitalized and somewhat offsetting the expense increases should be continued reduction in credit related expense and FDIC indemnification asset expense amortization.","During the provision expense, given our expectation of continued improvement in metrics that drive our ALLL methodology, we expect the provision expense to remain negative in the near-term. The current debt equity, I will just note that for those who are trying to figure out what to do with that line item, the first quarter\u2019s reserve release was probably a bit usually on the low side, while the second quarter\u2019s release was probably a bit on the high side if you are trying to \u2013 it probably somewhere in their brackets the target if you are trying to build a model. But I don\u2019t have any particular number in mind, I hasten \u2013 I must hasten to add that just trying to point the way things look. The tax rate as I mentioned was slightly elevated in the second quarter from that one item and we expected we will run a bit closer to 36% for the balance of the year. And finally deferred dividends should run around $15 million to $17 million per quarter.","With that I think we will wrap up the opening soliloquies and operator would you open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Hi, good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hi Brad.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Doyle, just want to ask about the balance sheet, some of the \u2013 you talked a lot about the reduction in cash, but looking at the deposit base, foreign deposits came down quite a bit in link quarter, can you talk a little bit about that and some of the movement you might see in the liquidity as you look out over the back half of the year, what your plans might be there, how they may have changed?","Doyle Arnold","We debated about whether to talk about deposits in the opening remarks and wait or wait for the question and the question is number one. So there were two \u2013 there were kind of two unusual items in deposits. One, is we closed a Cayman Islands branch which reduced the foreign deposits, but they were all re-booked domestically. So if you look at I believe it was mostly went into savings and now accounts, was it David. Savings and money market accounts, so that line item increased slightly, so that was just a shift. We did the next reduction in deposits of I think it was between $800 million to $900 million was driven primarily by the departure of one large institutional customer that we had \u2013 it was a college savings plan customer that we effectively no bid the renewal because it was costing more than deposits were worth. So and there was no other real relationship with that party. So it was a result of decision that we actually had plenty of liquidity and so we exited. That was our choice to exit that account. I will give you a chance to follow-on on that one if that was clear.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","No thanks. Maybe just to follow-up just in terms of liquidity, the $7.5 billion of money market on average I guess was down to a little more than $6 billion on a period end basis, any change in how you are going to manage that going forward?","Harris Simmons","No, I mean we are beginning to track against some of the new liquidity metrics that will become binding I think in January, particularly liquidity coverage ratio, we don\u2019t \u2013 the final rules are not yet published as you know, but as best we can calculate, we think we are in pretty good shape on that metric, but there is a lot less than $7.5 billion of true excess liquidity that we will have to hold a number of billions of dollars of liquidity in the form of cash or very low risk, very liquid assets like treasuries, for example, going forward anyway. So, I think the best outlook is that loan growth will continue to erode into that cash amount at an incremental rate, but there are no plans given the flatness and lowness of the yield curve to move a lot of that cash out. David, would you \u2013 anything you would like to add on that?","David Hemingway","No, I would agree with that.","Harris Simmons","Okay.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Harris Simmons","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harris Simmons","Hello, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Regarding the stress test, Harris in your prepared comments you indicated larger banks directing capital away from C&D loans, based on what you guys are seeing from this stress test is now resubmissioned, is there anything you had flagged for us as a change in the way you guys plan to run the business?","Harris Simmons","Well, I just \u2013 I mean I just underscore what both Doyle and I, I think said that is that one of the things we are certainly focused on is the capital consumed by construction and development. And so we are actively trying to manage down exposures there. Ultimately, it\u2019s a business that will always be in here in the west. It\u2019s an important line of business to us. And we may find other ways to conduct some of this business through and originate and sell kind of the model, but that in particular is a near-term focus. We are interested to see the results \u2013 our own results and those of the Federal Reserve in the 2015 CCAR exercise, that will probably provide some additional color to us in terms of how we are going to think about this, but we do understand that commercial real estate generally is consuming more capital than some of the other loan types in the context of stress tests. And so we are trying to think about that accordingly as we establish concentration limits.","Doyle Arnold","I just add if you go back to the Federal Reserve\u2019s published CCAR results for all the banks, the stress losses on commercial real estate loans were pretty high compared to other types. And while the Fed does not provide a breakdown between construction and development and term and owner-occupied, we and investment banks and consultants have all tried to estimate what that breakdown might be. And it looks like that construction and development are maybe doubled or more, the loss rates that the Fed published is for overall CRE, which makes it pretty painful from a capital utilization standpoint relative to as I mentioned pricing that has actually come down over time. And so that\u2019s what we are dealing with.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Maybe to follow up what\u2019s your annual spend running now tied to compliance-related cost as a CCAR bank and are you at a stage now where it sounds like you are still building on that, we shouldn\u2019t be thinking of any room for efficiencies here at least over the near-term?","Harris Simmons","Well, I think it\u2019s \u2013 this is Harris, but it\u2019s the slope of the line is leveling I think. I mean, it\u2019s not \u2013 we are not adding at the pace that we were two, three years ago, but it\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s actually something that I would be reluctant to try to nail down an actual cost. We have added, I mean the last time I tried to track this, we have added something over 300 full-time equivalent staff. This sort of this goes back about a year ago and that was over the prior couple of years, that numbers continued to grow, but not at the same pace. So if you read some of speeches by Federal Reserve governors particularly Governor Tarullo, lately he indicates publicly what we are experiencing directly which is the Fed\u2019s level of expectation, it does continue to grow \u2013 increase. And it would appear you have got another maybe another couple of years of continued heightened expectations. Well, not having to add as much staff to meet those expectations, just redeploy them into addressing the current year\u2019s level of top concerns is they are expressing to us in the industry. I don\u2019t know if that makes \u2013 if you follow that but that\u2019s we are all \u2013 they describe it as a glide path upward to a spot they want us all to get to.","Doyle Arnold","I would just \u2013 I would only say I mean heightened expectations I think is always going to be with us, that\u2019s just a new environment that I think all banks sort of find themselves in. I think in a couple of years that (Joel) is talking about is probably a couple of more years of some building spend. We also as we have talked about some of these big systems projects, we are becoming more encouraged as we get those in place that we will be able to see some savings and so we see some silver linings on the horizon.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Hello. Good afternoon.","Doyle Arnold","Hi Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","I guess I was just curious if you could give us any color on regional trends in loan growth this quarter?","Doyle Arnold","You want to talk about that James.","James Abbott","Yes. Joe this is James here. I would say we saw really the strongest growth came from the Amegy and the Utah banks. Utah had a very strong C&I growth in the quarter. On the small business front in Utah there was a lot of optimism today. Just really a good overall market I believe the unemployment rate in Utah is 3.6.","Doyle Arnold","3.5.","James Abbott","3.5 that is going, and so it\u2019s been very strong on those fronts. We saw a very good consumer loan growth across most of the franchise. So it really is pretty a broad based growth. And so I would just say that a couple of the areas that we did experience some attrition is on obviously on term commercial real estate. Some of that was in actually was across some of the several places in the footprint we did experience growth in construction and land development across about four or five of the affiliate banks. And but again the commitments have come down in virtually all of the affiliate banks compared to prior quarter.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I guess the other question is just a couple of things on expenses, I have recognized some of the finance bounce around, but provisions around funding commitments was up from last quarter to a slight recovery though the overall level of commitment seem like it was stable, so wondered what was going on there maybe something unusual last quarter. And then similarly with the elevated provision on legal services now that we are through the resubmissions, do you think we will start to see that level start to tail down a little bit?","Doyle Arnold","I would think in order provisions for unfunded lending commitments, is it gets moved around by a number of things. There were actually some very late quarter increases right at the end of the quarter increases in commitments last quarter that weren\u2019t picked up in our methodology. They were not deemed material but that added \u2013 basically it did add to the provision for unfunded commitments this quarter. We had a little bit of deterioration in one credit quality metric in a couple of loans, but there is no \u2013 I think the best thing I could tell you there is that overall in this environment, the growth \u2013 the provision for unfunded commitments ought to be somewhere around zero to a very small positive number with the driver being growth in new commitments or unfunded commitments driving the number to be positive and continued improvements, general improvements and credit quality pushing it back down towards zero.","On consulting and legal and whatnot, yes, the resubmission is in, but we like all bank sales, as I mentioned, a number of to do items from \u2013 as a result of the last CCAR \u2013 the Federal Reserve expects further qualitative improvements out of all banks and so we are spending to address those further improvements in our stress testing processes. I do think the rate of spend on that will be less this year than last and it should be less next year than this year.","Harris Simmons","And I\u2019d just note that, I mean, this quarter last year was $70.1 million, that\u2019s actually down $5 million from where it was in this quarter last year and that does reflect the fact that we\u2019re spending less on CCAR related pretty much, but it\u2019s going to be there probably for a while as we continue to refine that process.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.","Harris Simmons","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Hi, guys.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","I guess first question is just in terms of the small business demand, it seems like you guys have mentioned that small business demand has picked up or is picking up for last several quarters. How much of the loan growth this quarter actually came from what you defined as small businesses versus the larger businesses? And also when you are looking into what you are seeing in July sort of same question, what is being driven by small versus larger clients?","James Abbott","What we saw, we saw \u2013 Ken, this is James, we saw a pickup in the line utilization rate as mentioned in the press release and it\u2019s although it\u2019s small, it was a pickup, the commitment rate for large business has actually declined. Our syndicated credit balances declined on a linked quarter basis and so \u2013 and then in terms of overall production volume, it was up for small business. In terms of balances, I will have to get back to you after the call. I have got a sheet that\u2019s not with me here, but basically the smallest in the $1 million to $5 million size credits with the ones that definitely experienced some of the bigger increases in volume on the production side. And the optimization is definitely \u2013 is definitely there, it\u2019s \u2013 the approval rates on small business credit for example is probably up 10 to 15 percentage points compared to couple of years ago. And we are now in the 75%, 80% approval rates of those that are applying, so that\u2019s a meaningful increase over the past couple of years.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","And what that basically result from is their balance sheets and the income statements have kind of completed the heeling process from the deep recession and there is now built up two or three years of better financial performance that can be years to justify or lending?","Harris Simmons","I don\u2019t suggest, just a little footnote that is we were just named this last week as the recognized as largest SBA lender in the Houston, MSA which is a first for us after working at that for several years and for any of our people listening in it, they kudos for that, but I \u2013 that puts us kind of in a lending position in SBA production in Houston and in the state of Utah and up to Idaho, couple of the very best economies in the United States where we are really doing it, I think a really good job with SBA production and that\u2019s kind of a bellwether for all kinds of other small business loans that we are doing in these markets.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Got it, okay. And then a follow-up question just in terms of the potential equity raise after you hear back from the Fed, are you guys in a position that we could actually execute on the equity raise as soon as you hear back or just hoping to get an update on the timing of when that is likely to happen if you had also any thoughts on the form that, that might happen in terms of either dribble out or something else? Thanks.","Doyle Arnold","Yes. I think we are going to \u2013 we are just going to defer any discussion of the equity raise until there is one. If there is one and that won\u2019t \u2013 we won\u2019t be in a position to discuss that until after we have heard back from the Fed. We all want to avoid tripping over securities law issues about hiking a deal or anything like. So, let us talk that one please.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Fair enough. Alright, thank you much.","Operator","The next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.","Doyle Arnold","Hi, Jennifer.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson","Hi. Actually, Joe just took my question a second ago, I tried to queue out, but could you guys talk about \u2013 I think you have talked in the last few quarters you have talked about kind of bumping up against your concentration limits in certain categories, notably energy. Can you talk about where you are in that process right now?","Harris Simmons","Well, we have \u2013 under the limits we have in place, we still have some room. So, we are not \u2013 we are not ducking under the ceiling yet, but\u2026.","Doyle Arnold","We were phasing out the growth so that we can manage effectively concentrations and serve good customers.","Harris Simmons","Yes.","Doyle Arnold","Scott McLean sits here with us. So, we will let him.","Scott McLean","Sure. Jennifer, this is Scott. And the concentration limits really are not constraining at the moment. There is a lot \u2013 as you know, there is a lot of churn in the oilfield service business and in the reserve base business, in terms of private equity firms selling and repositioning their businesses. And so there is a lot of opportunity to be very active in both reserve base, midstream and oilfield service, while total outstanding, total commitments, they stay relatively constant. There is a lot of opportunity to generate additional income.","Harris Simmons","Yes. I think what I would say is that, I mean limits are, they are causing us to probably think twice about the kinds of \u2013 we are not just growing willy-nilly, but there is still room for kind of prudent growth there, but it\u2019s something we watch.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson","Thank you very much.","Doyle Arnold","Okay, Jennifer.","Operator","The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari - Evercore","Good afternoon guys.","Harris Simmons","Hi, John.","John Pancari - Evercore","On the CCAR front, just a couple of very quick questions there. Just want to see if you have any color on the Fed\u2019s extension request, which I am assuming you may not, but I figured I would ask? And then also on the PPNR differential between where you are expecting and then where you came out, wanted to see if you have got any additional color from the Fed on that front? And that\u2019s my main two things around the CCAR.","Doyle Arnold","Yes. I wish I could provide you color, but I think you heard from us consistently and others, that anything communications related to the whole stress testing in CCAR process, the Federal Reserve considers to be part of their supervisory process and supervisory communication and information sharing is confidential. So, I simply cannot provide you with any color. When we know something more definitive, we will \u2013 it would be material and we will have to say something publicly at that time. But in terms of sharing information about the process of getting to that definitive answer, I simply can\u2019t.","John Pancari - Evercore","Alright, that\u2019s fair. But I guess in the \u2013 you have mentioned your efforts to control your concentration risk, particularly as you are looking at commercial real estate and as you are doing that, I know you have talked about some considerations, including potential securitizations, potential CDS against your CRE underwriting. Can you talk to us what developments have you completed on that front? How far along the path are you in terms of developing your own securitization capability, how real is that opportunity?","Doyle Arnold","We continue to explore a number of options and there are some that are probably take longer to bring to fruition than other securitization probably falls into the \u2013 that\u2019s going to take us a little longer, I mean, may be year or two to really build up the capability and also the pipeline of loans that have all of the standard characteristics that the CMBS type market is looking for. We continue to work on those, but we are also looking at nearer term ways to manage particular concentration risk sold down some of our commitments or portfolio by offsetting portfolios of other types from other players, etcetera. So, you may see more of that kind of activity in the near-term, but overtime I think we remained convinced of what we have here is a strategically as a very high quality commercial real-estate origination capability both for term loans and for construction development loans and we want to not only maintain, but actually grow that capability overtime in a very good market, but it\u2019s going to require developing on those capabilities more robustly to \u2013 cannot keep all of that risk on our balance sheet under a stress testing environment so, is that kind of address your question?","John Pancari - Evercore","Yes, it did. If I can access one more quick thing around expenses, Harris, I know you mentioned that you\u2019re still struggling with the expenses here or remained challenges you put it and in terms of your efficiency ratio given your flattish expense expectations, it is fair to assume that the efficiency ratio was relatively stable here at this 74%, 75% level or can we see a come down a lit here in the next couple of quarters?","Harris Simmons","I mean some of the moving parts, the provision lending commitments, you have to take that out, I think that we fair about thinking about the ratio. Beyond that, we\u2019re working hard at some particular elements of non-interest income which we know we need to get to a little higher place we \u2013 our fee income mix looks like more like that of probably typical $15 billion bank or doesn\u2019t some of our larger peers. And some of those things take a little time to address, but we\u2019re working really hard on several aspects of that that we think over to the next few years will really help. The big driver is going to be just restoration of more traditional net interest margin levels as interest rates rise. That makes \u2013 that\u2019s going to make the big difference is getting back into a little more normal interest rate environment that will really change the number and we are continuing to work at cost control.","And I in the last couple of weeks have been in discussions about probably up to roughly 10 to 12 locations that I would expect that we will probably be closing in coming months or consolidating into other nearby branches etcetera. So, I mean, we are working on that front and doing what we can, but it\u2019s really a numerator, denominator problem rather on the revenue side more than it is, I think on the expense side in terms of what we can address. And we have got and we have some of these systems projects that are going to put some pressure on it for probably the next few quarters, especially until we can start to see some of the cost savings that come along with these projects.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Good afternoon. Doyle, I was wondering if you can give us an update on how you are thinking about those higher pieces of higher cost debt, we have got the one coming due this year and then a couple of pieces next year and so can you layout for us whether at this point you just intend to just let those mature and whether or not just normal maturity would cause you to have to also reissue to keep kind of flat on a funding cost basis?","Doyle Arnold","No. Our current expectation, Ken, is that we will pay-off that debt, the senior debt in September and the additional two tranches of sub-debt in the latter half of next year as they mature. And that the total amount of unsecured debt issued by the parent would come down over that time period, but probably we may issue small amounts of senior debt during that process, but the net amount of debt should come down. We are basically going to pay it off.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay.","Doyle Arnold","No more tenders are expected and we don\u2019t think though it would be very particularly productive.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, that makes sense. And then secondly, just from a balance sheet asset side efficiency perspective to your earlier points about the need for keeping excess liquidity and then the uncertainties about deposit outflows. Can you talk about where you stand in terms of just waiting for loan growth versus reinvesting in the securities portfolio in terms of waiting for those final rules and maintaining an adequate buffer on the liquidity side?","Doyle Arnold","I don\u2019t think we have changed our stance really from what we have been saying for a number of quarters now. There are no plans to buy significant amounts of longer dated securities, particularly mortgage-backed securities. I am not saying we won\u2019t do any, but the plan is to incrementally grow loans. And we think that the deposit \u2013 at the same time, deposit growth will \u2013 which has already slowed down and flattened will likely continue to do so. And we have anecdotally heard of and seen instances of customers beginning to draw deposits down to redeploy cash internally within their businesses. So, we are not planning to go out and invest a lot of that cash.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, right. So, you guys just getting up the sort of the governance of slowing the loan growth in pockets does not necessarily make you think about that any differently?","Doyle Arnold","No, because we still expect net loan growth. I think at this point we are probably going to allow one question each we want to get, but defer the follow-ups to James to handle after the call just so we can get \u2013 we got about five more people I think queued up. So, we will try to do bam bam bam.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Lightning around.","Doyle Arnold","Lightning around, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Doyle Arnold","Hi, Dave.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on the cash position, I was just wondering how much excess cash you think you have at this point over which you might need for the LCR and how long do you think it\u2019s going to take for loan growth to use up that excess assuming that your assumptions play out there?","David Hemingway","This is David Hemingway. First is there has been suggested we do not have final rules for the LCR. So, what I have to say is totally based upon our assumptions as to what the final rules might be, but we could have excess cash in the range I would think in the $2 billion to $3 billion range. And so you can actually do the math just how many quarters it would take to chew that up without any loan shrinkage. The big uncertainty is this if and when or when higher interest rates come is the $19 billion of non-interest bearing demand going to stay or are the depositors going to act rationally and pull some of that money out. And those are the issues that we deal with in asset and liability management and liquidity management, so\u2026.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","For how much of it converts into interest bearing?","David Hemingway","Well, how much of it converts into interest bearing and if we need the money we can probably keep it, but if we don\u2019t need the money, it will probably go.","Doyle Arnold","Yes. There is no circumstance under which I would see deposit funding as constraining loan growth, because you can always go out and buy it. Okay. We will move on to the next question.","Operator","Next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Hello, there. So, my question is on the deposit base, particularly the $19 billion of non-interest bearing, what is your latest thinking on how those deposits behave as rates increase, but the interest bearing and the non-interest bearing and then how do you think the mechanism of that tightening in bank\u2019s deposits behavior, whether it\u2019s raising reverse repo rate, raising interest of excess reserves doing something else?","Doyle Arnold","I would, Jeffrey, I\u2019d refer you to the investor presentations that we have given in the second quarter. There are a couple of them out there, one of which at least was filed as an 8-K where we lay out pretty explicitly our thinking and the assumptions that underlie our IRR modeling, but basically if you want to refer to somebody else\u2019s and tune with our thinking, I will refer you to the CFO of JPMorgan Chase, who laid out pretty explicitly what she thinks is going to happen, but I think kind of we are directionally in the same place she is, which is that the Fed will drain a lot of liquidity out of the system and that rates may rise. When rates rise, they may rise faster than people are expecting and a lot of this, I don\u2019t know, we have laid out some modeling assumptions about how much of our non-interest bearing DDA would have \u2013 would flow out and be replaced by interest bearing funds, but it\u2019s \u2013 and I think we are being more conservative on that front than a lot of peers and more explicit in publishing what we are modeling. So, I just refer you to that.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","And to the mechanism?","Doyle Arnold","As to the specific mechanisms the Fed might use and how much reliance on repos and other tools, I am not \u2013 that\u2019s for them to decide not for me to convince.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is open.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Hey, good afternoon guys.","Harris Simmons","Hello, Brian.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","I guess, you mentioned earlier about the small business lending award in Houston, but I think knowing you guys are one of the biggest small business lenders in the country and it sounds like there has been a lot of traction there, I guess not just for you guys within the second quarter, but it still feels like that\u2019s something that\u2019s carrying into the third quarter. I am kind of wondering why you are being a little bit more cautious for the loan growth outlook in the third versus a good second quarter and is this anything to do with the 504 run-off? And I guess second part of that question is can you update us on where the 504 national commercial real estate portfolio balances are quarter-over-quarter?","Doyle Arnold","No. It\u2019s not \u2013 the caution wasn\u2019t related to any expected change in the rate of 504 run-off, that\u2019s kind of its glide path that we have talked about. I guess it\u2019s probably more tempering just \u2013 some of it\u2019s tempered by the CRE limits that we are kind of enforcing for the time being until we get another read on stress testing at least and you have seen in the (EHA data), some pretty \u2013 three, three out of the last four weeks have been down for the industry for lending and we\u2019re despite the fact that pipelines remain pretty good and small business remains pretty good. We are hearing a little caution in overall and other aspects of the portfolio. James, you want to add any other commentary on that?","James Abbott","No, I was just filling the blank on the change. The portfolio of national real-estate loans is about a little over $3 billion, about $3.07 billion. It\u2019s divided between term commercial real-estate and owner occupied is about 60% owner occupied, 40% term commercial real-estate. The linked quarter decline on that portfolio was about $150 million. So, without that, our loan growth would have been a little bit obviously about $150 million stronger.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. And just \u2013 this is going to probably stabilize at $2 billion, is that what your guidance has been for the glide path?","Doyle Arnold","Current production levels, we\u2019ll put it about $1.5 billion, but we are starting to hear some green shoots. I would, it sounded this as I discussed it with the people in that group, it sounded like the green shoots of loan growth and credit quality back in 2009, you may have one or two blades of grass I think would be the description, but we are starting to hear some inquiries from community banks looking, they are starting to bump up against their liquidity ratio issues and are looking towards national real estate group as a source for that.","Brian Klock \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. Thanks for your time guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Given when you have gone through all the CCAR process and it\u2019s been back and forth and you have given a high level of compliance, have you ever considered rather than raising equity capital looking to spin off a bank that where you can get a higher valuation than where the stock is trading now. And that would also lower your asset size below $50 billion, so you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with CCAR on a go forward basis, have you considered something like that rather than raising equity?","Doyle Arnold","Let me I have been answering this question a number of times Harris and I as well. I mean spinning off a bank even if we were to contemplate it \u2013 it probably doesn\u2019t get you where you are suggesting we might want to try to be. If you got down to $40 billion to $45 billion then normal growth is going to take you back to the $50 billion mark which is cast in law currently. Within a fairly short period of time and the last thing we are going to do is blow up the capabilities that were built at great cost and great pain even assuming the Fed would say yes you have escaped, you are off the hook. I think even that point is debatable. I think you have giving \u2013 taking that path is highly, highly uncertain to achieve the outcome you are suggesting.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Okay. Thank you for taking my question.","James Abbott - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and External Communications","Okay. That\u2019s the end of the questions that we have in the end. We are over time at this point, anyway. We thank you for participating in the call today. And if you have follow-up questions please email me it\u2019s James Abbott and I will be happy to respond. And thank you for your time and see you very soon at a conference.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s program. This concludes the program.

You\u2019ve joined Zions Bancorporation's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott. You may begin.","James Abbott","Good evening and thank you, Latif. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2018 fourth quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives; after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook for the next four quarters. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer. ","Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full earning release as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. ","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout these. ","A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. During the question-and-answer section of this call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time now over to Harris Simmons. ","Harris Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you who\u2019ve joined us on the call today to discuss our 2018 fourth quarter results and results for full year 2018. The results for the quarter were strong relative to a year ago results.","Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights which we will address in some detail on subsequent slides. Slide 4 shows earnings per share on a GAAP basis, they've doubled from a year ago quarter. The year ago fourth quarter had a couple of items that reduced the results substantially which we called out on the slide. Additionally, we are of course subject to much lower corporate tax rate from the year ago period. Even adjusting for those factors, we are able to accomplish strong double-digit EPS growth. ","Turning to Slide 5, we delivered on our commitment to produce strong positive operating leverage for the year, with full year non-interest expense up only slightly compared to the prior year, while full year revenue increased 7%. As such, adjusted pre-provision net revenue increased to strong 14% and 13% if adjusted to exclude the charitable contribution of 2017 that we called out in previous earnings reports. For the quarterly results as shown on this slide, adjusted pre-tax pre-provision net revenue increased 18% over the same period a year ago and about 13% if adjusted to exclude the aforementioned charitable contribution. ","Perhaps, most notably, the 13% increase in PPNR produced an 18% increase on a per share basis, due primarily to $670 million worth of common stock repurchases completed during the year. We are very pleased with the 18% increase in per share of PPNR for the year. ","On Slide 6, you'll see the strong credit trends depicted on the chart on the right classified loans declining 38% from the year ago period and 11% from the prior quarter. Improvement in oil and gas loans was a major reason for the improvement. For the fourth quarter, we experienced net credit recoveries of $8 million on annualized 7 basis points of loans. We realized net loan recoveries of 4 basis points for the full year. ","Credit recoveries equaled $21 million for the quarter and $85 million for the year. Recoveries may remain a beneficial factor over the next few quarters, although we expect the oil and gas credit recovery cycle to subside. Non-performing assets plus loans 90 days past due declined 42% from the year ago period and equaled only 57 basis points. ","Our allowance for credit loss actually increased 1 basis point from the prior quarter. As noted in the release, the qualitative factors improved from the prior quarter, but due to a variety of broad macroeconomic and political factors, we increased the qualitative portion of the allowance. We are not seeing any substantive indicators of return in the credit cycle, although we're exercising caution in our lending activities generally, so that we will be well prepared for any downturn that might materialize. ","We currently expect a low overall rate of gross and net charge-offs in 2019, and relatively stable problem loan ratios assuming economic conditions similar to what we experienced in recent months. ","One broad industry topic that has been generating a lot of recent attention with investors is leveraged lending. One of the issues in discussing this, you have to focus on is the comparability of results across companies as there are varying definitions of such loans. ","Slide 7 shows the result of a survey done by Moody's that included 38 regional banks, including Zions. Moody's asked each bank to provide a dollar amount of loans where the subject company\u2019s total debt exceeded 4 times the company's earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation or EBITDA. At the time this survey was conducted, June 30th data was provided by the participants. It was measured as a percent of the Moody's definition of tangible common equity, which isn\u2019t quite the same as the way we present our tangible common equity. But regardless, the results were comparable to the other 37 banks. ","You can see that Zions\u2019 exposure is more than one-third less than the peer average and about one-fifth less than the peer media. This is in the line of business for us. Some of the loans in that bucket were not originated as leveraged, but are there today because of the recent session in the oil and gas industry, which reduced the cash flows for those borrowers. As cash flows for the energy industry improve, our exposure to loans with debt-to-EBITDA of more than 4 times to decline from current levels. ","In the recent years we have been talking frequently about the strategic importance of our long-term technology investments, all during a time when we've been keeping our expenses relatively flat. ","On Slide 8, you can see the key investments we are making in our core operating systems, customer-facing digital technologies and how they will improve the experience for our largest customer segments. ","To highlight a few I'd begin at the bottom of slide and note that our FutureCore programs replace our three loan systems and deposit system represents a generational investment and it is progressing very nicely. ","By the first half of this year, all of our loans will have been converted to our new modern platform.","Moving to the top half of the slide, let me highlight a number of significant new customer-facing digital technologies that are in various stages of rollout. Treasury Internet Banking or TIB 2.0 as we call it is the primary online communication tool that 8,000 of our largest commercial customers utilize. We believe we are top in the industry in providing treasury management products for our clients and this upgrade even further enhances our digital capabilities that touch customers with approximately $10 billion of our $24 billion in non-interest-bearing deposits.","Next, the rollout for our digital business and mortgage loan application software will represent a significant improvement in the customer experience and how we process these types of loans on an end-to-end basis. In the case of mortgage the digital application will give us the ability to pull down our customers\u2019 income tax forms along with bank statements. These are two of the biggest customer pain points today.","Finally, in early 2020 we will replace our online mobile banking systems which touch over 600,000 retail customers and 125,000 small business customers. This system is a workhost for us and we believe our new offering will position us well relative to our major competitors and close number of gaps that exist today. Each of these technology investments are foundational and focused directly on our most important customer segments and the benefit should be long-lasting.","Slide 9 is a list of our key objectives for 2019 and 2020 and our commitment to shareholders. We believe we can continue to deliver strong positive operating leverage as we deploy technology and continue to implement many of the thousands of ideas we have collected from employees on how to better operate in a simple easy and fast manner. We expect that such positive operating leverage will allow the pre-provision net revenue to grow at a rate of high single-digits without the help from additional rate hikes. ","We are firmly committed to demonstrating superior credit quality relative to our peers which has been the Bank's primary source of earnings volatility in the past.","Regarding returning capital to shareholders we have increased the payout ratio which we just find as payouts to common shareholders as a percentage of earnings applicable to common shareholders from approximately 20% of earnings a few short years ago to more than 140% in the fourth quarter of 2018. We view an increase in balance sheet leverage as appropriate, particularly given the reduction of the risk profile of the company. ","Since 2009, which is probably the year of peak stress for most banks and certainly for Zions, the total assets of the company increased 34%, while the risk-weighted assets increased only 4%. Our changing asset mix was the primary contributor. We replaced CDOs with government agency mortgage-backed securities. We have replaced land development loans with municipal loans and residential mortgages. ","Outside of asset concentrations we have rooted out risk in many different areas within operational risk. This reduction of risk allows us to reduce our capital from the current level. The decision on the magnitude, timing and form of capital return is a Board level decision and we will update you as appropriate.","With that overview, I'm going to turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in a little bit additional detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss ","Thank you, Harris, and good evening everyone. As Harris said, this is a good quarter in our opinion and a solid year on many fronts. I'll begin on Slide 10. This highlights two key profitability metrics: return on assets and return on tangible common equity. We are encouraged to report the return on assets at about 1.2% even after adjusting for infrequent items and the return on tangible common equity to again exceed 14%. ","We expect positive operating leverage to combine with solid credit performance and continued strong capital returns to result in further expansion of balance sheet returns.","On Slide 11, for the fourth quarter of 2018, Zions\u2019 net interest income continued to demonstrate solid growth relative to the prior period of $50 million to $576 million or 10%. In some of the prior quarters, we have called out interest recoveries that were greater than $1 million per loan, but we did not have any such recoveries in either the year ago quarter or the fourth quarter of 2018. ","With respect to the revenue components, I'll start with the balance sheet volume and move to rate in just a moment. ","Slide 12 shows our average loan growth of 4.2% relative to the year ago period. Although not listed on the slide, the period end growth in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter was an annualized 8%. Average deposits increased 3.6% from the year ago period and increased an annualized 5% from the prior quarter. ","Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased 1% from the year ago period and 5% from the prior year annualized -- prior quarter annualized. Thus far we've been able to achieve this growth of deposit balances with a relatively modest increase in deposit cost. Our cumulative increase in the cost of total deposits since the third quarter of 2015, which was immediately preceding the first rate hike by the Federal Reserve has been only 25 basis points or total deposit re-pricing beta of about 12% over that period. ","This speaks to the quality of our deposit franchise. We have a favorable mix of relationship-based operational deposits as we look at the stratification of deposits by size, for example, deposit customers with less than $5,000 with us or our customers with more than $50 million with us, we see very low cumulative deposit betas in this rising rate environment for customers with balances of less than $5 million. And that represents about three quarters of our total deposit base. ","Examining loan growth a bit closer, Slide 13 depicts year-over-year period end balance growth by portfolio type with the size of the circles representing the relative size of the portfolios. For most categories, we experienced solid and consistent growth. There are three areas we've experienced slight attrition. In the commercial real estate space, loan growth was adversely impacted by slight attrition in the term CRE and national real estate portfolios of about $235 million over the prior year. We've also continued to experience attrition of some of our larger loans, some of which was intentional to reduce loans that were not meeting our profitability requirements and reallocate capital elsewhere, and some of which has been due to the incremental competitive pressure on larger commercial loans, which appears to be coming from debt funds, debt capital markets and covenant light structures and asset-based lending perhaps from other banks. Pressures that we noted in the last quarter have continued. ","We experienced relatively consistent growth trends in our 1-4 family and home equity loan which have been growing in the mid to high single-digits for quite some time and we are pleased with the continued growth of owner-occupied loans which have been growing in the mid to high single-digits year-over-year for the past six quarters. ","As a reminder, owner-occupied commercial loans are generally small business loans underwritten based upon the cash flows of the borrower and include real estate in the collateral package. Oil and gas loans have increased 16% over the prior year, primarily from a relatively strong increase in exploration and production loans. Importantly, our oilfield services loans are now less than 1% of total loans, and are down about $500 million from the 2014 year end figure. ","Municipal loan growth has also continued to be strong during the past year. As noted on previous calls we've hired staff to help us grow in this area, which is focused on smaller municipalities and the central services of those cities. ","We've maintained strong credit quality standards and feel very good about the risk and return profile of this portfolio. We are optimistic in the near term about the growth of loans based upon the relatively strong economic backdrop, improvement in small business and owner-occupied loan growth and a review of lender assessment. But as noted earlier, there are competitive forces generally outside of the banking industry that caused us to keep our outlook at slightly to moderately increasing. Our organization is aligned in our view of the trade-off between loan growth and incremental risk. We would rather maintain our underwriting standards and accept less loan growth and we believe investors will be rewarded in the longer term for this discipline. ","Slide 14 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. Top-line is loan yields, which increased to 4.79%, up 8 basis points from the prior quarter. Recall in the prior quarter, about 2 basis points of loan yields were related to the previously mentioned interest recoveries. We are looking at our loan beta, or a change in loan yield relative to change in the federal funds rate and we calculate a re-pricing beta of about 50%, which is consistent with a portfolio that has about half of its loan indexed to either PRIME or short-term LIBOR. And we show this in the appendix on Slide 24. ","Relative to the prior quarter the yield on securities increased 18 basis points to 2.46%. About 8 basis points of the linked-quarter increase is attributable to reduce premium amortization relative to the prior quarter. The remainder is primarily due to older securities with lower yields running off and using that cash flow to buy new securities at higher yields. The shorter duration of the portfolio is helpful. Recall, we built a portfolio that has almost no net convexity in our models and therefore we believe duration extension risk is limited. ","Cash flows, therefore, remain generally stable as rates rise, allowing us to reinvest cash flows at the new money yield of about 3.25% in the current environment, which compares favorably to the 2.5% yield of the overall portfolio. As a reminder, premium amortization is highly dependent upon prepayment and therefore difficult to accurately forecast but assuming stability there the yield on the securities portfolio should move higher at a moderate pace over the near term, all other things equal. ","The cost of total deposits and borrowed funds increased 9 basis points in the quarter to 0.54%, resulting in a funding beta of about 30% for the year-over-year and linked-quarter figures. ","As a reminder, in this case, beta refers to the change in the deposit costs and borrowings relative to the change in the cost of the target -- I\u2019m sorry change in the target Fed funds rate. These elements combine to result in a net interest margin of 3.67% for the quarter, which increased 4 basis points from the prior quarter and 22 basis points from the year ago period. The net interest margin beta or the rate of change in the net interest margin relative to changes in the Fed funds target rate was 22% over the prior year. ","One of the most substantial drivers of this margin expansion is the increasing value of our non-interest bearing deposits in the higher rate environment. Because of the nature of most of our deposits being operating accounts for businesses and households, we expect our non-interest-bearing deposits base to remain a competitive advantage. ","As we have noted in prior public appearances, if the economy remains strong and industry wide loan growth accelerates, perhaps then we might expect the deposit competition to intensify somewhat. If that becomes the case, our net interest margin beta may be somewhat less sensitive to rate increases when compared to prior periods. ","Additionally, we\u2019ve begun to discuss a moderation of our asset sensitive position as the rising rate cycle maybe decelerating, as of other balance sheet composition changes, such as capital distributions and moving cash into securities, we are unlikely to move quickly and aggressively, but rather make any such changes at a measured pace. ","Finally, we expect that if the Federal Reserve remains on-hold with interest rates, the net interest margin should be relatively stable over the near-term, driven by factors already highlighted in my comments. ","Next, a brief review of non-interest income on Slide 15. Customer-related fees increased 1% over the prior year to $128 million. The primary sources of income that changed are listed on this page. ","For the full year customer-related fee income increased by more than 3% to $501 million. We continued to work hard to accelerate fee income growth, although fees from treasury management are influenced to a degree by deposits and by market rates for earnings credits applied to those balances, which in the rising rate environment can create a slight headwind in our fee income trend. ","Similarly the fee income realized from mortgage banking activity tends to be countercyclical, slowing and possibly decreasing when the economy is strengthening due to the effect of higher interest rate on refinancing activity.","Non-interest expense on Slide 16 increased to $419 million from $417 million in the year ago quarter. However, adjusted non-interest expense, which adjusts for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other similar items was also very stable at $418 million versus $415 million in the year ago period. ","If we make one further adjustment to the year ago period that is the larger than usual charitable contribution of $12 million, the core adjusted non-interest expense increased about 3.7%, which is moderately higher than the outlook we provided to investors a year-ago of low single-digit. But I would note that credit quality performance and revenue growth was stronger than originally modeled, and most of that outperformance has been passed or is being passed on to our shareholders. ","As discussed in various public appearances during the quarter, we expect to indeed experience a significant reduction in FDIC insurance costs from the prior quarter and the year ago period. Recall that in the prior quarter, we had a nearly $4 million FDIC insurance expense cumulative adjustment, which was related to the consolidation of our bank charters. And since 2016, we were subject to the large banks surcharge that was designed to drive the deposit insurance fund to our reserve ratio of 1.35%. The large bank FDIC surcharge was eliminated in the fourth quarter because of the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio objective was met and this served to reduce our FDIC insurance expense as compared to the prior quarter by about $6 million.","Turning to Slide 17, the efficiency ratio was 57.8% compared to the year ago period of 61.6%. The efficiency ratio calculations has some seasonality to them and that there are more days of interest income in the second half of the year when compared to the first and of course the seasonal expense increase in the first quarter of each year related to payroll tax and stock-based compensation among other items. We reiterate our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio of below 60% for the full year of 2019 excluding the possible benefits of rate increases.","Finally on Slide 18, now this depicts our financial outlook for the next 12 months relative to the fourth quarter of 2018. There is no significant change to our outlook from that which was reported throughout the fourth quarter of 2018 as you can see on this slide.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dave Rochester","I was just wondering, sorry if I missed this, but if you're thinking about an up 3 basis point to 4 basis point NIM, given hikes as your base case going forward, and especially given in the December hike we just had? And then on your NII guide, we are just wondering if you're assuming that the current flat interest rate curve persists and if we don't get any additional rate hikes just curious what your base case for deposit costs assuming that stable NIM guide that you just gave for that scenario?","Harris Simmons","Dave, I\u2019ll start and ask my partners here to weigh in. With respect to the -- I think kind of what you referred to as a NIM beta, any NIM expansion related to the change underlying rates, that's approximately right. I did say in my prepared remarks that we are expecting a few basis points I think I quoted that 22% sort of NIM beta related to the change in underlying that\u2019s on target. That has been our experience in the last couple of quarters, impossible to predict it with a lot of precision as you know. But if kind of loan pricing and composition and deposit pricing and composition behaves, we would expect something that looks kind of like that.","The second part of your question was related to deposit costs. Our base case is that we would expect deposit cost to drift marginally upward over the course of the next several quarters. It\u2019s sort of reflecting and catch-up on the change in rates. But as I said, we believe we have a very strong deposit rate base as it is very relationship-driven, and largely operational in nature. And so the composition of our deposit base we would not expect to change a lot. And likewise, we expect rate on deposits to remain well behaved.","Dave Rochester","And just one, switching to loans real quick, just a small one. In your table, the heat map in the back, I mean it was like it was the great loan growth quarter but the drivers were varied a little bit in terms of your markets. So I was just curious what was the driver, the one-off in C&I and energy and the strength in California, looked like California was really strong for you guys, maybe you can just give an overarching comment on that too, would be great?","Scott McLean","Sure, Dave. This is Scott McLean and for the quarter, the linked-quarter the bottom half of that slide pointing to energy did have a soft quarter. It really is related to the softness that the top half of that page indicates. They had a book of about $150 million book of lower profit business that they were allowing to run down. They've also -- there was one client that we actually moved from C&I to energy largely because that customer's revenues related to energy had actually increased. And so these were kind moves we make as we watch our commercial clients. So, but other than that -- and they're seeing all the same pressure on the high-end of the market that you hear from other banks and that we've reported before.","But I would note the top half of the page and it really is just worn out in that bottom half too that if you look at the top half year-over-year it really is good balanced growth between C&I owner-occupied you can see kind of 600 million there. The muni lending of 400 million the home-related lending of over almost 700 million, just gives solid balance. And so, we continue to be pleased with that. ","The other thing that\u2019s didn't show up quite as much this quarter as it did in the third quarter and the second quarter that our four smaller affiliates Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Washington they make up about 25% of the company and they have actually been really producing solid loan growth, probably 35% to 40% of the loan growth of the company up until this quarter when the larger banks kicked in, more in line with what the larger banks have done historically.","Dave Rochester","Anything, any specific drivers of the C&I growth in California just for this quarter in that bottom chart?","Harris Simmons","There were a couple of larger deals, but nothing, nothing that really stands out, so. I think it also was helped by slower paydowns, so that was the help.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Just had a question, on Slide 18 the loan growth, or loan balance commentary that you have, it looks like you explicitly called out competition from non-bank lenders, I know you addressed a little bit in your comments, but this is the first time you've actually written that in your outlook. Has the competition from the non-banks gotten worse or how is that changing? Thanks.","James Abbott","This is James, Ken, sort of I would describe it as is, this is fairly consistent with what we saw at least what the lenders report to us that they were seeing in the prior quarter and so we're just reiterating the concept here. We -- I'm aware that some other banks have mentioned that in the month of December it wasn't as intense for them. Our folks have reported that it's been fairly similar throughout the quarter. So perhaps some difference between geographies I suppose or us versus some other banks I suppose. But it's a consistent pressure.","Ken Zerbe","And then just maybe a question for Harris. And in terms of capital return I know you said it is a Board decision in terms when you announce that. I guess first of all when does the Board meet and when we might hear some outcome of that capital return but also just given where your stock is, given how much the whole market sold off over the last several months, has your thinking about capital return changed? Like could you be more aggressive or would you ask for more aggressive capital -- share buybacks given what\u2019s happened with your stock price? ","Harris Simmons","Well, first, they meet a week on Friday. So put that on your calendar. ","Ken Zerbe","We will do.","Harris Simmons","I think we may look to be incrementally more aggressive, obviously again conversation we\u2019ll have with the Board and as far as for regulators that's something we take seriously as well. But we think there's some room to do still a fair amount of capital distribution and we\u2019re certainly talking sort of where the market is today relative to where it\u2019s been. So we will take that into account for sure. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Your line is now open. ","Jennifer Demba","Just curious about the process improvements that Zions has made in the last several quarters and wondering where we are kind of in the innings of that process. How many more internal processes do you think there are that can be improved and if you could give us examples of what we\u2019re looking at? ","Scott McLean","Sure. Jennifer, this is Scott McLean. I would say we probably all have a different take on this but I would say we\u2019re in the early innings, probably somewhere in the third inning. We\u2019ve been at this for three years and there is just a significant number of small to medium sized opportunities that is providing a really nice source of expense reduction. It is not any one big initiative but it's a collection of smaller ones that are allowing us to reduce expense $0.5 million, $1 million at a whack and sometimes more than that. And the way I would characterize them is they are largely related to adopting common practices and where we may have had six different practices in a certain area, in terms of process or technology, we\u2019re adopting one practice across the company. All our affiliates have agreed to that. They feel just fine about it. So adopting common practices, another place -- another area or theme would be around automation and numerous examples of just taking sample activities and automating them where it can take two, three days out of a process. I\u2019d be happy to give you examples but we\u2019ll do offline for over an hour. Those would be probably the two most important common themes. And then the third one, which is on our technology initiatives like the ones that Harris highlighted, we\u2019re not we are not customizing our new technologies and that is -- will create savings ultimately longer-term. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","First question just on the tech spend that you have -- or the tech initiatives page that you showed earlier in the deck. It looks like a lot of these things are finally getting to a point were \u201819 we should start to get that full implementation. I was wondering if you can update us on how much that double spend was costing still in '18 and at what point do we start to see that turn into net savings? I know that's been a long tailed discussion, but it seems like with the slide that we should be getting closer to that I wonder if you can help us understand the trajectory?","Harris Simmons","I guess I mean the first thing I would say is I just wouldn't look for tech spending to decrease some. We have spending a lot on this core system replacement. We\u2019re about halfway through the total exercise. I mean we will half the balance sheet there, we expect by the end February actually. We would be making decisions about that sure in the next couple of weeks. To go live with the second of three releases of this core systems platform over presence a week. And once we do that we will have all the loans on -- we then have the deposit fees to proceed to -- and that's the most complicated of them and probably represents about half of the total effort. But the spending I mean some of this has been capitalized as we've gone, some of that capitalized spending is now being amortized because the consumer loan portion has now been in service for the last year. ","We will have the commercial loan piece in service I would expect by the end of this quarter and so we will start amortizing that and then we have to spend on the deposit system. And roughly half of that gets expensed and about half of it roughly gets capitalized. But it's -- the need to continue to spend on technology is -- I just don\u2019t see an end to it. And every time I thought that maybe I would then there's some the next new thing. And so I do think that in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s one of the things that is producing the ability to keep operating costs reasonably flat. But the total strength in technology has continued to increase even as the spend in other areas has been diminished. And I think if that run for ways longer. So that's one of the things that gives us a fair amount of optimism that we will be able to continue to see some reasonable operating leverage if the economy holds up on short of a recession. I think that's going to work pretty well, but it won't be for a lack of technology spend. ","Scott McLean","This is Scott, I would just add to that. Many of the systems we're replacing or enhancing are fully depreciated and the expense part in current year P&L cost is really quite nominal. And so generally on almost all of these technology investments you are increasing your cost initially. You may able to have a savings elsewhere such as an FTE but just a pure technology, built-in expense goes up for three to five year period depending on how long you are amortizing it. The other thing I would say is that as we look at our total technology and spend on a P&L basis, probably 60%, 70% of it is offensive, it's not just keep the lights on. That number was just the opposite probably five, six years ago. And so the good news about the spend is that it's building out all the systems that Harris described, many of the systems Harris described and it is largely an offensive investment.","Ken Usdin","Understood Scott. And if I can just follow up on a point that Harris made. So Harris your point about looking forward, I'm looking at the 2019 and 2020 objectives. And to your point about presuming the economy holds up and a lot of things go with the continued way they've gone that target of trying to get to a high single-digit pre-pre net revenue growth. Do you think you can maintain that magnitude given the point you made about the hope for continued decent positive operating leverage?","Harris Simmons","Yes, I think over the next year or two that would be our objective and at some point that pump down catches up with it. But I think if you look at -- its instructive to look at where we've brought the efficiency ratio over the last three years from up in the 73%, 74% down to a number that's now really competitive with little -- pretty compatible with the peer group. And I guess the point is we don\u2019t think we're finished yet, and that will help to drive operating leverage for the next year or two.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan. Your question please.","Steven Alexopoulos","I guess to start to follow up on the conversation of the need to reinvest in technology. When we look at the low single-digit expense guidance for 2019, what's the most realistic range that we should be thinking about for 2019?","Harris Simmons","We are deliberately -- we are using that language deliberately, because we are trying not to be overly prescriptive around that, because we need some flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as they may come up. But our definition of low single digits I think is consistent with what it has been in the past.","Steven Alexopoulos","I mean this year 2018 if we adjust out the charitable contribution, I think while you said you were 3.7%...","Harris Simmons","Yes [Multiple Speakers]\u2026","Steven Alexopoulos","Will you be at that range again in 2019?","Harris Simmons","What I said was that was a little bit over our targeted range of low single-digits to put some guardrail around that.","Steven Alexopoulos","I guess I'm trying to understand given is a lot of talk on reinvestment in technology if we should be bracing for another 3% or so year on expense growth or\u2026","Paul Burdiss","But it's really important to note though that, I mean we have also got as Scott said, a lot of opportunity to continue to simplify the organization. We are working really hard, as Harris said, to take the savings that we are creating out of operational efficiencies and invested in technology to ensure that not only are we providing table stakes for our customers, but really starting to be a little more offensive with respect to the products and services that we can offer.","Harris Simmons","And I would tell you, I mean part of our plans this coming year is to invest more in people to build stronger pipeline of bankers for the future in training, et cetera, we just think that's critical. And we'd probably be spending more there even that we're finding ways to fund that. I mean I think we're quite optimistic that we can do that while still keeping total non-interest expense in this low single digit range. And I define low single-digit as being where the guardrails on that are, in my mind we're going to spend in part on what revenue growth is looking like too. One of the things that added to this 3.7% growth is just incentive compensation, because if you look at PPNR, forget about the effects of tax reform. I mean PPNR was up about 13% on a real apples-to-apples basis and incentive compensation is going to rise as that happens and that's one of the things, one of the real drivers this year of that 3.7%.","Scott McLean","And credit profile has been really strong, as I noted in my comments\u2026","Steven Alexopoulos","Just separately if we look at non-interest bearing deposits, your balances have been far more resilient than just about every peer out there. Are you guys expecting to see a migration out of non-interest bearing this year, or do you think those balances going to hold in there? Thanks?","Scott McLean","Well, I will say that our models would indicate and as we described in the past and we described our interest sensitivity, our models assume some level of migration out of non-interest bearing deposits and into other interest bearing deposits. You said our deposits have been very resilient, and probably I would say more resilient than our models would have indicated. And when we really peel that back and do the analysis behind it, we think the key driver is the relationship nature of the deposits and the proportion of operating deposits that we have. I mean, we had a very granular level by customer we can discern what average balance is, highs and lows and really measure that against operating needs. And the fact is that we've got a very high proportion of those demand deposits, our operating deposits because of the relationship nature, because of the operating nature of the deposits, they are just proving to be a little more sticky than even we had expected.","Harris Simmons","It's also related to our loan growth. I mean where you see our loans growing is in C&I, owner occupied, municipal, home equity and one to four family, those are all really deposit rich customers. If our growth was really heavy in CRE, you just wouldn't see the same balance, DDA balance growth. But one of the nice things is that our DDA balances on average are really growing pretty consistently across the company depending on what time periods you look at. And there's certainly been more pressure in Texas, which you would expect it's just the larger client market and there's been certainly pressure in Utah related to the credit unions but really good solid growth in DDA non-interest bearing across the company.","Scott McLean","I'm going to make one more comment just because I'm so excited about the value of our deposit base and I talk about it a lot over the years. Another really important point is that as I said in my prepared remarks, so we look at a stratification of our deposits by deposit size and it's by customer size, deposit size. We see a real difference in behavior in terms of resiliency of the volumes with respect to their required deposit repricing betas, a real difference based on the stratification and the size of the depositors. And so what we\u2019re observing is our very largest depositors of which on a relative basis we probably have fewer are much more sensitive to raise and therefore deposit migration is more prevalent there. As I said in my prepared remarks, 75% of our depositors approximately are under $5 million and that's where we\u2019re seeing a lot of stickiness.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. ","Gary Tenner","Just a couple of quick questions, first and I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. Did you mentioned along the way what your yields where on new loan production for the fourth quarter?","James Abbott","We haven\u2019t mentioned it. But it's probably near 5.25, 5.20 GAAP yield something thereabouts.","Gary Tenner ","And then Paul as you were going through your remarks, you mentioned or you highlighted the FDIC insurance. Is the $6 million a good run rate or did that -- was there any adjustment this quarter that reduced that below what the forward run rate would look like?","Paul Burdiss","What I tried to say there was approximately $5 million to $6 million reduction in FDIC insurance specifically related to the elimination of the deposit insurance fund surcharge, and so I would expect that to continue.","James Abbott","And said differently Gary, I think that the number that you\u2019re seeing in the income statement there this quarter is a pretty good run rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Long of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","David Long","Going back to expenses here really quick, if your financial outlook on the revenue side does not materialize here in 2019 at the point where revenue is possibly down. Do you have levers to pull on the expense side to still put up positive operating leverage for the year?","Paul Burdiss","Well, historically we had and Harris or Scott please jump in. Historically, where we revenues and expenses were not aligned, we have absolutely been able to adjust our expenses. The biggest lever we have there is incentive compensation, which is a lever that we have absolutely used over the course of the last couple of years.","David Long","And then separately, we\u2019re starting to see banks do some deposit pricing strategies in different regions. Are there any regions where your deposit base may not be as strong or regions where you think there are opportunities to gain share by doing some incentive pricing?","Harris Simmons","Well, we price locally so each of the affiliate banks manage their deposit pricing and we obviously give them internal credit and they weigh the opportunity versus what they can earn internally. Probably the largest opportunity frankly is with Internet money market accounts and things that we can do on the margin, including just broker deposits. But there are limits to how much of that we would want to do. I mean I think fundamentally we want to make sure that we are protecting the deposit base that we have, making sure that we are -- that it's continuing to grow and growing for the right reasons. And on the edges of that there are some things we could do. But I don\u2019t see us doing campaigns and any of the markets where we have branches.","Scott McLean","And I will add if I could that rate is not the primary value preposition that we're offering to our customers, it's really about advice and skill. And so we're able or tend to attract higher money has provided funding but not liquidity as you know, and so this is something that we think about very carefully.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Spahr","The comments on the repurchase authorization and the board meets a week from Friday. When you say more aggressive more of the same or perhaps more than the $250 million that we saw in the fourth quarter?","Scott McLean","I'd say that you have to stay tuned. I guess more of the same or only be more aggressive relative to doing less I guess. So I think I'd really want to wait until late the board has something to say, I don\u2019t want to front run them too much here.","Christopher Spahr","And then going back to Scott's, talking about some of the offensive benefits of the initiatives that you're doing on the slide or whatever the slide is -- Slide 8. Can you give us some examples of what those offensive measures are? I think most of the examples that you gave are more on the expense side. And what I'm getting at is that the growth still is lagging some of your larger peers. And I'm just wondering like what areas we can expect or might see a pick-up in growth?","Scott McLean","So if you look at Slide 8 really the top five horizontal panels are all offensive, and I'll shift to the digital -- this loan application and the digital mortgage loan application. Again, this is a online way for a client to start a loan application in the case of a digital business loan application, started at home work on it in the branch where the banker completed in their office, send it in. We've automated a way to take the data and pull it into our loan originations system and then make a decision very quickly. All of this happens by paper today and there is not an electronic version of it. The digital mortgage loan application, again as Harris noted, to be able to take -- to be able to pull down a customer's tax forms and their bank statements with other banks, it is a game changer for us.","And we're not going to change the dynamics of the residential mortgage lending business, but we don't have to. We originated about $2.5 billion this year that we'd like to think of that as $4 billion to $5 billion origination business for us. And this product particularly allows us to originate conventional mortgages, which has not been a large part of what we have done historically. So it allows us to create a much more viable mortgage product in our branches, we are very excited about it. So those two particularly are always are rich with offensive client building opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Could you -- in response to the securities portfolio, it seems like it repriced quite a bit this quarter and you said it from premium amortization. Was there any shift in the duration of the portfolio and your expected turnover in that portfolio?","Harris Simmons","No, it was really -- a lot of it was related to as I noted in my prepared comments a change in the premium amortization, change in prepayments. The products that we are investing in have remained relatively consistent, duration of the portfolio is consistent, extension risk is limited in our models as I noted. And importantly -- so for example, we don't have any 30 year MBS in the portfolio. So all of those philosophical, I think around the portfolio haven\u2019t changed.","Kevin Barker","And then in regard to the follow up some of your comments around oil, loan pick up when you say a little bit of pick up this quarter compared to what you said in previous quarters, we saw some of your competitors also cite a pickup in oil lending as well. Is it primarily due to increasing demand or a slowdown in the runoff that you've seen there?","Scott McLean","So the growth that we've seen year-over-year in energy about to -- really the majority of it is upstream reserve base lending and midstream, both of which we have very low loss count, Kevin. Our energy services portfolio saw slight uptick, but it wasn\u2019t anything to really speak of. And as you know, our energy services portfolio now represents about low 20s, 22% 23% of our total portfolio going into the downturn, at the end of 2014 it was about 40%.","James Abbott","And Scott, if I can just clarify that\u2019s total oil and gas loans not total loans, the 20% of total oil and gas loans.","Scott McLean","That\u2019s right, yes. Thank you, James. So we have changed the mix of the portfolio. The portfolio is also sits today an outstanding of about 2.3 billion, down from 3.1 billion at the end of 2014. So we have contracted by about a third and repositioned the portfolio also. And the growth again we are seeing is primarily reserve based and midstream again, which are really solid markets for us.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?","James Abbott ","Thank you, Latif. And we thank all of you for joining the call today. If you have follow-up questions, please contact me at james.abbott@zionsbancorp.com and I'll be available throughout the evening to return your request.

This webcast is being recorded.","I will now turn the time over to James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations.","James Abbott","Thank you, Sabrina [ph], and good evening everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2015 earnings.","Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.","A fully copy of the earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at ZionsBancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer session. During that sessions we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you as we discuss our third quarter results.","On Slide 3 of the text presentation are some key points, and several of these are highlights or initiatives that are working well and within expectations. There are a couple of areas that still need some improvement, and I'll touch on a few of these in my remarks. But as an overarching comment, I would say that I'm very encouraged with both the pace of the improvements and the very substantial nature of the projects on which we are working, all of which are designed to help produce return on equity that is considerably strong than our recent -- stronger than our recent results, as well as to maintain strong asset quality and to enable the Company to be more nimble at adapting to a rapidly changing banking environment which in turn we expect will drive solid and sound growth.","So the first thing I'd mention on Slide 3 is the charter consolidation efforts are working well. As I mentioned in the press release, we've received regulatory approval to consolidate our seven subsidiary banks under a single national bank charter, and we expect to complete that on December 31st this year.","And in addition to regulatory approval, many of the tasks that need to be accomplished are tracking well, and I'm pleased with the work of a lot of groups within the Company that are working hard to make this happen on schedule. We will continue to emphasize our locally oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brands in each market we serve. We really believe that's the strength of the Company. We're simultaneously streamlining our risk and credit organizations and enhancing the local credit decision-making authority that we have out in the field.","On Slide 4, we're introducing a new scorecard graph with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by 2017. The bar on the right illustrating the projected progress to be achieved by yearend.","We are on track to achieve half of the targeted cost reductions by yearend. And I would note that our subsidiary banks are already exceeding 50% of their total aggregate goal.","We are encouraged with the achievement of non-interest expenses at or below the $400 million level. For the quarter, our commitment is to hold that line item adjusted for certain restructuring costs to below $1.6 billion for the year. We are spending considerable time preparing the Company to continue to realize the remainder of the gross cost savings and to keep non-interest expense below $1.6 billion in 2016 as well.","I would direct you to Slide 5. Another key measure of our commitment to shareholders is to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below for the second half of 2015. And we're encouraged with the achievement of an efficiency ratio of just under 70% in the third quarter. We are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio of 66% or better in 2016, as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1st of this year.","On Slide 6, we highlight the progress that we've made and expect to make with regard to our systems upgrade. I'd invite you to read this in its entirety, but the high-level summary is that we are broadly tracking in line with our schedule, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for our future investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where digital capabilities and technologies generally are going to play an increasingly important role. There is simply a very substantial amount of work that is taking place to keep all of this on schedule and on budget.","On Slide 7 we display some information with respect to our loans and deposits. The loan growth rate is below our targeted objective. We're working to improve in that area. Some of that is due to the attrition of energy loans, which have historically been a meaningful contributor to growth. However, during the past year, that portfolio has obviously declined substantially due to the decline in commodity prices and the resulting decline in borrowing basis and general activity in that sector.","I mentioned earlier that our risk management practices are curbing our appetite for the incremental higher-risk deal, and we expect that the benefit of this decision will manifest itself with tempered credit quality metrics and credit costs during any period of future stress, and ultimately in the form of a lower cost of capital as a result.","Deposit growth, shown in the chart on the right, has been a strong story for Zions for many years, and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most valuable source, non-interest bearing deposits. Although the ratio of non-interest bearing deposits to total deposits may certainly be expected to decline somewhat in a rising rate environment, the intrinsic value of those deposits should increase at an even faster rate and thus provide a lift in the economic value of equity and a very substantial increase in earnings, as that happens.","With that brief overview, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul to review the financial results. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good evening everyone. I'll begin on Slide 8.","For the third quarter of 2015, Zions reported earnings of $84 million or $0.71 per share. Although there was some noise that was detailed in the press release, which I'll point out in the call, the noise largely cancels out and we believe that the third quarter reflects a good platform for growth.","Relative to the prior quarter, after adjusting for the one-time loss related to the sale of collateralized debt obligation securities, earnings per share were unchanged from $0.41 per share. Relative to the second quarter, net interest income was largely stable. Fee income, after adjusting for items such as securities and asset sale gains, was also generally stable. Non-interest expense declined to less than $400 million and the year-to-date result is tracking to below the $1.6 billion target even before adjusting for items such as severance.","Looking at the provision for loan and lease losses, we had expected a moderate build in the reserve for energy loans, partially offset by continued reserve release in the rest of the portfolio. The elevated provision of the third quarter was affected by elevated net charge-offs. Although we do not expect the forward one-year net charge-offs for energy loans to remain at the elevated third quarter level throughout the period, we do expect some further charge-offs as the energy industry's financial condition continues to develop, and those charge-offs are likely to be somewhat lumpy due to the larger average size of those loans.","Details of our investment portfolio are shown on Slide 9. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the last year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in light of the new liquidity coverage ratio rules, and more broadly, in order to manage balance sheet liquidity more effectively. Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments.","Well, when we began this program, we indicated that we were targeting a portfolio of mortgage-backed securities of about $6 billion to be accumulated over a period of two to three years. During the third quarter we accelerated the purchases somewhat as we added a net $670 million on average to our available-for-sale investment portfolio when compared to the second quarter. In light of a general market expectation for rising short-term interest rates, we are exercising caution in how much potential revenue due to asset sensitivity we forgo as we purchase fixed-rate investments and how much duration extension risk we take in the investment portfolio.","The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over three years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is about 2.6 years to date, and if rates were to rise by 200 basis points across the curve, our model indicates that the duration of the entire portfolio would only modestly increase to 2.7 years. Importantly, the addition of these fixed-rate investments did not adversely impact the asset sensitivity of the Company, as shown in the table at the bottom-right of that slide.","Turning to loan growth on Slide 10. Net commercial and industrial loan growth is about 4%, excluding the effect of energy loan attrition which we have accomplished without an adverse change in underwriting standards. Meanwhile, construction land development loans have increased about 17%. Most of this growth is attributable to increased line utilization on commitments. We manage loan concentrations based upon commitment levels relative to capital, both base [ph] and adverse, and as a result, we have limited commitment growth on CMD loans. We are continually reviewing concentration levels as well as portfolio statistics such as loan-to-value levels and we feel comfortable with the quality of the growth we have experienced.","Residential mortgage continues to be a focus, although production in this category is significantly impacted by the shape of the yield curve. The two portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more are the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio.","The national real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans, and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point in the overall growth of loan portfolio during the last year. We are currently expecting that the national real estate portfolio attrition would remain fairly high, although perhaps somewhat slower over the next year than in the past year.","The energy portfolio attrition is well-documented as we have discussed this very regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. We expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. We expect the rate of decline to taper slightly, although possible factors such as resurgence of capital market activity in the space result in a fair amount of variability in the range of our outlook. To summarize, our outlook and loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which would be in the low to mid single digit rate of growth range.","On Slide 12, this provides more detail on loan yields. Specifically, the coupon on new loan production versus the total portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risks due to yield on loans in the current interest rate environment.","The yellow line reflects the GAAP loan yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for its decline is the previously mentioned impact related to loans purchased from the FDIC. Importantly, the weighted average coupon of loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon of course excludes the effective amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production declined 9 basis points from the prior quarter, essentially due a shift mix in production to somewhat larger loans in the third quarter when compared to the second, although not shown in this chart, the coupons in the various loan types and size cohorts were relatively stable with the exception of larger loans which remain under pressure. Although our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the smaller loans space, our production coupons have been stable.","Touching briefly on non-interest income and non-interest expense, our focus on fee income growth is generating good traction. I'm confident that the increased reporting and accountability that we have added to better track success in problem areas within [ph] fee income will result to materially stronger fee income growth than we have experienced in the past. And Harris has already discussed our non-interest expense and efficiency efforts, so I won't repeat them here. I will provide our expectations for non-interest income and non-interest expense when we come to our 12-month outlook summary.","One more item of note on the income statement. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 7 points lower -- 7 percentage points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter related to alternative energy and research and development. And all the effective tax rate was positively impacted by nearly $1 million of these one-time items in the third quarter. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to a more traditional 35% going forward.","Slide 11 breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 4 basis points from the second quarter to average 4.18%. Although there were various positives and negatives, the one that stands out as the primary driver of the overall loan yield decline was the decline in interest income related to loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. That portfolio has substantially outperformed relative to our expectations at that time. However, in the third quarter, the income was more in line with our modeled expectations, which resulted in a decline of income from those loans from approximately $12 million to $7 million.","This adversely impacted loan yields by about 5 basis points and reduced the net interest margin by about 3 basis points when compared to the second quarter. Our base case scenario for this pool of loans is that annualized earnings that we experienced in the third quarter, that level, will taper slightly as we move forward.","The securities portfolio yield declined this quarter due largely to the changing composition of portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. Shown at the bottom of the chart is our cost of funds as a percent of earning assets, which continues to be quite competitive. In addition to loan portfolio yield -- in addition to portfolio yield dynamics, the net interest margin was also adversely impacted by the shift in the mix of the balance sheet toward greater concentration of cash and securities, which carry a lower yield than the loan portfolio.","Turning to credit quality, on Slide 13, I'll be brief and say that we continued to experience generally strong credit quality performance in most geographies and segments. Within the C&I segment is most of the energy which we have discussed -- as we have discussed, has experienced some stress, and Scott will discuss that next.","Our reserves for credit loss is quite strong at 1.6 times our non-performing assets and nearly five years of debt charge-offs based on the third quarter annualized results. Despite the increase in classified energy loans of just over $110 million from the June 30 level, overall classified loans increased only $30 million in the third quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending in the Houston market more broadly.","Scott McLean","Thank you, Paul. And if you'll turn to Slide 14, you'll see the table that we also show on our earnings release, and let me just take -- let me just make some summary comments.","First, you'll note that the decline in energy loan outstandings and commitments and the classifieds have increased by approximately $118 million from June 30th. Both trends are as we had forecasted earlier in the year.","Second thing you'd note is that, we have indicated before that we have a number of methodologies we're using to project potential charge-offs, as noted previously, these various methodologies are still guiding us to an estimated energy losses of $75 million to $125 million for the cycle. A very manageable number given the overall size of our Company.","Although not on this slide, we have previously indicated in this release a continued build of our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 4%, a strong reserve, we believe, by any comparison.","As for charge-offs, we experienced in the third quarter, they're generally related companies that have been troubled since the last downturn and they're not really indicative of the underwriting we've been doing since the last downturn.","The next slide, Slide 15, frames the discussion about the Houston economic environment. The takeaways from this chart would include the fact that Houston has been one of the strongest job growth markets in the United States for years. In 2015, job growth is projected to be flat or possibly up by 10,000 to 20,000 jobs. You can see that, generally speaking, Houston has been generating anywhere from 80,000 to 110,000 jobs a year for the last four, five years. And that trend will slow to really a level of flat this -- for 2015.","Also while the mood among business owners is conservative today, as noted in the PMI chart, many other indicators such as housing, new car sales, hotel performance, all remain healthy, which may be at least partially attributable to the strong $20 billion plus in capital investment that's going into the petrochemical refining and LNG export sectors of the Texas Gulf Coast economy.","If you turn to Slide 16, drilling down into our commercial real estate -- the commercial real estate trends in, again, Houston. We do see some uptick in vacancy levels in office, both for multi-family and retail, two sectors that we have most of our other exposures and the vacancy levels are holding steady. Clearly, multi-family vacancies though will increase over time and rental rates will be under pressure. However, our multi-family projects that had been in lease-up during 2015, and it's approximately two-thirds of our multi-family portfolio in Houston, are experiencing rental rates above the levels estimated in our base case during the underwriting process.","Turning to Slide 17. Slide 17 shows an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left-handed side of each bar represents the Houston exposure, which has increased somewhat from the prior quarter due to various factors, including new originations, conversion to term CRE from construction, as the buildings have reached that service level that is consistent with our term commercial real estate underwriting standards, as well as draws on existing construction commitments.","We have a very conservative loan-to-value ratio and debt service coverage on the construction and term commercial real estate portfolios in Houston, and we expect this conservative underwriting to be a strength during this downturn. But obviously this is a situation that bears close monitoring, as we've discussed in the past. While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure in Texas which are worth mentioning.","When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us more conservatively today. They include, first, the fact that commercial real estate balances are about $1.2 billion less today than 2008 and our exposure to land is approximately $150 million today compared to approximately $950 million in the previous cycle. And this land exposure is well-seasoned and represents very little underwriting since the previous downturn.","Secondly, we've also trimmed our construction lending exposure and we've emphasized an increase sort of pivoted to term commercial real estate originations. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office in multi-family construction financing is significantly greater today as well than in the previous cycle. We'd be happy to talk about those elements as well.","Paul, I'll turn the call back to you.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Scott. I'll conclude our prepared remarks on Slide 18. This reflects our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter.","On loan balances, we are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans, due primarily to the factors already discussed today. On net interest income, we are maintaining our outlook for net interest income at moderately increasing, it does not include the effect of any rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect to benefit -- a benefit to annual net interest income of about $125 million for each 100 basis-point move in short-term rates.","We expect that non-interest income, excluding dividends and securities, gains and losses will increase moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. One note as we consolidate the charters, dividends from federal agencies, namely the Federal Home Loan Banks, will decline, and of course there's a relatively new risk that dividends on our Federal Reserve bank stock would also decline depending upon congressional action. But even with those headwinds, we are generally comfortable with the level of consensus.","As stated previously, we are committed to holding non-interest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for both 2015 and 2016, excluding severance and restructuring expenses. We remain comfortable with our flat to slightly positive outlook on the provision, assuming energy prices remain relatively stable.","As mentioned after -- as announced after the close of the market today, we expect to deploy up to $180 million of cash to tender for a portion of our preferred -- perpetual preferred stock and depository shares outstanding. This includes the tender premiums and accrued dividends, thus the paramount retired is expected to be less than $180 million. Ultimately we expect this action to reduce preferred dividend by about $10 million going forward.","James Abbott","Thanks, Paul. And Sabrina [ph], at this point in time, would you open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Hello everybody.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hi.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Just maybe one on energy and a follow-up. Scott, could you just share with us what the criticized [ph] balance was of energy loans in the quarter?","Scott McLean","Yes. Criticized outstandings for the total energy portfolio were about 23%.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Twenty-three percent.","Harris Simmons","It was -- I would just add --","Scott McLean","It was about 20% last quarter.","Harris Simmons","Yeah, it was about 20% last quarter, so, about $60 million or $70 million linked-quarter increase.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay. Scott, just to follow up on your comments, I found them interesting, the $75 million to $125 million of losses through the cycle. Could you give us a sense of the probability of default and loss given default assumptions or at least maybe ranges? Because your numbers are a little bit lower than what we're thinking. What's underlying that?","Scott McLean","Well, basically there's four methodologies that we've used, fundamentally. And one was our CCAR [ph] estimates, which basically had oil at about $50. And then we had a second methodology which was a credit-by-credit analysis, so it was a very bottoms-up review based on the specifics of each credit and their current grade and all the aspects of each one. So it was very much a bottoms-up analysis.","And then the two final types of analyses we've done. The first was taking the worst loss year we had, which was approximately 1% for a 12-month period, and applied it over a nine-quarter period. So we took our worst annual loss and assumed we had that same loss rate for nine quarters. So we're assuming kind of a U type experience here as opposed to the V which we experienced in 2008-2009. Nine quarter also tracks, obviously, nicely to the CCAR [ph] methodology.","And then the final version was we took our worst classified experience ever and we applied an aggressive loan loss rate to that. The four of those really triangulate around $75 million to $125 million.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Okay. Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining-Sparks. Your line is now open.","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","Thanks. I was -- one, to focus in on the period-end on the securities versus the average. The average was up about $650 million, but the period-end available for sale was up $1.4 billion. So it seems like there's some pretty significant hangover going into the fourth quarter to get some benefit there.","Paul Burdiss","Yeah, Marty, this is Paul. Thank for your question. That's exactly -- you characterized the numbers correctly, which is that we were growing the portfolio over the course of the quarter. So the ending ended up being about twice the average. And to your point, I would expect that ending balance to carry into the fourth quarter, with continued growth from here.","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","The mortgage-backed premium amortization, you highlight that, you didn't really put an impact around net interest margin. How much of that impact the quarter's margin?","Paul Burdiss","It wasn't -- the amortization itself was not a big impact, Marty. It was about --","Unidentified Company Representative","I think it's about 2 or 4 basis points.","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. I think it's about 3 basis points, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","Okay. And with the income from the FDIC loans, James, was that also offset in the expenses? So, was it kind of a move from net interest income to favorable expenses?","James Abbott","It's a good question. The impact on the non-interest expense was fairly insignificant actually. So I think we dropped half-a-million or $1 million in non-interest expense as a result of the reduced income from FDIC-supported loans. But -- and the absolute level of money that we're sharing with the FDIC, I think for the quarter was $1.5 million, Marty. So it wasn't a very substantial amount, the non-interest expense number.","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","Okay. And lastly, the $75 million to $125 million, just realm kind of park, how much of that has already been provided for, you know, just in percentages? What do you think you kind of got your hands already in the reserve? And thank you for the time today.","Scott McLean","Well, the reserve I mentioned was north of 4% and energy outstandings are about $2.8 billion. So it's -- the reserve is to the high end of that range.","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","Thanks.","Scott McLean","If not above it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Darst of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. Just around your original CCAR [ph] expectations of about $300 million of preferred redemption, you're doing $180 million now. Would you expect to do some more in the first half of 2016?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. We've got -- this is Paul -- we've got through June of 2016 to complete that $300 million. So we're doing the total cash value of $180 million today, and I would expect the balance of that to come in the first half of 2016.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then just as far as the $10 million reduction, how much of that -- is that here in the fourth or is that going to be the -- kind of the full run rate in first quarter 2016?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah, I wouldn't expect to see that full run rate until the first quarter of 2016.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then just on your provision guidance, for flat to slightly positive, so that's not off of this $18 million this quarter, is it? That's still off zero, right?","Scott McLean","It's off of zero, that's a good clarification. Thank you.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Okay, got it. Okay, thank you.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Hello. Thank you for taking the question.","On the 66%, sub-66% efficiency ratio target for 2016 and the low 60s for 2017, clearly you're sticking with that. But is there any shift in the makeup between revenues and expenses given that loan growth seems to be coming in a bit lighter than expected but maybe do more on the revenue side, on the expense side, to offset that?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah, I would tell you that we, you know, I think we still expect to see a little better loan growth as we go into 2016. But the fact of the matter is we're starting with a smaller portfolio than we thought we would have coming in to 2016. So I expect that we're going to have to be working very hard on the cost side.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","And then just following up, fees you're now talking about a slight to moderate growth rather than moderate growth previously. So what's changed in the thinking there?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I think we've got some headwinds, as I discussed in my prepared remarks. We've got the charter consolidation is going to lead to lower dividends from the Federal Home Loan Banks and then we've got this other potential Federal Reserve Bank dividend headwind to talk about. So we're just -- we're moderating our outlook in light of some of these other factors.","Harris Simmons","And Paul, I don't know if you want to go into a little detail on the Federal Home Loan Bank dividends and the fact that we have so many Federal Home Loan Bank memberships and --","Paul Burdiss","Certainly we can talk about that if there's interest. We've got -- because we've got several banks under the FHLB rules, you know, a bank belongs to the district that it resides, with the charter consolidation, we're going to have one bank, CBNA [ph], that's going to be based here in Salt Lake City, and as a result, our [inaudible] Federal Home Loan Bank shareholders' relationships and shareholdings will be collapsed into -- or consolidated I should into one Federal Home Loan Bank, and that will be the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines.","And as a result, the way the FHLB system works is there are minimum share ownerships for each bank, and those minimum share ownerships will go to zero among these other banks, and as a result, we're just left with less, fewer shares of FHLB stock, and therefore dividends will be just lower.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","First question. Scott, if I heard you right, I think you mentioned something about, we were talking about the energy deterioration that -- that the credits [ph] were deteriorating, and I think it was right to say they were bad credits or they were credits that you did last cycle or last downturn, they were not the credits that you would have underwritten since the last cycle. But I guess my question is, how much of the portfolio that you currently have, the $2.8 billion, actually relates to the last cycle, the borrowers from -- that might be a little more at risk than what you would have done now?","Scott McLean","Ken, thank you. You did hear me correctly, the charge-offs have fundamentally been borrowers that were weak in the last cycle, they've been kind of limping along, and for whatever reason, you know, we have not been able to get totally out, and this recent downturn was just kind of another very difficult blow to them.","But I would say, most of the underwriting, you know, we have sort of adverse selection in there, when you think about those transactions we charged-off, and there are just some you can't get away from, so, no matter how hard you try. And -- but I would say most of the portfolio is largely based on the underwriting that we've been doing, you know, we -- for the last four or five years.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Okay. And then the other question, just for Harris. When you think about loan growth, obviously it has come in a little bit weaker. I know you guys want to improve that, but how much flexibility or how much I guess different initiatives or incremental incentives can you offer to actually better loan growth? Or is it that you are just subject to the environment that you're in?","Harris Simmons","Well, it's clearly both. It's -- but there are tangible steps that we're trying to take to, you know, trying [ph] to understate within a very disciplined view about how we manage risk around here. I think that, you know, I for one have a concern that we may find ourselves set [ph] into another downturn before we see the economy strengthen a great deal again, I mean. So we're trying to be very careful.","But we are, for example, we've hired some additional mortgage loan officers. So we're out there with some additional feet on the street doing that. We are really working hard at kind of looking at the process internally for getting loans turned around, particularly smaller business loans and consumer credits, to get a better pull-through rate. So there are things of that sort that we are doing that we think don't compromise quality in any meaningful but that can help us amp up growth a little bit. But it is a tough environment.","We're also trying to be reasonably disciplined around pricing. I think we've got a really good pricing culture in the Company and discipline around that. And so we're trying to be careful. I mean, sometimes you have to cede some ground competitively, but that's at play as well in terms of being able to grow your portfolio. So, trying to balance all of those.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Understood. Okay. Thank you very much.","Harris Simmons","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson & Humphrey. Your line is now open.","Michael Young - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hello, this is Michael Young in for Jennifer.","Just had a question again on loan growth. You know, energy bank was about half of the loan growth sequentially this quarter. Can you just talk about your outlook, if that's, depending on energy and Texas being a little bit weaker and growing slower there ex the energy component, or do you expect a lift in some of the other areas to pick that up?","Harris Simmons","I would expect some lift in some other areas. One thing -- one of the things I would note about Texas is, I mean, the -- outside of Houston, things remain in reasonably strong shape. And so, I think it's, you know, I don't count Texas out as a place that we could see some growth in non-energy related growth. But the offset to that is going to be what happens in the energy portfolio down there.","Elsewhere, I expect that -- we've got some pretty good economies that we're working in. And the, you know, the prospect for growth, we're seeing growth in Colorado, we're seeing it in Utah, we're seeing it in California, and other markets that we're in. So I remain generally sanguine about what can be done in terms of loan growth.","Scott McLean","Just on a linked-quarter basis, I would just -- I'm not sure if this was the question -- part of the question. But of the $89 million worth of loan growth that we had for the quarter, energy actually experienced attrition of about $42 million. So the pockets of growth for the quarter anyway were Zions Bank, had about $52 million, California had about $117 million. Those were the two standouts on the strength, on the strong side.","Paul Burdiss","The -- one other thing I might mention about loan growth is that, I mean, we've had [inaudible] energy but also out of this national real estate portfolio, kind of low loan-to-value small business credits of commercial mortgages. And we're trying to -- we are looking at how we can slow down sort of the payoffs. We're seeing a lot of refinancing in the CRE book in the term portfolio. Everyone's trying to lock in long-term fixed-rate money, and so that's another area that we'll be focused on, is, you know, if there are ways that we might be able to slow that down a little bit, that would actually really help on the loan growth side.","Michael Young - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, great. Thanks for that.","And just one other question on the energy loan portfolio. Could you provide a breakdown of the classified loan percentages by type of -- like by buckets there I guess?","Scott McLean","Sure. This is Scott. The upstream classifieds are about 22%. Midstream about 5%. Energy services about 18%. Total energy 15 - 16%, sorry.","Michael Young - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay, great. That's all for me.","Scott McLean","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Paul, first question, on the $6.6 billion of securities portfolio versus your original $6 billion goal, so, are you -- how much more are you now planning to build on top of that? And the premium amortization pickup that you mentioned, that's just related to the portfolio build as opposed to it being a one-time item, correct?","Paul Burdiss","A lot of the -- I'll start with the last question first -- a lot of the amortization pickup is related to portfolio build, although within the portfolio we've seen some accelerated prepayments in, for example, Ginnie Mae ARMs that were originated before 2015, because of the change in the government fee program that occurred in January. But by and large, you're right, I mean proportionally, most of the pickup was related to the pickup in the size of the portfolio.","As it relates to portfolio size, we're going to continue to monitor that relative to our cash position. As you've noticed, we've continued to grow the portfolio but our kind of overnight money market position hasn't changed a whole lot, because we've continued to see a lot of demand deposit growth, which has been a very positive story. So we're going to continue, as it makes sense, we're going to continue growth in the AFS portfolio.","Kevin Usdin - Jefferies","Okay. And my second question --","Paul Burdiss","Sorry, I would remind you that that $6 billion includes a lot more than just mortgage-backed securities, right?","Kevin Usdin - Jefferies","Absolutely.","Paul Burdiss","Yeah.","Kevin Usdin - Jefferies","You mentioned -- we know about the debt reductions that one you did in mid-September and one that's coming mid-quarter. So I just want to understand, on Slide 18 you talked about the $8.6 million interest expense incurred. Is that what's going away from here, of it? Or I just want to understand, like what is the go-to long-term debt run rate versus the kind of, it looks like, $18 million, $19 million, you put -- you paid out around this quarter?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. The $8.6 million we quote there is the expense we incurred in the third quarter related to the two pieces of debt that are going away. One went away in September 15th and the other goes away November 16th. So, mid-September and mid-November. And as you know, these had rates on them approaching kind of combined 15%, 16%, and just under $250 million. So that's kind of how that math all comes together.","Kevin Usdin - Jefferies","So, both -- $8.6 million will be gone in the first quarter completely?","Paul Burdiss","Yes.","Kevin Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, got it. Just wanted to make sure on that. Thanks a lot.","Paul Burdiss","Yup.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Hey, good evening.","Unidentified Company Representative","Good evening.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","You guys have addressed most everything, but did want to follow up just on the credit. I guess this is the -- you had a small amount of recoveries in the quarter, maybe smaller than the previous quarters. Do you think you've pretty much run your course on kind of elevated recoveries going forward, just kind of curious kind of maybe what offsets you might have against maybe some additional credit costs related to energy?","Harris Simmons","I guess I would say that there are still a few rabbits now and then that jumped up and out, from the crisis era, but they will become fewer and farther between. I do -- I mean I'm aware of a couple probably we'll see in the next six months that are meaningful. But overall it's going to be lumpy and it's going to generally be trending down.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","Good afternoon.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hey, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","Back to credit, on that 75 to 125 in projected losses. At the high end that implies about a 4-1\/2% cum loss through cycle ratio, and that's only modestly higher, if I'm correct, than your 2008 loss experience on a cumulative basis, which was about 3%. So, is that 3% correct? And then secondly, it's only modestly higher, I'm just thinking this through, it seems like -- I would think that it would be a good amount higher than the 2008 cycle.","Scott McLean","Well, the, you know, our -- what we said is that our losses inception to date, so, from 1997 until the beginning of this year, call it 17 years, was $60 million net charge-offs. And so there's about 3% I guess depending on what period you want to measure it over. But this loss rate -- this loss rate by any measure would be certainly higher than what we experienced. So we really weren't relying on that historical loss experience. We took it into consideration, but we also used a, as I said, a 9-1\/4 duration to these loss methodologies.","So I mean, it's probably worthy of a longer answer, but there's -- I guess what I'm saying is that the $75 million to $125 million reflects a greater loss rate than we've experienced historically.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","Okay. All right. And then separately on the capital front. Would just want to get your thoughts on how a lot of these actions you're doing on the balance sheet and, you know, are impacting your position for CCAR [ph]. In other words, you're putting the cash to work, you paid down the -- or you punted the CDOs, you're paying down debt. And then you also have the change going to Basel III under the 2016 CCAR. So, how does that all position you from your perspective for 2016 CCAR [ph]? And has there been any changes to that estimate of that impact of all that stuff given some of the changes in the economy or in the rate environment and oil?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. John, I wouldn't say that our overall outlook has changed. I mean we'll see what the economic scenario looks like when the CCAR [ph] instructions come out. But to your point, we've done -- we've really tried to do a lot of things that we think will set us up well in the CCAR [ph] environment.","You know, the only countervailing influence to all the positive things is energy. I mean energy is kind of a question-mark with respect to kind of where commodity prices are going to go, but maybe more importantly, how the Federal Reserve is going to be treating that as it relates to their assumptions -- their economic assumptions in the CCAR [ph] scenario. So it's very, you know, it's very difficult to predict an outcome, as you know, with CCAR [ph]. But to your point, and I think you've made a lot of good points for me, we're doing a lot of things here to really control our own destiny as it relates to CCAR [ph].","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","Okay. Thank you.","James Abbott","John, I think I might just chime in a little bit, and maybe ask Scott to talk about some of the differences in the way that we've -- loans that we have on the books today in the energy portfolio versus ones that we had in the 2008\/09 timeframe, second lien, the presence of second liens would be one that comes to mind immediately.","Scott McLean","Sure. No, James. So we had some second lien financing going into the 2008\/09 downturn, we have zero today. Secondly, there was a trend then going in, in the 2007\/08 timeframe, where reserve-based borrowers were accessing the capital markets for really quite significant levels of junior debt -- junior capital, and to $200 million to $500 million, $1 billion tranches of senior unsecured subordinated debt, etcetera. So, total leverage was much higher.","We started to pull away from that just before the downturn in 2008, but we had more of that as did the whole industry in that downturn. And in this cycle, we've stayed away from that phenomenon pretty -- in a pretty diligent, disciplined way. And I will tell you that that tendency started coming back into the market all throughout 2014, a little bit of the second half of 2013. And so I think it's a good thing that we were able to stay away from transactions like that in this cycle.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah. And I think we've said it publicly before but we'll say it again, we essentially [ph] exited several loans during the 2014 timeframe that had --","Scott McLean","That had that characteristic. And I would also note that we, in terms of things that we're continuing to do, you know, our fundamental underwriting on oilfield service is -- had proved itself up to that last cycle, we've stayed very true to that discipline, and the private equity firms that we work with that we've commented on before, it's about six to seven private equity firms on the reserve base side, six to seven on the oilfield service side. They're the same group of private equity firms we've worked with, in some cases for 10 to 15 years. We were -- it's the same group that went through the last cycle that's going through this cycle with us. And so that is a real positive, because they supported their credits last time, generally speaking, and we've already seen them supporting their credit this time, although every cycle is not the same. But these are people we have strong relationships with.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hi, Joe.","Operator","Your line is now open.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Great. Scott, I was just curious if you could give us a little color on how the redetermination process is going so far relative to your expectations, and did that affect your reserving much at all this quarter?","Scott McLean","Joe, thanks for the question. I wish I could give you a real definitive answer, but the process is literally just starting. The deck we'll use this time will be about $45 on the short periods, and then as you know, we follow the curve out. It's a little flatter curve this time than the $50 deck we used in the spring. So that's a fundamental difference.","It'll be late November, early December before we fully captured all that. Our sense is, we saw our borrowing basis decline by about 11%, 10% in the spring redetermination. There's been a lot written about that, actually some of which has been pretty accurate, in terms of the industry, as to what will happen this time. They -- my sense is we'll see borrowing-based declines in that same range, 10%, probably north of that, for this go-around. And it could be 10 to 20, but my guess is it'll be on the kind of mid-teens declines.","And there are reasons for that, but -- anyway, it's all still to come. But I will tell you that none of, to answer your question, none of the current redetermination had an influence on our additional provisioning in the third quarter; however, we did go back and looked at our spring redetermination where the sensitivity case was $37.50. So that we had all our borrowing basis measured at 37.50 and we did focus in on that a bit harder. This was when, you know, prices were down around 40. And that guided us a bit on the additional provisioning we did in this quarter. Prices are now back up a bit. So, anyway. But we did look at 37.50 very carefully, and in this redetermination we'll be using sensitivities that are below 37.50.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Right. Okay, understood. That's helpful.","And then, Paul, I guess the other question for you, is just there is some discussion about the FHLB dividends, and I just wondered if you could quantify what those fees that may be lost and what's the timing of when that -- we might see that hit the income statement.","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. Timing is probably we'll see that in the first quarter. And I'll have to think about -- I'll work with James on disclosing on the dollar value.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Understand. Thank you.","James Abbott","Okay. We have -- Sabrina [ph], I'm going to interrupt you here just a second. We have six questions left and we have five minutes left. So we'll go lightning round, one question per person, and then we'll try to go very quickly at this point.","Operator","All right. Our next question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads - UBS","Good afternoon. I will take that message here.","So, can you just give a little color on sort of the lessons learned from the review of the oilfield services portfolio this quarter, and kind of thinking about what that -- what changed in terms of debt to EBITDA ratios or [inaudible] coverage, just kind of what you learned there and whether you think there's going to be more headwinds to that portfolio the next few quarters.","Scott McLean","Sure. And you're saying lessons learned this quarter?","David Eads - UBS","Because that's what's impacted, you know, that was the bigger issue this quarter, correct?","Scott McLean","Well, yes. But we said since last December that you would see oilfield service classifieds build in principally the third and the fourth quarter. We said you would see a little bit in the second quarter. This was all the way back to last December, we saw very little oilfield service move in the second quarter. We said back then it would happen in the third and fourth quarter, and so it is. And that's principally just based on the fact of when you receive financial statements, and there was a positive hangover from the end of last year in terms of activity that was going on for oilfield service companies. So I would say no real lessons learned in this quarter, it's exactly the way we thought it would play out.","I would say though that I'd be really careful, as banks quote debt to EBITDA numbers, you know, EBITDA numbers are going to be going down, those debt to EBITDA numbers are going to become really almost a useless statistic, because they'll be eye-popping. They wouldn't be anything you'd underwrite at. It was just going to be because of the vanishing EBITDA, so.","Unidentified Company Representative","And a couple, as we mentioned, David, a couple of the charge-offs were related to companies that were really stale, had been around for a long time and struggled. So it was -- it's -- yeah.","Unidentified Company Representative","And they were very close to the drillbit on the energy services side.","David Eads - UBS","All right. Thanks. I'll move along.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Your line is now open.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Yeah. Thank you very much. On the -- when you guys hand in your CCAR [ph], do you have -- is there higher rates factored into it? And we've heard a couple of companies say that they might have to back off some of their capital management because rates now are -- a lot of people are assuming now rates are not going to rise. Can you add some color on that?","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, I would say that our capital actions were pretty conservative in the last CCAR [ph], and I would not say that they were overly impacted by the prevailing rate environment in the Fed base case, which I think is what you're getting at. I mean we've got the dividend increase which you've already seen and then we've got the redemption, the tender of the preferred stock, which we're in the process of doing. And I would not expect the prevailing rate environment versus the Fed base case to impact that.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Hey, good afternoon guys. Just real quick back on the provision guidance. Not to split hairs too much here, but you're saying you're guiding to flat to slightly up from zero, but we're at $18 million this quarter. So it kind of sounds like you guys are effectively guiding for that provision to be lower from here. Is that right?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah, David, that's -- it's a good point of clarification. We -- the intention for the provision going forward is flat to slightly positive rather than flat to slightly positive from $18 million. So in other words, zero to $10 million to $15 million per quarter, something in the area of what we're thinking at this point.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Spahr of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","Thank you. This is related to what Ken asked earlier. The available-for-sale portfolio, the yield is 185. Given the emphasis on HQLA securities, do you expect that to go down lower or stabilize now?","Paul Burdiss","Well, that's going to be a function of the yield curve ultimately. But look, we're buying securities that have a yield that is in that kind of 1.50% to 2% range generally, is our either ARM products, like Ginnie Mae ARMs or pass-throughs of -- or 15-year pass-throughs. So it's in that -- it's going to be in the ballpark. But again it's going to be a function of kind of where rates go from here.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","So, all else equal, it might -- so, all else equal, it might be slightly lower but not the 14 bp delta that we saw this past quarter?","Paul Burdiss","Look, hard to predict, but yeah, I would expect it to start to level out.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of John Moran of Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","Hey. Thanks. Just a real quick question on the nature of the energy charge-offs this quarter. Do you have the split for RBL versus OFS? Because if I'm remembering correctly, the $60 million since inception, almost of that was RBL, which was a little bit counterintuitive.","Unidentified Company Representative","So, acronyms -- we got an acronym problem here. But OFS -- oilfield services and RBL is reserve-based lending for the uninitiated.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","Sorry about that.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah. No, that's fine.","And I would say, virtually all of this was oilfield services.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","Virtually all the 17 this quarter were -- that was services, okay.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","And then the expectation on the -- I'm sorry, I'm going to sneak a follow-up here -- the 125 being the top end of the range, how much of that do you think comes out of services versus reserve-based?","Scott McLean","You know, John, it's so hard to tell. I mean it was counterintuitive that, of our $60 million inception to date going into this year, $1 million was services, $59 million was reserve-based. If I had to speculate, it's going to be probably 70-30 oilfield service to reserve-based, maybe 60-40. It should tilt more to oilfield service. The longer this goes, the heavier the tilt and -- to oilfield service. And the lower prices. You know, these estimates are fundamentally for oil in a price range of $50 to kind of high 40s, up to $60, if we see prices dip back down into 40s or the 30s, we could see numbers north of what we've described. But we currently believe that high 40s to 60s is what we'll -- what we should experience.","Chris Spahr - CLSA","Got it. Thanks very much.","James Abbott","And we've got one follow-up from Paul.","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. Sorry, if I could follow up on the question about Federal Home Loan Bank dividends.","We reported or recorded a little under $5 million in FHLB dividends in 2014. So that'll give you an idea of the scale of that revenue that would be going away in 2016.","James Abbott","Thanks, Paul. And thank you all for joining. This concludes our call at this point. And we really appreciate you joining the call. I'll be around for a little while this evening if you have follow-up questions. You're welcome to give me a call or an email. And we look forward to seeing you at a conference in the future or on the next quarterly earnings call. Thank you again for your participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"23246":["Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2015  5:30 PM ET","Executives","James Abbott - IR","Harris Simmons - CEO","Doyle Arnold - VP and CFO","Scott McLean - President","Analysts","Steve Moss - Evercore ISI","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Kevin Barker - Compass Point","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","John Moran - Macquarie","Operator","Welcome to the Zions Bancorporation Fourth Quarter 2014 earnings call. This call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to James Abbott.","James Abbott","Thank you Jenny and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss the fourth quarter 2014 earnings. Our participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Scott McLean, President; and Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer.","I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although the actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. ","A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your question to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thanks very much James and welcome to all of you who are on the call and those on the East Coast, we can only say we wish we had some of the snow issues you\u2019re currently experiencing this evening here on our mountains. We could use it. Based on other calls we\u2019ve listened to, we expect that a major focus at this earnings call will be on our energy portfolio and we\u2019ve included a significant amount of information in the earnings release on that topic.","We expect some deterioration in the portfolio as a result of the sharp decline in energy prices, particularly if price levels remain low for a long period of time. However, we\u2019re also feeling very confident that we\u2019ve maintained strong underwriting discipline and risk management throughout the last several quarters and several years for that matter, and that in combination with our strong capital position and loan loss reserves, we should navigate this bump reasonably well. We\u2019ve asked Scott McLean our President to add further color in our prepared remarks here in a few minutes.","But before we turn to that discussion, I wanted to make a few comments about earnings for 2014 and the progress on some of our initiatives. The 2014 results improved from the prior year with net income applicable to common shareholders rising to $333 million from $294 million a year ago. We experienced relatively stable net interest income; despite two significant headwinds, the winding down of the FDIC supported loan portfolio and pricing pressure on new loans. 2015 net interest income should be the first year of increasing net interest income since 2008, which is very encouraging to us.","Fee income growth has not met our expectations, in part due to a slower pace of mortgage originations than was originally anticipated. Mortgage banking was a headwind for us and for the rest of the industry in 2014. With mortgage rates having inched down somewhat once again, we hope to see some help from increased mortgage banking activities in 2015. I\u2019ll save my comments on expenses until after I discuss some of our other initiatives, but we do expect revenue growth to exceed non-interest expense growth in 2015.","I\u2019d like to talk for a moment about debt and preferred share levels and the reductions we\u2019ve made. We made solid progress on reducing the effect of debt and preferred dividends on our earnings during this past year. Interest expense on debt declined $63 million to $123 million and using the fourth quarter results, the annualized rate was only 75 million. Dividends on preferred equity declined by $24 million to $72 million and we hope to continue to reduce costs in both of those areas in 2015.","A major thing for Zions for the past several years has also been to improve our capital ratios and strengthen the quality of that capital. Today our capital ratios are among the best in the industry, both in quality and quantity and we\u2019ve made significant progress in reducing the cost of such capital. To the extent that we see further slowing in the global economy, we believe we are very well positioned to weather that well. We've also invested a great deal in upgrading our risk management in the past few years and it shows in having a very low net charge-off ratio relative to the industry and a low non-performing loans ratio. We believe the actions taken in recent years have positioned the Company to experience less loan loss volatility than peers through the credit cycle.","Fee income in 2014 was higher than in 2013 although most of the difference is explained by security schemes and losses. We experienced solid growth in treasury management and credit card revenues. However these gains were partially offset by softness in mortgage related fee income. This area, fee income remains a major focus for us and we will continue to re-double our efforts in this area. ","We announced some technology initiatives about 18 months ago. As many of you know, we are significantly overhauling many of our information technology and accounting systems. This began as a risk management initiative but will have a cost savings impact to it as well. And I am pleased to report that our chart of accounts has been completely overhauled and the mid-January conversion to our new chart of accounts went extremely smoothly. We've reduced the total number of line items by well over half, simplifying our chart of accounts structure here in the Company. ","Other elements of our initiatives are all on schedule and costs are tracking slightly better than expected. While these initiatives have an expense today, we really do believe they are necessary to remain competitive out into the future and we believe we\u2019ll be able to become significantly more efficient as a result of changes.","On the expense front, related to our technology initiative, we're very focused on expense control. As technology advances we're able to reduce certain labor intensive tasks. We\u2019re still fine tuning our outlook for cost savings which should come from these technology initiatives and expect to provide you an outlook a little later this year. We've given an outlook for total non-interest expense to roughly equal $1.6 billion for 2014, and excluding the debt restructuring expense we came in at $1.61 billion. So very, very close to the target. ","With that overview I am going to ask Doyle Arnold to review the financial results. Doyle?","Doyle Arnold","Thank you, Harris. Good evening everyone, as noted in the release, the net income available to common for the full year is $333 million or a $1.71 per diluted common share, compared to $294 million or a $1.58 per diluted common share in 2013. For the fourth quarter we posted net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $73.2 million, which was $0.36 per diluted common share, compares to net earnings applicable to common of $79.1 million or $0.40 per diluted share for the third quarter.","The biggest swing factor by far in the fourth quarter compared to the third was a provision expense which increased $84 million was the amount on the change, from a negative $71 million to a positive $13 million. Much of the release in the allowance for credit losses in the third quarter was due to the sale of several $100 million construction loans in that quarter, which generally carry a high reserve ratio. But for the substantial decline in energy prices in the fourth quarter, we would have had another modest reserve release in the fourth quarter as we've previously indicated, because underlying credit quality metrics or statistics continue to improve during the quarter. ","I\u2019ll move on now to a brief review of some of the key revenue drivers. Average loans held for investment increased $278 million compared to third quarter and end of period balances increased $324 million. The pattern in this quarter was a little different than fourth quarter patterns for the last several years in that it occurred -- the growth occurred fairly steadily throughout the quarter and we did not see the sharp acceleration there in loan growth in the final weeks near the end of the quarter that we have in recent previous years. So that pickup at the end was not the outliner compared to the whole year pattern that it has been.","For 2014 as a whole, loan growth was approximately $1 billion or 2.6%, consistent with our outlook at the beginning of the year for slight to moderate loan growth. The increase was muted due to loan sales and participations for risk reduction purposes that we talked about last quarter, and also continued run off of loans from the national real-estate group, the latter being a pressure that we expect to continue through 2015.","We also expect growth in 2015 to be about in line with 2014. We see improved economies in most of our footprint, although Texas and Amegy Bank may likely produce slower growth this year than last, in part due to potential effects of the decline in energy prices and energy related activity.","Net interest income, despite the significant improvement in interest expense through debt reductions that were mentioned, net interest income declined slightly in 2014 due to the decline in margin on earning assets. The decline in interest income is largely due to the reduction in the benefit from the FDIC supported loans, something that we have indicated would be a significant headwind to revenue growth. Revenue from loans excluding those FDIC supported loan portfolios declined much more modestly, despite an increase in the size of the portfolio due to continued price pressure.","While we continue to experience pricing pressure, the decline in the loan yields in recent quarters has been more mild than it was a year or two ago. For the quarter, total net interest income was $430 million, a 3% increase from the prior quarter but essentially unchanged from the year ago period. Excluding the effect of the declining FDIC supported loan income over that period, net interest income actually increased about 5% compared to the year ago period, and most of that is attributable to the redemption of high cost debt which took place throughout the year 2014.","Compared to the prior quarter, the net interest margin increased 5 basis points to 3.25%. The strong deposit inflow of up to $1.6 billion or 3.4% sequentially and the slower loan growth resulted in an increase in average money market investments, which pressured the NIM by about 3 basis points.","The purchase of residential mortgage backed securities during the quarter pressured the NIM somewhat, but served to increase net interest income. The agency RMBS securities purchased at a duration of about 3.3 years and if rates were to rise by 200 basis points that duration would extend to about four years.","Turning to fee income, there is some noise in the number. During the quarter we experienced a $15 million increase in the valuation of an investment held at two small business investment Company funds, which was split between two line items because in one page we had a controlling interest in the fund and the other we did not. The two line items were dividends and equity securities gains. That $15 million increase was partially offset by marking to estimated realizable value certain other private equity fund investments that will be divested pursuant to the Volcker Rule.","I\u2019d also note there was a $12 million loss on the sale of CDO securities during the quarter. We sold about a 150 million par value of CDOs in the quarter, again for risk reduction purposes and that shows up in the fix income securities gains and losses line. There is no OTTI during the quarter, I believe.","For coming [ph] on non-interest expense, salaries and benefits decreased by about $7 million compared to the prior quarter. Much of the decrease is attributable to fact that we had $5 million of severance cost in the third quarter as discussed then and very de minimis severance cost included in this quarter. We also reversed an accrual for healthcare benefits where we have over accrued some expenses that came in little lower than projected.","Professional and legal increased $10 million from the prior quarter, mainly due to consulting fees related to the Company\u2019s CCAR processes, including model validations and preparation of the submission. We do hope and expect that that number will not be as significant as we prepare the next CCAR. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in institutionalizing some of that activity.","We continue to employ outside consultants however, working on technology projects and the replacement of the chart of accounts and financial reporting system, systems, which those projects are now on their kind of peak spending phases. These technology projects are key to our efforts to long-term control and reduce expenses and we expect as I said lower overall expenses in 2015 on the professional and legal line that we did this year.","With that overview, I\u2019m going to now turn sometime over to my colleague Scott McLean. For those of you who have not yet met Scott, he has been President of the Company for about a year, just under a year now, but prior to that spent several years as CEO of Amegy Bank and has been with Amegy Bank and other banks in the Houston area and very knowledgeable energy lending practices, both now and in the past and I\u2019m going to let Scott go into little bit more depth about energy portfolio. Scott?","Scott McLean","Great. Thanks, Doyle. I am happy to add some additional color of what we already put in the press release regarding energy lending as the way to reduce the uncertainty that I think comes from a lack of information and understanding when you go through a cycle like this. As Harris indicated earlier, we believe that our disciplined underwriting, strong capital and loan loss reserve positions position us well to whether this current period of oil and gas price volatility.","I want to try to highlight four key elements that should be helpful to you as you think about our exposure. First, as it regards historical losses on energy loans, they have been limited to approximately 1% in our peak year of 2009. Importantly, over the last seven years, cumulative losses were approximately 3% of the balance of loans outstanding entering that period. Relative to the loan portfolio, these charges offs -- relative to the overall loan portfolio of the Company, these charge offs have represented a very small number of basis points in our net charge off ratio.","Many of you will recall though that the price of oil dropped significantly, starting in the spring of 2008 and then rebounded within about 12 to 15 month period. And no one knows if oil prices will rebound from the current 50% plus decline in the last few months. However though it is also worth recalling that natural gas prices also fell significantly in the 2008-2009 period, and those prices have not rebounded fundamentally. Gas production was a very significant component of most exploration companies and impacted energy service companies\u2019 revenues as well at that time. And in many cases, it was more than 50% of total production back then. So losses from that period are certainly relevant to the current outlook.","The second comment I would make is that we\u2019ve had very disciplined underwriting process over the years, and as well, in the utilization of concentration limit. Both of these have effectively limited our energy loan growth to very modest rates in recent periods. Although this loan will not prevent all losses, it is very effective, concentration limits, and our approach to underwriting is -- are effective risk management tools that have held us in good stead in the last several years.","The third element I\u2019d like to mention is just the fact that are energy companies that are in our portfolio have other sources of support that differentiate them. These energy companies have access to capital markets and private equity sources beyond what many companies have. We saw good support from the private equity sponsors that are actively involved with many of our clients during the 2008-2009 downturn, whereas that source of support was really never there in the 1980s, which was another very notable period of price volatility.","Approximately 30% of our exposure in the energy portfolio is to public companies and approximately 45% have private equity sponsors. And the private equity firms we partner with have exceptionally strong experience in the industry and understand the cyclicality as opposed to generalist firms or younger, less experienced firms. Additionally, the remainder of our portfolio generally has private sponsors, very high net worth families that have been highly involved in the energy industry over the years.","Finally, the -- really the most important aspect I\u2019d like to describe is just the loan by loan basis that we have underwritten our portfolio by. And we believe it has historically allowed us, and will going forward allow us, to withstand a sharp decline in energy prices without experiencing a sharp increase in loan losses. I\u2019m going to repeat some of what is in the release, but I think it is worth punctuating.","It\u2019s important to know that we have no junior liens or subordinated debt in the portfolio. And we avoid equally as important making first lien loans if there is substantial leverage behind us as it raises default risk. Additionally, more than 90% of the portfolio is secure. The largest loans in our portfolio have an average loan grade that maps to a BB+ rating. This would be for all loan commitments that exceed 30 million in commitment value, which is about one quarter of our portfolio.","Of particular importance, during the underwriting process for reserve based loans, we apply multiple discounts to the value of the collateral as provided by the borrower and validated by third party engineering firms. I\u2019ll highlight here a few, and happy to take follow up questions on this as well because it\u2019s just so fundamental understanding the conservativeness of the underwriting process we use.","First, for a wide variety of reasons, we generally exclude from consideration much of a borrower\u2019s available collateral. This first discount often is in the range of 10% to 40% of the reserves that the borrower presents to us at the time of their request. Secondly the Bank\u2019s oil and gas price deck, the pricing that we apply to a borrower\u2019s reserves has historically been below the NYMEX strip at any particular current period.","Third borrowing bases are generally set at 60% to 70% of the available collaterals after the discounts that I just mentioned above. Additionally borrowers generally exercise caution and do not draw the maximum available cash on their lines. The line utilization rate on reserve based loan commitments was 57% at December 31, 2014.","This discussion in utilization gives us the ability to reduce a line of credit and many of customers would not experience the need to sell assets or raise equity to bring the loan back in the confirmative with the borrowing base. That said, our contracts require an equity cushion. So we will not separately sit on our hands if the loan to collateral value exceeds 95% or 100%. We are constantly working with our borrowers to reinstate an acceptable equity cushion at all times and quite frankly that is in their best interest as well.","Let me comment briefly about hedging, hedging commodity prices is a fairly common practice by our customers, with oil hedging representing about 50% of oil production in both 2015 and 2016. When hedging is not utilized sufficiently, we apply much steeper discounts to the collateral value when making a commitment. ","A few final comments regarding our energy services portfolio. Our energy services loans underwriting criteria requires lower leverage to compensate for the cyclical nature of that collection of industries. We shot cash flow EBITDA levels down significantly, up to 60% with an average of 33% to determine each borrower\u2019s viability under stress.","Many of our loans have debt to EBITDA ratios less than one in a quarter and the typical transaction has cash flow leverage in the one and a half range and below, which is quite conservative relative to industry norms for general, commercial and industrial lending. So individually, all of these steps that I\u2019ve referenced provides substantial protection, but taken together we feel we prepared to handle the situation that we currently face with oil and gas prices with a relatively modest impacts to net charge-offs and overall profitability. James?","James Abbott","Thank you, Scott. Next Doyle will provide the financial outlook and then we will take your questions. Doyle?","Doyle Arnold","Thanks James and thank you and Scott. Outlook is for the forward four quarters, relative to our most recent quarter. It\u2019s not meant to be a quarter-by-quarter prognostication, in kind of keeping with our past practice. Regarding loan growth, we\u2019re going to maintain our slight to moderate growth outlook for loans. This does factor in the effects of what could be a slowing Texas market for reasons we\u2019ve been talking about, but offset by strengthening economies in other parts of our footprint. Regarding net interest income, we expect that to increase slightly due to continued loan growth and modest securities purchases, although there will be pressure in the first quarter due to too fewer days in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So just bear that in mind.","So I just made a liar out of myself. I did talk about a specific quarter rather than the full year but don\u2019t be alarmed. We expect to redeem additional very high cost debt, subordinated debt in the third and fourth quarters, which will reduce interest expense late in this year. You won\u2019t even see the full benefit of that in fourth quarter, but you will through the year 2016.","Regarding non-interest income we expect the core components, such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend as we continue to strive for organic loan growth and fee income. On the non-interest expense side, our outlook for non-interest expense remains about the same for 2015, that is $405 million, $410 million per quarter, in other words kind of keeping overall expenses flat for another year or nearly so as the technology projects experience their expected peak year of incremental spend.","Regarding provision expense, that\u2019s probably the biggest change from 2014. At the current time we do not expect additional reserve releases in 2015. We do expect the provision will be positive for the year and likely for each quarter, driven by net charge-offs, loan growth and a possible increase in the adversely created loans in the energy book.","Net charge-offs for 2014 were approximately $42 million, which is a pretty low rate, even though it included couple of special situations. Nevertheless, with energy prices at current levels, NCOs could increase somewhat from that level, particularly later in the year as we get updated financials the take into account the full impact of what\u2019s been going on in the last couple of months with regard to energy prices.","With that, we\u2019ll turn it back to James and our operator to open the line for your questions.","James Abbott","Thanks, Jamie, if you would open up the line, that\u2019d be great.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI.","Steve Moss","It\u2019s actually Steve Moss for John. Just want to start off with the energy portfolio. Kind of wondering how much do you guys have in terms of reserves allocated to the portfolio?","Harris Simmons","The allowance for credit losses to the portfolio. It\u2019s in 1.75% to 2% area and Doyle, maybe do you want elaborate on why it\u2019s not a precise number?","Doyle Arnold","Well, it\u2019s not a precise number because you got to make some assumptions, particularly about how we allocate the qualitative portion of the reserve and for us the qualitative portion is a pretty significant component of the overall reserves, something on the order of about 30% of the total. But if you\u2019re thinking 1.75 to 1.8, maybe a bit more, that\u2019s probably the right area. And that takes into account something about the qualitative addition of $25 million roughly that we mentioned in the press release, specifically related to energy.","Steve Moss","Okay and then in terms of the -- you're looking the portfolio today versus stay back \u201808, \u201909. Is there any structural difference? Do you more service loans in the portfolio today versus backbench? Just kind of wondering what are the key differences. I know you mentioned gas before?","Scott McLean","I would say it\u2019s fundamentally -- this is Scott McLean. It\u2019s fundamentally the same mix. We may actually have a little more of midstream today than we did then, but it\u2019s fundamentally the same mix.","Harris Simmons","Do you want to talk about junior liens back then versus maybe today?","Scott McLean","Yes, back then we had -- we maybe had three or four junior liens in the portfolio, going into the \u201808, \u201809 downturn. I would say we probably have four or five they were small. And we have zero today. And we also, back -- going into that downturn, we had a few more, not many, but we had a few loans where there were large unsecured pieces behind us, senior unsecured that were issued in the public market or large junior subordinated pieces, where total leverage was higher and many of those worked just fine, but some did not. And so really some of the most important part of lessons learned coming out of the downturn were changes we made to not do any second lien financing and to generally avoid situations where total leverage is well beyond the bank senior borrowing base piece.","Harris Simmons","And one other change that will be applicable to the end of the industry as a whole Scott is that people in 2007 and \u201808 or \u201806, \u201807 year were drilling for dry gas only. Everything is much more balanced now, for better or for worse, but you\u2019re getting some of each.","Scott McLean","Yes, I would say then if you looked at the entire portfolio, it was probably 60% gas in terms of the borrowing base collateral, 40% oil and you\u2019ll recall the word pivot was used significantly following that. People were pivoting away from gas and they pivoted to oil. You\u2019ll now start reading about people pivoting back away from oil ever so slightly.","Harris Simmons","And for those you didn\u2019t follow that area, there was -- because gas did just well over $8 close to $9, I think per MCF and it fell down into the $2.5 to $4 range.","Scott McLean","It\u2019s stayed there.","Harris Simmons","It stayed in that range. So that\u2019s different in the production mix.","Steve Moss","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess one last question in terms of that price of credit. Are we seeing now, given that you\u2019re going to add to provision reserves going forward, has loan loss reserve bottomed here?","Harris Simmons","You mean the total dollars in reserve? I don\u2019t want to go precisely, because the provision may or may not fully cover charge-offs in any given quarter, but I think the year -- as we said all year last year, that the year of substantial reserve releases or negative provisions has probably come to an end for the time being.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to actually start on capital, looking at where you ended year, 12% tier one common. You obviously have a ton of capital. With that said you just raised common and now you\u2019re talking about quite a few certainties in the energy book. Is it too soon for you to consider asking for even a modest return of capital in the upcoming CCAR beyond, I don\u2019t know, maybe a token dividend increase?","Scott McLean","Well Steve the upcoming CCAR was already submitted. So whatever we submitted, we submitted. And I don\u2019t think we want to comment on what we submitted till we get the -- until [indiscernible] comes out of Washington. But I think -- I will note that we did -- we have said consistently that we\u2019re likely to remain somewhat cautious in doing major capital changes or asking for too much, given the closeness on the resubmission last year. We\u2019d like to get one more good read on how -- not only how we assess our risk --we think we\u2019re doing a very good job there -- but also how the federal reserve kind of assesses our risk. But we would agree with you. We\u2019ve got really strong capital ratios, both tier one common and also other -- when you add other tier one in, we\u2019ve got among the strong -- probably the strongest capital ratio of any CCAR institution down there and certainly in a bank like one.","Steven Alexopoulos","That\u2019s fair. Maybe to follow up, of the $3 billion, the energy exposure that you outlined, just to slice it a different way; what\u2019s the split between share national credit participations for larger energy companies and direct loans to smaller companies?","Scott McLean","Well the exact percentage I need to get for you. On the reserve base side, it\u2019s a much higher degree of shared national credits, because those credits are larger. We generally do not participate -- we don\u2019t originate a lot of $5 million and $10 million reserve base loans, because the collateral pools are generally much more limited and they are higher risk because of that. So generally speaking, the transactions ran on a reserve base side or anywhere from $20 million $25 million up to hundreds of millions of dollars, syndicated transactions. So the percentage though would be pretty significant, because the dollar amounts are larger. And the folks that we\u2019re participating with, when we don\u2019t lead, we lead about 25% of the time plus or minus where we are considered to lead. The rest of the time, we are with a small number of highly experienced underwriters, that you would know them if I named them. And it\u2019s not -- there\u2019s not 10 of them. There\u2019s about four or five that we work with. And so in that sense, we think that gives us strength.","On the energy services side, the percentage of syndicated transactions there would be much lower. And although -- you do a see a lot of club financing that goes on there. Even for $20 million and $30 million transactions you\u2019ll see -- it\u2019s not unusual to see two banks in a $20 million to $30 million deal as a risk mitigation tool.","Steven Alexopoulos","And do you just have the dollars of shared national credits that are in the energy sector? Just what that balance is?","Doyle Arnold","Yes we might be able to get that for you, while we\u2019re on the call, but I would -- I can't quote it off the top of my head.","Harris Simmons","It\u2019s not -- we\u2019ll try to get back you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank.","Dave Rochester","Just on credit again. I was wondering, if there were any other reserve impacts on the energy book this quarter other than that $25 million qualitative adjustment? And then given your comment on the potential for downgrades to come from the rebalancing, should we expect that rebalancing is going to be fully reflected in the reserve by the end of 2Q, would you think?","Harris Simmons","Well two parts to the question. As we mentioned in the press release, we did attempt to look at the portfolio, the actual credits during the quarter and even into late December. Difficult to do a full re-underwriting and certainly not a full reengineering of the reserves and what not, but on that -- based on that, there were a few downgrades, a couple to criticize our classified status and a few more still within a pass grade, but a lower pass grade. That did have some impact on the reserve, maybe just a few million dollars, but not -- the bigger part was the qualitative adjustment we made, because based on various sensitivity analysis, we became convinced that there very likely were incurred losses there that just we couldn\u2019t fully figure it out by the end of the quarter in terms of a traditional analysis, that what we think -- which we think will show up.","One possible pattern over the course of the year is that there will be some shift from the qualitative into the quantitative part of the reserve, as we get financial information from the borrowers. But the -- that process won\u2019t be complete certainly by the end of Q1. We\u2019d probably get the first real financials that began to show an impact sometime in Q3 -- Q2 and I would expect even if prices don\u2019t move at all, we\u2019ll -- we won\u2019t have fully kind of seen the impact until maybe Q3-Q4. But again there may be some, there potentially will be some downgrades, but some of this will be absorbed potentially by a shift from the qualitative into the quantitative portion of the reserve. We just don't know yet.","Dave Rochester","And what level of oil prices do you use for your rebalancing analysis? Are you using some kind of three month average, or how do you project those out as a factor in that rebalancing? ","Harris Simmons","We use the -- basically the NYMEX strip and so\u2026","Scott McLean","Which is a WTI West Texas Intermediate crude forward price curve.","Harris Simmons","Right. And so the current price that you see is you have to look at the forward curve to really see how we evaluate it, because the production obviously takes place, depending on the reserves over a three month to 15 year basis. ","Scott McLean","That curve today would start with -- today\u2019s spot price and then it gradually gets up into the 50s over the next couple of years.","Harris Simmons","That's correct. And I think the other thing that's important to know is that when you look at historical oil prices as an example; when the price of oil was a 140 in early 2008, our borrowing base -- our price deck was in the sort of low 80 range; and if you look at the underwriting we were doing throughout 2010, '11 and '12, our price deck was generally in the $70 to $80 range. So that's important to know. It's -- we never used a price deck that was $90 or a $100, even when the price was there. ","Dave Rochester","And just one last one. You had mentioned you're expecting loan growth in 2015, generally in line with what you had in 2014, that Texas would be slower. We're just wondering, are you assuming a flat energy book or some run-off there? ","Harris Simmons","Some run-off there. There's definitely some. ","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. ","Ken Zerbe","Along the same lines, I guess as the last question. In terms of the indirect impact of low oil on the entire Amegy book, what's the likelihood that you see such a contraction in CapEx, in drilling and it just has a carryover effect on jobs, on sort of all the ancillary businesses in the broader Texas economy, that you end up seeing a fairly meaningful decline in your total Amegy loan portfolio? ","Harris Simmons","Let me -- why don\u2019t I take that also. It's a logical question to ask about sort of the ripple effects of all this, and I think the most important thing to start with is that the real estate exposure in the Texas Bank was about $3.6 billion in outstanding's in 2008. At the end of 2014 it was $2.4 billion. So the exposure to land A and B was $989 million in 2008. It's a $149 million today. So our total real estate exposure is significantly less, our land exposure is almost negligible. And so real-estate is the natural place where oil and gas price volatility turns when it has a ripple effect.","The other comment I would make to you -- I'm not about to try to explain to you that the Houston economy and Texas will be immune to this. There will absolutely be an impact on those economies. But there is one secular change that will be a strength for Houston and Texas this time around, compared to '08, '09 and any other period of decline, and that is the benefit of low natural gas prices. There -- if you look at the announcements that have been made for major petrochemical expansions all along the Houston ship channel, it is billions and billions of dollars of construction that is all based on natural gas prices remaining low, which I think most people generally believe they will. So that is driving -- is one of the drivers of the economy there right now and will certainly cushion from this oil price volatility we're seeing today. ","Ken Zerbe","Okay. And then just one other question. In terms of -- I guess if we look a year from now right, I now understand you built qualitative reserves on energy. Barring $10 a barrel oil, where could you be wrong? Where could we end up 12 months from now with meaningfully higher losses on the energy portfolio? What would be the drivers of that? ","Scott McLean","Well I would say that -- well first of all, it's impossible to know, but secondly it's going to have to be an 18 to 36 month period I think for losses that would exceed our historical experience. The losses we've had historically have been modest relative to the corporate charge-off ratio and our capital. They're almost negligible. And you would have to have 24 to 36 months of extended decline. Because again remember most borrowing bases are generally 50% to 60% gas and some are -- many are 60% oil, okay. But there is always a balance, almost always a balance of some kind. And so we\u2019ve been in an extended period of low gas prices. So when you think about our exposure, you need to think about kind of 50% to 60% of the portfolio that is really being exposed to this volatility, because the part that's going to expose the gas has been living with a low gas price for a long time.","Doyle Arnold","I think I would add that a $25 million qualitative addition to the reserve is kind of under an accounting or GAAP incurred loss model, what we could reasonably assert is appropriate today. If this goes on for -- as Scott said, for an extended period of time, a couple of years, three years, where oil prices remain very low, there will almost undoubtedly, based on our sensitivity analysis be some additional increments to the provision related to that, and some [indiscernible] classified -- more criticized and classified loans and it will begin to shift again toward the quantitative side is as we -- as Warren Buffett once said, when the time goes out, we see who has been swimming without a bathing suit in the portfolio, and the few of those will show up over time. But bear in mind that even several times that $25 million spread out over a couple of years would equate to 10 to 15 basis points of charge-offs on the reserve -- on the portfolio as a whole on an annualized basis.","Harris Simmons","On an annualized basis. And other thing just to keep in mind is that this is 8% of the portfolio. So there is 92% of the portfolio that stands to benefit in some fashion, particularly in the California markets and so forth that have real estate exposure with 10 year treasury where it is. That will support the valuations of those properties quite nicely. I think we need to move to the next question. Thanks Ken, really appreciate your. ","James Abbott","I think we\u2019re going to let us to a one question and may be one quick follow-up. We have quite a few people still waiting and we'd like to try to give everybody at least one shot.","Operator","The next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Jennifer Demba ","A question on energy for Scott. Scott, in terms of the shared -- the energy shared national credits that you have where you are not an agent, what is your leeway in terms of operating those credits more adversely than an agent would or sooner [indiscernible] if at all?","Scott McLean","Jennifer, thank you and let me -- as I answer that, I want to punctuate one of the questions that was asked earlier. I didn\u2019t know off the top of my head the percentages, but we did in fact have it right here. So the percentage of shared national credits in the upstream portfolio, the reserve based portfolio is 80%. I said it was a large percentage, and it in fact is. In the midstream portfolio, it's 85% shared national credit. Those are always very large transactions. And in the oilfield service sector it's 50% shared national credits. And to answer your question\u2026","Harris Simmons","And those are both, ones we lead and ones we participate. That\u2019s a whole thing.","Scott McLean","Yes. And to answer your question, generally speaking on shared national credits, we are right in sync with where the agent is if we\u2019re not the agent and as I said, it is really important to understand that the number of agents we deal with is very small. So we\u2019re not being exposed to just the random experience of random players in the market and there are a lot of those that do not have the experience that we have or these other major underwriters have. The other thing I would comment on is that as you know annually the -- our regulators review all shared national credits, and rarely do we have a difference in grade from what the regulators would have thought or the agent would have thought. So it just -- it doesn\u2019t really happen that often."," Operator","The next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford ","I'll actually start with my quick follow-up, and that would just be on the energy portfolio. You did see little over $200 million of growth and nearly 4% in the quarter. Too much of that was just draws on existing lines or perhaps some growth you wouldn\u2019t -- you\u2019d rather not see and do you expect much more of that as the year progresses?","Scott McLean","I would be speculating to a certain degree, but generally speaking I would say it was probably more related to draws, because the fourth quarter for many energy services companies was one of the strongest quarters in their recent history; and secondly for reserve based companies, most of our reserve base clients had very robust drilling budgets in 2014, and generally in the industry, they are drilling hard in the fourth quarter to drill up the budgets that they have. So, I would guess its more utilization than absolute new transactions.","Doyle Arnold","Joe, we -- on page three of the release, we kind of give you a breakdown of that. You can see in the table that total commitments increased 224 million. The unfunded portion or unused portion increased $100 million. So the funding has increased a bit disproportionately there.","Joe Morford ","The other quick question was just on -- longer term on the efficiency ratio and depending on how you want to back out certain non-recurring stuff, you'd come in with say a level around 70% currently. And where do you see that going longer term, particularly as you finish -- complete the system\u2019s conversion and perhaps see a little higher rate environment too?","Harris Simmons","Yes. This is Harris. I'll take that Joe. There are obviously a variety of factors that go into that, some of which are in the denominator in the revenue piece, the most significant of which is the asset sensitivity we have, and that contributes -- roughly as I look at kind of the size of some of our peer\u2019s MBS portfolios, over 5 percentage points to the ratio. My expectation is that we get this down into the low 60s if you adjust for that piece of it. So in a little more normal rate environment I think that\u2019s achievable. And ultimately I would hope that we can drive it beyond that, but I think we\u2019re going to have to get through these systems projects to do that. The systems projects -- in 2015 we expect will contribute about $37 million in incremental spend.","Scott McLean","Compared to about $26 million.","Harris Simmons","Compared to about $26 million in 2014, so that still -- that's the way on it. But if I adjust for that, and if I adjust for the asset sensitivity, my expectation is that we get it down into kind of the low 60s.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Just a follow up on expenses and things you can control. So I wanted to just ask, as you think about that absolute dollar increase that you just mentioned this year; A, do you have a better line of sight though? Could we start getting it below this 405 - 410 as you think about next year? And underneath that, my follow up would just be, unfortunately we\u2019re going to lose this benefit that we have had from provision this year. So anything else that you guys are thinking about as far as underlying rationalization? I know you guys had talked a little bit about [indiscernible] et cetera. So just in terms of what you can control, any updated thoughts on when you can see that cascading, and other programs that you might be thinking about? ","Harris Simmons","Sure. Well, we are actually looking at every line item in the expense portion of the P&L, and have in fact taken some steps that will -- I would expect will offset certainly the incremental increase in the project spend this coming year. But they are in areas like travel and entertainment and some of the consulting expenses, et cetera, et cetera.","Going out a little further, we know that there are going to be some opportunities that come to us as we complete some of these systems projects that will allow us to consolidate some of the back office functions that have not been possible to consolidate until we get through some of the systems work. And I\u2019d be getting the cart the before the horse to start to put numbers to those. But I would expect that during this year we\u2019ll be giving you a little more information about some of the targets we have.","Operator","The next question comes from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neill.","Brad Milsaps","Doyle, I know you guys call in the release that deposit growth is typically really strong in the fourth quarter. This quarter looked maybe even stronger than it has been for the last couple of years. Anything in particular driving that aside from seasonality, and how does that did and\/or do you expect a lot of it to exit maybe the first part of the year? Just trying to get a better sense of balance sheet size and how you\u2019re thinking about managing liquidity?","Doyle Arnold","That growth was -- you're correct. It was a bit stronger even than the usual seasonal strength. And I don\u2019t think there is any one major thing that we can point to. It was fairly wide spread and kind of looks like for whatever reason customers wanting to show lots of liquidity on their balance sheet going into year end. We do expect some of that to probably run off. The growth was so strong, I'm not sure where we\u2019ll end up, but as people -- we usually see another uptick right around the first few weeks in April, as people start building balances for the estimated tax payments and then it comes down. But that one was hard to figure. And it did drive the overall size of the whole balance sheet this quarter.","Brad Milsaps","Sure. And just a follow up. I know you talk about the CMO purchase. With rates where they are, are you -- would you back off some of that and stick with just keeping it very, very liquid in short term or what are your thoughts there?","Doyle Arnold","Well, we don\u2019t really know. We have been -- if you look at the amount of cash we have and the rate at which we\u2019ve been buying, it would take quite a while to convert all of that cash into -- I would say not CMOs, it\u2019s RMBS really; and part of agency and relatively pointed out, if you kind of look at the map, we\u2019re trying to keep the duration, even of what we\u2019re buying relatively short as RMBS securities go so as not to give up too much of the asset sensitivity too quick. But we haven\u2019t decided how long and how to continue that program, but at the moment it is ongoing.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Unidentified Analyst ","Good afternoon guys. It\u2019s actually Thomas on for Paul. One quick question. On your sort of guidance that margin may sort of stay flat, mostly driven by reduced debt cost going forward, are there any -- we cover a couple of other companies that are sort of baking in an assumption for higher rates in the back half of \u201815. Is there any assumption on the asset side there?","Doyle Arnold","No, we did not. We did not try to forecast the rise in rates in the later part of the year. If that occurs, it\u2019s probably a benefit to the margin that\u2019s outside the guidance.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful.","Doyle Arnold","That addressed what you said? Okay.","Unidentified Analyst ","Yes, exactly that\u2019s all. I'll let someone else out there.","Doyle Arnold","Again, I think we need to clarify. We actually do expect net interest income to increase during 2015. So we didn\u2019t say flat. We do --","Unidentified Analyst ","Well right, but margin would be stable and then you'd get a pick in net interest income from --","Doyle Arnold","Right, from loan growth.","Unidentified Analyst ","Yes, exactly.","Doyle Arnold","The securities purchases, yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Barker from Compass Point.","Kevin Barker ","I was hoping you can expand upon some of the comments you made in December regarding potential reduction of preferred stock or in order to reduce the capital intensity on your balance sheet.","Scott McLean","I think for the time being I will just note that going into 2014 we had a pretty high level of debt and we took actions to reduce that. Going into \u201815 we had probably the third highest, maybe fourth -- pretty close there, Tier 1 common ratio among the bank wide CCAR institutions and when you add preferred and non-common tier 1, we're by a margin the highest. So over time we\u2019ll be looking at that preferred stock layer. That is subject to CCAR and unlike arguably senior debt, maybe a little more flexibility there. So I\u2019ll just leave it at we have more pure on common tier 1 [ph] than relative to our size in any other institution like us and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll be taking a look at.","Operator","The next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott ","In terms of the $25 million oil field on energy, I know you mentioned your constrained by GAAP accounting, that you're having some sensitivities and came off with that number. Could you give us a bit more detail on how you've reached the $25 million and why is $25 million, why it's not $50 million, why it's not $10 million? How are you kind of able to hold in on a particular number there?","Scott McLean","Well, if there were that much science, it probably wouldn\u2019t be qualitative. It would be in the quantitative part of the reserve.","Geoffrey Elliott ","Maybe [indiscernible], why can you do 25, thus you can't give a bigger number because the accountants wouldn\u2019t be happy with it. What are they looking at?","Scott McLean","We look at a variety of things. We did look at kind of individual credits, we did. We ran some kind of high level sensitivities on the portfolio; what if energy prices stayed down at this level for a very extended period of time. But that\u2019s kind of getting at -- that begins to shade into an expected loss thing as I mentioned.","Going back to an earlier question about capital and what not, I would just note, we stressed the energy portfolio pretty hard in our CCAR submission. It just happens that we decided back in late September to use shock oil down to $50 a barrel in our CCAR submission and we shocked the mining employment, which was another driver of our models pretty hard. So we have the benefit of being able to look at kind of in the CCAR what might those -- the energy component of the overall highly stressed losses be if they extended for a very long period of time.","But again under GAAP you can\u2019t do expected loss. You have to do incurred loss and almost by definition. That is something less than expected loss, projecting future economic conditions. And so at the end of the day it does become judgmental. It is a qualitative portion. It\u2019s not quantitative. So what we\u2019ve booked in the reserve is less than what might eventually happen if, if, if, if, if, and -- but it\u2019s what we felt was reasonable, prudent under an incurred loss accounting structure today.","Harris Simmons","And it does -- there is some framework around even how we did the qualitative piece.","Scott McLean","Yes.","Harris Simmons","So we have some factors that we adjusted and this is what falls out of it.","Scott McLean","Yes, there is a whole list of criteria that we utilized in the qualitative assessment that drive a quantitative outcome in terms of creating a qualitative number, but it\u2019s -- but there is a great deal of judgment that goes into that.","Operator","The next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining-Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Just a quick follow-up too. You talked about the expense increase of about $37 million from the overall systems conversions and the back office technology. Qualitatively how has the project being going, and just was curious, are you hitting your milestones or what surprises you might have run into so far?","Harris Simmons","We completed accounting -- chart of accounts conversion on time and slightly under budget just last weekend and our controller is standing up and walking around the table taking a victory lap as we tell you this, but I\u2019ll let -- the other projects are proceeding reasonable well. Scott do you want to?","Scott McLean","Sure, and first let me just clarify, and Harris noted it, but the $37 million estimate he referenced for 2015, incremental spending on these projects would compare to about $24 million to $25 million in 2014. So it\u2019s an increase there, not an absolute number.","Harris Simmons","We use the term incremental a little differently than people on the phone might be. So we\u2019re talking -- these are expenses that are outside of our normal employee -- that we're spending on consulting services and other processes.","Scott McLean","So we have a lot of internal employees who are working would otherwise be doing other kinds of project work, who have been assigned to this task. And so the incremental amount we\u2019re talking about is incremental to kind of the normal run rate for those internal employees.","Harris Simmons","And maybe said just a little differently or to add to that, just in terms of absolute dollar amounts, about $14 million was spent in the fourth quarter, all in on the systems and we expect the spend at similar amount throughout 2015 quarter by quarter. There is some fluctuation obviously but that\u2019s about the amount.","Marty Mosby","And then just qualitatively about progress, on the other systems outside accounting?","Harris Simmons","It\u2019s not that.","Scott McLean","So again the chart of the gas project was right on time. The original date was that we would convert on January 20th, and that\u2019s when we converted. There are several other phases to that, but that was the most significant credit lead, which we were [indiscernible] for our frontend loan underwriting origination system, all the way to the backend has been implemented in our Arizona and Nevada subsidiaries, and will be implemented in Colorado in the next 30 days; and Amegy in the early spring with California and Zions First National Bank following in the summer, early fall. So it is right on track and it\u2019s very much living up to the expectations that we had hoped. So that\u2019s going well.","And our enterprise loan operations initiative, which is basically converting from 15 different loan operations sites, that used multiple different incidences of our free loan systems, they will be converting to two loan operations centers, fundamentally using the same instances of the loan centers over time -- the loan systems over time. And that is underway and on track, and that will be completed by the end of this year for the most part. But the majority of it will be completely by the mid to late fall. So it\u2019s progressing very nicely.","And the big core operating systems, there are three releases. The first release is our retail loan system. It comes in the second quarter of \u201916. The second release is our commercial loan portion of that system. It will come in 2017, early \u201917. And then the deposits portion of the system will come in 2018, early in the year. But it\u2019s all going well and we\u2019re actively working on as well the efficiencies and cost savings that we anticipate from this significant simplification of our back office.","James Abbott","Okay and I think we\u2019ll take our last question here.","Operator","The final question comes from John Moran from Macquarie.","John Moran","Just a quick on construction and land development, I just noticed that the balances were up in the quarter. And after obviously last quarter you guys had taken some moves to kind of to mitigate risk. With CCAR submitted, is there more willingness, ability, desire to kind of grow that book, or is this quarter kind of one-off? And then maybe an update on -- I know that you were working on some syndication capability there. If you have any update there?","Scott McLean","The growth on balances this quarter is a result of commitments made some quarters ago. They don\u2019t just happen. We took a lot of action to reduce commitments in the second and third quarters last year. The concentration limits that we've put in place will allow only very modest growth in that category of loan going forward. It was not -- it was a won and done in the sense of just a major reduction from where we were. It was not -- but ongoing to have growth -- it's not going to snap right back. It was not just a get it down for September 30th and then only-only income free do whatever you want. It will be constrained to a lower level of growth going forward.","Harris Simmons","I\u2019ll just note it's about 5% of total loans, and that\u2019s less in a quarter or what it was at peak. And it\u2019s not going anywhere close to even halfway where it was at the peak. There\u2019s some room for a little bit of growth there, but it\u2019s going to be reasonably constrained.","James Abbott","Okay. Thank you very much for all of your questions today. We appreciate them and hopefully this has been helpful for you. I\u2019ll be available to take questions or follow up questions throughout the week. And I will see you at our conference sometime soon in this quarter. Thanks so much.","Harris Simmons","Thank you all very much.","Scott McLean","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference for today. Again thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day."],"23178":["Zions Bancorp. (NASDAQ:ZION) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 22, 2012  5:30 PM ET","Executives","James R.

And welcome to the Zions Bancorporation Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. And now, my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. James Abbott. Sir, the floor is yours.","James R. Abbott","Thank you, Hewey, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2012 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris H. Simmons","Thank you very much, James, and welcome to all of you. We're reasonably encouraged with the third quarter's results, with many of the metrics improving compared to the prior periods. The most notable accomplishment of the quarter, as you might imagine, was the completion of our repayment of the -- our TARP preferred stock obligation and redemption of that stock, which is encouraging to us. Good to have that chapter behind us.","Looking at the fundamentals, at a high level, we saw further strengthening of loan growth during the quarter. Our core net interest income declined, but at a slower rate than in the prior quarter, and our noninterest expenses also declined. Credit quality improved pretty materially in almost all categories and geographies. And finally, our capital improved, with tangible common equity increasing more than $100 million over the past 3 months.","Looking at loan growth, we experienced more than $360 million of growth in our C&I portfolio. It's about 14% annualized, up from $225 million last quarter. We also saw strong growth in our 1-4 family loan portfolio, about 16% annualized, and moderate growth at about 6% annualized in terms CRE. There's some offset in our owner-occupied and construction development portfolios. But overall, we certainly are pleased to see some of the major categories strengthening in a way that we're very pleased with.  Geographically, Utah and Idaho showed the strongest growth, with solid performances from Texas, Arizona and Colorado.","It's difficult to be precise about where our loan growth goes from here. There's much uncertainty about the business landscape as we have today. But we believe we'll continue to see moderate loan growth over the next year. We have construction commitments that have been growing somewhat and the equity going in first, and so we do expect that we'll see some strengthening in some of those balances, for example.","Looking at net interest income, the core net interest income declined about $5 million compared to the prior quarter, which is a slower rate of decline than the most recent few quarters. In the past 6 months, our core net interest income has experienced some particularly strong headwinds, and we note that the recent roughly 10-basis-point drop in 3-month LIBOR will produce some pressure on net interest income further in the fourth quarter. But our analysis of rate resets on both loans and securities points to moderating pressure over the next 12 to 18 months from that source.","Our guidance since January has been for core net interest income to be stable to slightly lower over the course of the year ahead, and we continue to believe that we should be able to generate enough loan growth over the next 12 months to offset most of the pressure inherent in our earning asset base.","One of the drivers of an improving net interest income will be an improvement in small business lending, which is a core element of our customer base. Nationally, small businesses have been slower than some larger businesses to emerge from recession. However, more small business customers have indicated an improvement in sentiment compared to just a few months ago, although the economic and political uncertainty, the fiscal cliff, et cetera, could certainly create an adverse change in that modest improvement.","Credit quality is something we continue to be very pleased with. I'm particularly encouraged with the drop in OREO expenses to nearly 0. And while this may not be sustained, there is a positive trend in collateral values within many of our markets, which is leading to gains on sale of some of our foreclosed real estate relative to book values. You can also see the effects of this and the improvement in the effective yield on FDIC-supported loans and in the 20% linked-quarter decline in gross charge-offs.","So those are some of the highlights. I'll turn the time over to Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. As noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common of $62.3 million or $0.34 per diluted common share for the quarter. As we exclude the noncash expense associated with sub debt amortization from our modified sub debt, revenue from FDIC loan discount accretion and the onetime preferred dividend associated with the accretion and the remaining discount on the TARP preferred stock and earnings available to common was $0.46 a share.","To give you an idea of what the run rate would've been for the quarter, if we exclude the regular TARP dividend of about $9 million for the quarter, which will not be present in the fourth and future quarters, earnings available to common would have been $0.51 per share, which translates into a return on financial common equity of approximately 10%.","Turning to revenue drivers. As Harris noted earlier, we were reasonably pleased with the amount of loan growth, which was relatively broad-based. Origination volumes for new loans as well as renewals increased about 5% from the prior quarter and increased about 17% from the year-ago period. And the pipelines for our various affiliate banks remain fairly healthy.","Turning from volume to rate, if we hold product mix constant, the coupon yield on loan production declined at a relatively similar pace compared to the prior quarter. And our experience was fairly consistent with the national data regarding commercial loan pricing. Lenders are indicating that the competitive environment, that's our lenders, that is, are indicating that the competitive environment for larger and middle-sized loans is beginning to show signs of stability. However, small business price competition has increased somewhat in recent weeks, and there are a relatively small number of customers that are qualified to borrow, making the marketplace a bit of a borrower's market right now.","Let me take a couple of minutes to run through some growth statistics on different bank subsidiaries in our franchise. Zions Bank, which covers Utah and Idaho, grew loans held for investment by nearly $120 million, driven predominantly by C&I. Growth was partially offset by declines in commercial real estate and the continued planned decline in owner-occupied and CRE loans held in our National Real Estate Group.","Amegy Bank, which is predominantly a Houston-based bank, with some prevalence in Dallas and San Antonio, experienced growth of more than $80 million, up from approximately $30 million in the prior quarter. The growth came from commercial and consumer loans, and again, partially offset by continued declines in both categories of commercial real estate, that is construction and term.","National Bank of Arizona experienced pretty strong growth across the board, some commercial businesses to commercial real estate to residential mortgage. Vectra Bank, our Colorado subsidiary, also experienced solid loan growth across all 3 major loan types.","The 2 affiliates that experienced meaningful attrition in loan balances were California Bank & Trust, which saw an organic decline in commercial loans and loans supported by FDIC assistance. Declines were partially offset by organic growth in commercial real estate and a bit of consumer loan growth. And the other bank experiencing attrition was our Nevada State Bank subsidiary, and that market is, as many of you know, still very slow to emerge from the recession.","Harris referenced some of the loan growth rates by product type on Page 10 of the release, so I'll be brief in my comments on that. But I'll hit some of the highlights. C&I growth has been coming from a diverse group of industries. Energy remains a strong component, and we're seeing strengthening in manufacturing and consumer goods and services after long declines in both of those categories. The industries that are still detracting from C&I growth rate are construction-related businesses and some professional services firms. Net syndication and participation loans declined about $200 million compared to the prior quarter to about $1.5 billion in total.","As we've discussed in the past, the decline in owner-occupied loan portfolio is largely attributable to a decision made several quarters ago as a part of our concentration risk management efforts. That decision was to selectively reduce certain aspects of our exposure in our National Real Estate business.  Much of this is in the SBA 504 loan product. We expect additional attrition in this portfolio before it stabilizes, probably starting around the middle of next year, middle of 2013.","Construction development loans were down just over $140 million, which was somewhat unexpected. We've highlighted in the past few months that we've booked several hundred million dollars of new loan commitments for construction and development lending, which we expect will begin to fund over the next several months. However, payoffs this quarter were stronger than anticipated, resulting in a net decline in the portfolio. We still expect those new commitments to fund, but may be offset by higher attrition in the fourth quarter.","Within consumer lending, residential first mortgage loans grew at about 4% in the quarter, which is a rate that is comparable to the prior quarter. That growth was fairly widespread across the footprint.","Turning now to the net interest margin on Page 14, you'll notice that the GAAP NIM was stable. But the core NIM, which adjusts for items such as the sub -- modified sub debt conversion cost and the accretion on acquired loans, that core NIM actually declined about 12 basis points, and we give you that reconciliation between the GAAP and the core on Page 15 of the release.","Let me begin by addressing the yield in the securities portfolio, which declined to 3.4% -- from 3.8% last quarter. As we mentioned in the last quarter's call, the second quarter included some catch-up income. If normalized for that, the securities yield decline would have been about 25 basis points.","While we do not have a large MBS portfolio that's subject to refinancing risk, we do have securities where the underlying collateral consists of SBA and municipal loans, both of which are subject to rates resetting. For example, dealing with [ph] 2007, that had a fixed rate for the first 5 years, is resetting this year, that is, in 2012, at lower rates. Same phenomenon that we've talked about in our -- some of the parts of our loan portfolio. We expect that the securities portfolio yields will be under some additional modest pressure over the next few quarters.","Turning to loan yield. That declined 13 basis points to 4.94% from 5.07% last quarter again excluding FDIC-supported loans. This compression was attributable to the same factors that we've discussed in the past, which are adjustable rate loans resetting to lower rates, driven by a lower repricing index today compared to several years ago when the loans were booked and maturing loans that we'll replace with new loans at lower coupons and floors. Recall when these loans were last originated, most had rate floors at higher levels and\/or wider spreads with relative -- relevant benchmark index in the current market repricing.","A third factor is a continued mix shift towards lower-yielding residential mortgage loans held for investment, which warrants noting that while mortgages are incrementally dilutive to the NIM, the income from those mortgages is accretive to net interest income, basically converting 0 earning cash into mortgages.","As we highlighted back in January, 2012 is not going to be a particularly good year for NIM, and we noted that it would take a significant amount of loan growth to offset that effect. But we also said that as we enter 2013, the pressure should begin to subside to a more moderate level. Assuming a static balance sheet, we estimate that the NIM will be subject to ongoing pressure due to rate resets and new originations at current market levels, which are significantly lower than 3 to 5 years ago. However, because a fair amount of that resetting, refinancing volume is behind us, the pressure on the net interest income over the next 1 to 2 years should be lower than we've experienced over the last several quarters.","We're also mindful of a recent fairly sharp decline in LIBOR.  Roughly 10 basis points lower than the third quarter average is where it is today. If it stays there, that is likely to cause 2 to 4 basis points of NIM pressure in the fourth quarter.","Potential offsets to the NIM compression include loan growth, moderate -- modest reduction in the cost of interest-bearing deposits, or in the case of the fourth quarter of 2012, the decline in the average cash balance, which served as the source of the TARP redemption, which, itself, should lift the NIM by about 4 basis points, all else being equal. Finally, I again note that our balance sheet remains quite asset-sensitive.","Turning now to noninterest income. There are 2 items probably worth highlighting. First is that dividend in other investment income decreased compared to the prior quarter. Last quarter had some unusually large equity gains or gains in equity investments, primarily in Amegy, primarily attributable to the energy sector. Those gains were a bit more normal levels this quarter. It's also notable that gains from cash principal payments on our CDO portfolio exceeded the OTTI from that portfolio this quarter as principal paydowns and payoffs occurred on previously written-down securities. We expect such gains to continue, although they will likely be sporadic. I will note that in the fourth quarter, i.e., in the last couple of weeks, we have received cash principal paydowns from the BankAtlantic TruPS payoffs, which will result in a gain in the mid-single-digit millions on those securities.","On a related note, we saw an improvement in the AOCI mark by just over $40 million after tax, which was supported by improvement in the risk spreads on riskier assets, further decline in the number of banks deferring interest payments and a continued increase in the number of banks coming current on their payments. A total of 58 banks in our CDOs, that were previously deferring at one point have now come current and have stayed current on payments.  While we generally expect the value of the CDOs to improve over the long term, we caution that the path to improvement is likely to be somewhat volatile.","Turning now to credit. Let me summarize that virtually all the ratios that was in the release and others that we track, all improved significantly compared to the prior quarter. Not shown in the release, for example, are the NPA inflows, favorable resolutions versus unfavorable resolution rates and the loss severity rates, all of which compared meaningfully -- all of which improved meaningfully compared with the prior quarter.","Also, as you're aware right now, the loan regulator's [ph] chief accountant recently provided some interpretive guidance for banks whose consumer borrowers had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The guidance states that banks should charge down effective loans to their collateral values and reclassify them as troubled debt restructured loans, even if, as is the case in the many -- in a number of cases, even if the borrower is current with principal and interest payments and have not requested any modifications to loan terms. The company did not implement that guidance this quarter. We'll be trying to assure that we're doing this consistently for all 3 regulators who have to oversee us, but we have made some preliminary estimates. We estimate that only about $31 million of our loans' principal balance will be affected by this guidance if implemented. And we think, because of this limited amount, we expect that any charge-offs taken would be in the single-digit millions and should not affect the provision for loan losses. By single-digit millions, I mean not more than $7 million and probably rather less than that is our current estimate. No adjustments were made to the -- in the third quarter results pending completion of our analysis.","Finally, looking at capital GAAP tangible common equity ratio, improved to 7.2% from 6.9%, in part due to retained earnings but also the previously mentioned in accretion in the AOCI mark and a moderate decline in assets due to our TARP redemption. Estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio increased by 6 basis points from 9.84%.","Okay, some guidance for the future. As we potentially stare an election and fiscal cliff and other uncertainties in the face, I do this with a bit of trepidation, but we'll do the best we can. For loan growth, we see continued strength in our loan pipelines, had an increase in commitments in the last 6 months, and our customer's feeling a bit more optimistic. We do expect continued moderate loan growth over the next year or so. That loan growth does not, at this point, appear to be strengthening. But it seems to be holding fairly steady. Despite very expected loan growth, we're probably going to see a moderate amount of pressure on core net interest income, in part due to the new headwind of lower LIBOR rates as well as continued rate resets and the refinancing of older loans.","Noninterest income, we expect the less-volatile components of noninterest income, such as service fees, to continue a modest upward trend. While we don't have much income that comes from mortgage banking, we are experiencing a slightly elevated level of revenue from that source, which could subside when the current refi boom fades. However, it's such a small component of our income that it's not likely to move the needle on your models.","It's there in [ph] our CDO portfolio and OTTI, in general, that should remain low.  As fewer banks are failing, more are recovering, and our model is already quite conservative at predicting bank failures. Offsetting this trend may be faster bank prepayments of trust preferred securities, which has the effect of converting cash to the senior tranches that we own, potentially improving AOCI and fixed income gains there. But it removes excess spread from the mezzanine tranches, potentially resulting in additional OTTI. Net or on balance we expect these 2 effects to be accretive to tangible common equity over time.","For additional information on this phenomenon, you might want to again look at our recent investor relations slide decks for sensitivity analysis on this point.","Noninterest expense in the near term should continue to be relatively stable. We expect that provision expense to remain low, continued reduction in problem credits, the ongoing improvement in loss severity rates has the potential to result in negative provision. However, continued loan growth may offset that and keep the provision somewhere around zero or very low.","Regarding preferred stock dividends, as we've already guided, the preferred stock dividend in the fourth quarter should be approximately $23 million given effective [ph] full repayment of TARP in the third quarter.","With that, let's open up the line for questions, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question in the phone queue comes from Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question, Doyle, is on the trajectory of the core NIM going forward. Could you -- you mentioned that the spread compression this quarter was the same as last quarter, but could you remind us at where you're originating your current loans at today?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'll let James have a look. He's got some data, I'm going to -- on that. I'm going to let him look for it. It has been relatively stable, just a very slow downward drift over the last 6 or 7 quarters. So we're not seeing the average spread over mass maturity cost of funds compacting very much.","James R. Abbott","And Erika, it really does depend on the loan products and type for commercial business loans. We're looking at yields that are in the high 3% range. Small business loans are in the -- actually in high 4s, low 5s still. So it depends on the size and the product type and so forth. Commercial real estate is about -- oh, I'm sorry, residential and real estate is about 3.5% or so in that range. On -- throughout the overall mix for the company, we had about a 4% yield on a coupon basis, not including fee income, of new origin -- on absolute new originations, that's correct.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just my follow-up question is on the other side of the balance sheet. Could you give us a sense, and even if you -- the long-term debt cost is still relatively high, and clearly, we've been threatened with this lower-rate environment for longer.  Is there something you can do over the next 12 to 24 months in terms of calling this or taking this down? Because it's -- I mean, based on our conversations with our fixed-income folks, you could issue 5-year senior in the low 4%, which is significantly lower than what your long-term debt is costing you right now.","Doyle L. Arnold","We're keenly aware of that. And without making any promises, we've highlighted in a number of investor presentations that we have both capital and debt that was issued during the crisis, kind of in the period 2009 to 2010, that was very expensive. We did our best to, and I think successfully, either kept those maturities fairly short or built call options into them. We do have another large series of preferred stock Series C that becomes callable in September of next year. We have 8% trust preferred just on the $300 million of that that's callable at any time. And then we have both senior and subordinated debt maturing in 2014 and some in 2015 that's very expensive. It doesn't mature until then, but we could tender for it. It's not callable, but we get tender for it. The question there would be whether the premium that would have to be paid for a successful tender is worth the yield pickup. But I'd finally also note that the market, as you kind of indicated, seems to be pricing our debt and investment grade these days, even though one of the agencies still doesn't have us there, although they have indicated that they're going to review that rating here in the fairly near future. So I think things are still moving in the right direction for us to be able to address some of those things at lower cost. I just can't, particularly as we get ready to go in the CCAR exercise, give you much guidance on exactly when and in what order we'll begin to address those things. But we will. We do expect to address them.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","You mentioned in your guidance, Doyle, that you thought expenses would be flattish over the next few quarters. Is that sort of the result of ongoing credit-related expenses and those improving steadily, being sort of offset by just maybe more incentives as things get a little bit better? Can you kind of describe the dynamics that may be going on within the individual categories?","Doyle L. Arnold","I think you pretty well laid it out, almost. I mean, I -- basically, I do think that all the credit-related costs will continue to slowly decline. I mean, OREO is not likely to be 0 every quarter, unlike it was this quarter. But the general trend should continue to be down, but there probably will be some offset to that in salary kind of expenses. I think we've done a pretty good job of controlling salary and related expenses. But the general trend there should be very slowly upward, I would think. And the 2 -- I think the 2 roughly offsetting.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just want to ask about the excess cash balance position. Now that we're past TARP, you made the payback. Can you walk us through -- you still have about, depending on the period end versus the average balance, $7 billion to $8 billion of cash on the balance sheet earning 27, 25 basis points or so. How are you guys thinking through starting to use that and to redeploy that into loans? And what's the trigger for finally starting to kind of move that route?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, loan demand would be a good trigger. I mean, it's still not great. It's better than it was, but it's not great. And I don't think that -- I think dramatically cutting rates in some attempt to stimulate loan demand is likely just to cut rates, not achieve any broader objective. So -- and we still remain pretty cautious on deploying any significant amount of that cash into securities instruments with the duration extension risk of any meaningful amount.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So, Doyle, even though average loan balances were up $400 million or so this quarter, but cash was flat, so I'm kind of talking about just the -- even within what you've got already, it seems like you're letting deposit growth just kind of still accrue onto the balance sheet, so you haven't gotten a -- is there some cash that's trapped that you can't move away? Or is it just that your continued caution will just prevent any type of remixing on the balance sheet?","Doyle L. Arnold","As we look at where the cash is coming from, it's mostly coming from noninterest-bearing commercial DDA accounts. And we've tried to manage down the amount of and cost of just about everything else.","Harris H. Simmons","Almost $600 million this quarter, and that's...","Doyle L. Arnold","So, darn, our customers keep wanting to leave more money with us.  And we're basically paying nothing for that money except the FDIC costs.  And the earnings at the Fed roughly offset that. So it is a dilemma. I mean, the -- I think we can't figure out a whole lot more to do to keep deposits from continuing to flow in, particularly when it's commercial customers being conservative, sitting on cash and not deploying it, and they are growing their businesses in this uncertain environment. And that makes -- despite what we said about some businesses turning more optimistic and beginning to grow and borrow, there are still others that are generating a lot of cash and that are, for the time being, sitting on it and putting it on our balance sheet, which we, in turn, put on the Fed's balance sheet.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then my -- I'll just make my follow-up on the same topic. Is there a proportion of the balance sheet that you still have to keep in the securities book, because to your point about not wanting to extend in the securities portfolio, couldn't you continue to let that part of the book run down? Or are you already at a level where you need it for liquidity and pledging, et cetera?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, we don't -- I mean, cash is more liquid than securities. So I -- the -- David, do you want to comment on that at all?","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible] I mean, we don't have to have a certain level of securities. I mean, you can see here from the balance sheet that the securities are running down each quarter, that's through maturities or through prepayments. And we've done very little purchasing, because the benefit -- I mean, you all know that a 2-year treasury yields less than 25 basis points, I mean -- which is what the Fed is paying us on our Fed [indiscernible]. There are hardly no interest rate risks. It's a problem we talk about and think about every day, but we're submitted to not getting ourselves caught when the interest rates double, but we're living in [indiscernible].","Harris H. Simmons","I think it's also fair to say -- I mean, roughly half of our securities today are also not really a source of liquidity. I mean, the CDOs are -- we absolutely think their money's good in terms of how we have them recurring [ph] values we have on our financial statements. But they're not a source of liquidity in the sense that you can go out and find a buyer immediately. So holding a little more cash in lieu of that is, I think, prudent.","Doyle L. Arnold","Back on Page 4 of the release, you'll notice just over $2 billion of amortized cost of our securities is in that CDO portfolio. And as Harris said, that remains -- while it's improved a bit, it's -- basically, I would characterize it as still highly illiquid.","Operator","Next phone question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick follow-ups. First, I guess, on Erika's question on capital plan and thinking about going into CCAR 2013, is the focus likely to be just on redeeming this higher-cost TruPS and refinancing the Series C? Or is there any chance we might see a dividend increase as well?","Doyle L. Arnold","They -- the -- I mean, we're -- I guess we are mindful that our shareholders, common shareholders, have been long-suffering. And as the trajectory of earnings continues to improve, I think we do at some point want to deliver modest increases to the dividend. But we do have -- I think our equally high, or if not higher, priority is to increase earnings to common that would be dividend-able in the future by reducing these financing and capital costs. We have a lot of capital and -- capital markets and debt markets actions to do over the next 2 years or so, all with the objection -- objective of cleaning up the capital structure and reducing its costs and the debt structure.","James R. Abbott","I'd also just add -- I mean, I -- if we did anything, I think it's likely to be modest. And especially, well, depending on the outcome of, not just the presidential elections but the elections generally and what's likely to happen with the taxation of dividends beginning of the year, because you could see, effectively, a trebling of the tax on dividend, that income. And that would probably play into our board's thinking about it.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That certainly makes sense. So I guess the other question was can -- do you have any updated thoughts about potential deposit outflows related to the TAG guarantee going away at the end of the year? Anything about that?","Doyle L. Arnold","What we're not seeing or hearing is a great hue and cry among our commercial customers about that topic. So I guess our thinking is beginning to drift in the direction of, particularly depending on what a couple of rating agencies do, that the expiry of the TAG Program may not be a particularly big event.","Harris H. Simmons","Hard to think that it won't have some impact, but I -- but so far, we're not getting a lot of feedback through the grapevine that that's something that's much talked about.","Operator","Next phone question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Now you talked -- you gave some pretty good color about the different regions and what's doing better, what's not. And I think there's a lot of commentary about both Phoenix and Vegas doing much better in homebuilding. But you kind of listed them as the regions doing the weakest of the 5 that you're in. Can you just add a little more color on that?  Because there's been a lot of good commentary media reports about Vegas and Arizona.","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I said Arizona was actually pretty strong across the board for us. But you are correct, for us, this quarter, Southern Nevada still remains pretty flat in terms of aggregate -- or the net change in their loan portfolio. I don't -- Harris, do you have any recent color on that?","Harris H. Simmons","No. I think across the board in Arizona, we're seeing improvement in growth. But the Las Vegas market is decidedly slower.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Is the Vegas market slower?  And then -- and the other issue, you said that, and you talked about how the energy loans and a lot of your loan demand that you're seeing is well diversified. Are you bidding a lot of housing-related loans? Are they starting to come through or is that -- they're still being muted?","Doyle L. Arnold","On the residential side, we are seeing some growth there.  Is that's what you mean, Paul?","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","No, I mean the homebuilders. I'm talking about the overall derivative effect of a recovering housing market in those areas. Are you starting to see -- when you guys were picking homebuilding in Vegas, I believe, on the derivatives, are you saying -- are you being -- I'm just wondering how much of this loan demand is related to some of the recoveries of those markets.","Doyle L. Arnold","I would maybe chime in here. We did see a little bit of -- on the C&I side, businesses would have a construction bent to them.  We did see a slight increase in the third month of the quarter. So it's hard to say that 1 month is a trend. It's still down, it's still generally pulling our loan balances down off businesses that have construction-related activities.","Operator","Our next questioner comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on NIM here. It's -- I know you guys have been pretty clear in the past about -- I think it was roughly 4 basis points of loan compression from the floors that are resetting, and I know there's a couple other things in the quarter that would have driven it down sequentially. Where are you surprised, in terms of NIM discourse? Let me go out on a limb here and say that the NIM compression was a lot worse than what we were expecting, and I'm trying to figure out what was different such that we either may or may not build in another, say, 12 basis points of compression next quarter, if that makes sense?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I think we pointed out -- we've given you 2 sources that would be ongoing pressures that added up to kind of 8 to 10. And yes, it was a little bit more than that. I mean, the additional cash balances that were there for most of the quarter, that probably accounts for -- on NIM itself...","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","1 to 2.","Doyle L. Arnold","Another 1 to 2, so you get close to the total. I don't think there's any other single thing that was a particular driver. And then in terms of net interest income, what we've been saying is that we needed net $400 million to $500 million loan growth on average to sort of offset the known pressures. And we kind of got around the bottom end of that and then almost kept core noninterest income stable. So I don't think we're too far off in our guidance. I mean, I -- when you get down to 1 or 2 basis points, it's kind of hard for us to get it that precise, I'm sorry.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. No, that's fine. Just another question I had, in terms of the CDO portfolio, given some of you expect additional gains, and then I guess I'm thinking like the BankAtlantic in fourth quarter, but also from higher prepayments, you'd have more OTTI. When you think about the net number here -- I mean, is it such that the additional cash principal payment gains might offset the OTTI on a net basis? Or is it just too volatile in Q2 [indiscernible]?","Doyle L. Arnold","All we said is the effect on income in any given quarter may be either positive or negative from that. They probably won't predictably offset each other in any one direction every quarter. But what we have said is that the net effect on tangible common equity of all this should be positive from those effects, because while you have those 2 somewhat countervailing effects on the income statement, the same phenomenon should be increasing the -- or improving the AOCI mark, as it did this quarter.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know one of the reasons you haven't shown stronger loan growth over the past few quarters has been an unwillingness to match price competition, particularly in markets like California. Are you now being more competitive with price? Is this what's driving loan growth to improve a bit here?","Harris H. Simmons","We're trying not to let good customers go over a modest price difference and -- but also trying not to be the price leader on the way down as well. It's a fine balancing act. But yes, maybe we're, at the margin, more determined to keep good customers and not let them get away. But -- and so that probably has some impact on this. But again, as I say, the net effect of all of that on average spreads over mass maturity cost of funds month-to-month has not been very dramatic. It's been very, very incremental.","Doyle L. Arnold","There's a slide in our last investor presentation, I think, it shows that -- just to match maturity spreads on new production, it's fairly illustrative. And it's pretty flat.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, maybe just to follow up on that earlier comments, you indicated that customers appear more optimistic. It's very different from what we're hearing from some other banks that are less bullish on the loan growth outlook, citing commercial customers pulling back here a bit, given the fiscal cliff. Are you seeing a change in customer behavior across the different banks related to this?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I think the comments were a bit more specific to small business customers. And yes, I mean, when we started putting the script together, I really challenged James on that comment in particular. And -- but he's getting it from a fairly widespread sample of our loan officers with regard to small business. I don't think it applies necessarily to the upper middle market and commercial. So I -- maybe that helps.","James R. Abbott","Yes, I would just add that the small business lenders as we talked to them around the company have -- when you ask them the question, are things better today than they were 3 months ago, which is different from the question, are things better today than they were 4 years ago, but, no, their comments are fairly consistently unanimous that things seem to be better for the small business customer. They're probably a little bit more bankable today from a balance sheet and earnings perspective, and they are becoming a little bit more optimistic, at least the ones that we're dealing with.","Operator","Next questioner in queue comes from John Pancari with Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the magnitude of the margin compression you expect? I know you indicated you expect some continued pressure, but I'm more specifically wanting to see how you can kind of talk about the benefit of the excess liquidity you have. And as loan growth improves, I have to assume that, that provides Zions with a bit more resiliency to the margin than a lot of the other banks that may not have that benefit of the liquidity sitting on the balance sheet.","Doyle L. Arnold","We would agree wholeheartedly with that statement. We -- that's part of the being asset-sensitive that -- what we -- if and when the Fed does start to raise rates, I mean, we would expect a couple of things. We would expect deposit rates to [indiscernible] loan repricing in that environment, and we would expect some outflow of that excess liquidity as companies begin to -- the Fed would only be doing that in an environment where economic activity is picking up. And so we would expect a lot of those commercial DDA deposits to begin to flow back out.  But we think there's so much of it that we could fund a lot of loan growth without substantial increases in deposit rates, at least, in the early staging of [indiscernible]. By the same token, the fact that we haven't put our mortgage-backed securities or other securities with duration extension risk means that as rates rise, we're not going to have a large pile of what would then become underwater securities that we would be selling at a loss if we needed to generate liquidity. So that's basically the game plan. If the Fed succeeds at keeping rates very low for longer, then it's going to take a while for that to play out. If we see a quicker return over the next year or 2 to economic -- more substantial economic growth, let's say, we -- I think we're very well positioned for that environment.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess, also what I was getting at is, barring any move in short-term rates to the upside, just the -- I guess, I wanted to see how you thought about the asset mix shift, just funding loan growth the excess liquidity [indiscernible] earning asset mix shift could provide some stability there.","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, yes. I mean, we have -- we're earning 25 basis points on that cash. And on -- every loan we put on earns us 400 basis points, plus or minus. So the pickup is 3 75 for every dollar of cash that converts to a loan. That's the basic math. Maybe you're asking that more subtle question than I'm getting. I'll give you one more try.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","No, no, that's essentially it.  I guess I was just looking for if you could put that into context of the margin compression that you expect through 2013.","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, yeah, I mean that's -- what we've said is that if can get $400 million to $500 million of average loan growth at kind of current rates consistently, that offsets the margin compression and keeps net interest income stable.","James R. Abbott","And I would add -- maybe I would add, too, that it's a little bit harder to predict sometimes on margin because, for example, back in January when we first gave guidance about the margin compression in the 4, 5 \"basis point per quarter\" range, we didn't incorporate in that view a decline in -- a sharp decline in LIBOR rates. So there are a lot of factors at work, sharp decline in residential mortgage pricing as well. So those are some of the considerations that could cause additional pressure. But back at that point in time, we estimated that as you went into 2013, it was 2, maybe, or so basis points per quarter of margin compression throughout 2013. And recent analysis is not suggesting something significantly different than that. And that's, again, on a static balance sheet.  It assumes no growth. So...","Doyle L. Arnold","By the way, this LIBOR decline down to about 30 basis points or so, that's about as -- that's getting close to its low as it's been in over the last 5 years, going back even pre-crisis. So -- and it's short-term LIBOR, so that repricing effect is not one that continues for a long, long time per se. It's probably worked its way through fairly quickly.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And then there's a different topic. As for now, I'll ask about the loan loss reserve at 253 bps of loans here. I just want to get your thoughts on, long term, where that could normalize out at.","Harris H. Simmons","I'll -- I'm going to continue to refer to the regulators, the FASB and the SEC, on that question. I'm aware they're having lots and lots of discussions, and the regulators apparently expressing the point of view that companies should have -- maybe have not been cautious enough about releasing reserves aggressively and that, that can't continue.  And -- we don't think they were particularly talking about us when they made those comments. And so we're -- I think we'll continue to just be cautious and follow the trends.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue comes from Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just given the slightly more optimistic tone on loan growth, I'm just trying to separate how much is really demand-driven from better environmental kind of drivers versus how much is driven by you guys feeling much more comfortable now that TARP is behind you, and you can deploy a lot of this excess liquidity. So just kind of curious maybe how much of this more optimistic tone is demand-driven rather than maybe supply-driven.","Doyle L. Arnold","None of it's really supply-driven. It's demand-driven. TARP -- having TARP -- having repaid TARP had, I don't think, any impact either way on our willingness to lend. We've for quite some time now been turning over rocks, looking for credit-worthy borrowers who wanted to grow and borrow, and that has not changed. What's changed is a little bit more willingness on the part of the few more borrowers to do so.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Good. No, that's good to hear. And then I was just curious, in that vein, I think you said -- mentioned that total loan commitments were up like $400 million last quarter. Just kind of curious what that might be in the third quarter.","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm going turn to James, because I don't know.","James R. Abbott","My [ph] commitments were up a couple hundred million dollars this quarter.  Over the last, I think -- year-to-date, I think it's up $1.5 billion. So it's up fairly substantially. Some of the biggest commitment increases came in the prior quarter and the quarter before that. They were in part related to construction loans which, again, we mentioned that we think that will cause some loan growth in that category in the future.","Operator","Our next questioner in queue comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just real quick, I think the -- what's interesting is you guys have a bunch of levers, right? So the excess liquidity is out there that, really it's demand that from customers that can help deploy that. On the capital side and debt side, it's kind of more at your control. I guess what I'm wondering is when you think about your senior debt and the sub debt, the trust preferreds, do you have to wait to CCAR in order to think about tendering for those?  Or is that something you think you could do before the CCAR process takes place?","Doyle L. Arnold","It's a question -- that's a question we're asking ourselves, Brian, and I don't know the answer. It's a [indiscernible]. I mean, it's a good question. I think it's unequivocally true that actions that on net would reduce capital, particularly core Tier 1 kinds of capital, so it would reduce parent liquidity significantly with the -- probably not entertain-able except in the context of the CCAR process upcoming. Whether you could do some things that were -- like we did with earlier this year, with exchanging one piece of preferred for another piece of preferred that were substantially similar, except for a lower cost. Whether you could do some of that is an open question and one that is of interest.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then maybe just a follow-up on that, can you update us on liquidity that's at the parent company now and then what kind of dividend capacity you can upstream from the subs?","Doyle L. Arnold","I think the parent has very ample liquidity. I know it's well -- it's in excess of $0.5 billion with the parent kind of where it's been and where we're targeting it. And all the banks are profitable, and most are upstreaming dividends and some -- there's probably still some but smaller than our recent quarter's repatriation of capital from some of the subs still yet to come. So I don't think cash at the parent, per se, is constrained on the common dividend. It's one of the other things we talked about earlier in response to a question.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So it sounds like you've got the ability to access that cash. It's just the matter of working it -- working through the whole CCAR, the regulators.","James R. Abbott","Right. Cash at the parent is almost $600 million. Actually, it's about $580 million at the end of the third quarter.","Doyle L. Arnold","And as we -- the net parent cash needs now both for TARP repayment and for TARP dividends are -- they've declined substantially and, as we address some of these other higher-cost things, will continue to decline. So we're feeling pretty good about the parent cash.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our times for question. I'd like to turn the program back over to Mr. Abbott for any additional or closing remarks.","James R. Abbott","So again, thank you very much for joining us this afternoon.

At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode but later there will be a chance to ask questions and instructions will be given at that time (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And now I would like to turn it over to your host James Abbott. ","James R. Abbott ","Good evening, and thanks, John. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2014 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. (Operator Instructions). ","With that I will now turn it over to Harris.","Harris H. Simmons ","Thanks very much, James, and welcome all of you who are on the call today. I would start by saying that we are generally pleased with most of the facets of the quarterly results. And especially pleased with the significant reduction in our CDO exposure which has been a long time coming. It represents a significant improvement to the risk profile of the company. ","However, our comprehensive capital analysis and review or CCAR results have been probably much more impactful to our recent stock price than the actual fundamental results we're announcing today will be -- I'll address that briefly recognizing the communications with the regulators is required to be kept confidential. ","But what I can say is that as we announced on March 20, under the results published by the Federal Reserve under the hypothetical severely adverse economic stress scenario in the Dodd Frank Act stress test to the DFAST test run by the -- as it was run by the Federal Reserve, Zions' capital ratios would not have met the minimum requirements under the Federal Reserve's capital adequacy rules. ","The credit loss rates that were rejected by the Federal Reserve's model for Zions were broadly similar to the loss rates projected for other CCAR banks, even if they were much higher than the loss rates that we projected. However, the Federal Reserve's models projected much lower pretax pre-provision net revenue than for other banks relative to the run-rates immediately prior to the beginning of the stress test period. And those rates were much lower than Zions' experienced in 2008 through 2010 recession. ","Our own models produced significantly different results from those of the Federal Reserve. We remain quite confident that under an actual severely adverse economic environment and with no access to the capital markets Zions would remain comfortably above the threshold of 5% Tier 1 common equity as a percentage of risk weighted assets. Even before the Federal Reserve publication of its DFAST stress test results Zions had informed the Federal Reserve that it intended to resubmit its capital plan. This resubmission will incorporate the effects of the nearly $1 billion in par value of CDO sales accomplished during the first quarter and of the Interim Final Volcker rule published after Zions CCAR submission.","The Interim Final Volcker rule removed the requirement that Zions divest its primarily bank trust preferred CDOs. The CDOs sold were selected because they either had the most risk of impairment under a severely adverse scenario, the highest risk weights or were prohibited by the Volcker rule even after modification by the Interim Final rule. By about the end of this month we expect to have submitted that revised capital plan which will project significantly better stress tests -- better stressed capital ratios due to the CDO sales in the Interim Final Volcker rule. However, we will not comment on any further capital actions until the resubmission and review process is complete. ","Just summarizing, our net interest income on loans situation, we return to the financial results for the quarter; Net interest income was largely unchanged compared to the year-ago period. Although flat revenue certainly is not our goal, given the persistently low interest rate environment and the pressure that places on our net interest margin and the significantly declining contribution from the FDIC indemnified loans we're encouraged with the roll out of stability. ","We experienced strong average loan growth in the first quarter which is mostly attributable to strong fourth quarter period end growth. Although, we are pleased with the strong fourth quarter growth, didn't reverse itself as it has frequently done in previous first quarter periods. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged which is to say we expect to see slight to moderately increasing loan volumes as we go through 2014. ","Credit quality is strong and the trends are stable. Our loan net charge-off ratio remains one of the best in the industry at eight basis points of total loans on an annualized basis. Non-performing assets improved slightly while our classified loans increased slightly, both we think are fluctuations within what we would call statistical noise ranges. We think that quality is actually pretty stable and at a pretty good place right now. ","Speaking to capital, our GAAP common equity capital ratios increased compared to the prior quarter with the tangible common equity ratio rising to 8.2% from 8.0% last quarter. The Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I improved to 10.5% from 10.2% and we estimate our Basel III common equity Tier I ratio to be approximately 10.3%. ","We announced in today's press release that we canceled the total return swap effective April 28 which will result in an increase in the risk weightings on some of our CDO securities in the second quarter. If the total return swap had been canceled at March 31 risk weighted assets would have been approximately $1.1 billion higher and the Basel I Tier 1 common ratio would have been approximately 10.25%. The benefit of canceling the total return swap will increase pre-provision net revenue by approximately $22 million annually. ","With that general overview I'll turn the time over to Doyle Arnold and ask him to review the quarterly financial performance in little more detail. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon and good evening everyone. For the first quarter of 2014, as noted in the press release we posted net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $76.2 million or $0.41 per diluted common share. That compares to a net loss of $59.4 million or $0.32 per diluted common share in the fourth quarter. I'm sure you'll recall that the fourth quarter results included two particularly significant items, namely the impairment of a portion of the CDO securities related to the Volcker rule as it then applied and the debt extinguishment charge which reduced earnings by $0.74 a share. ","Those items did not reoccur in the first quarter. However in the first quarter we did recognize a $31 million pretax gain on fixed income securities or about $0.10 a share, as discussed in the release and I will touch on again later that related to the substantial de-risking of the CDO portfolio sales that Harris mentioned. ","Zion\u2019s net interest income was in line with consensus expectations. Non-interest income and expense variances largely offset each other. The primary variants between the consensus estimate of $0.42 a share and the GAAP EPS of -- that we reported of $0.41, less the $0.10 gain on securities sold would appear to involve two main factors. A smaller amount of reserve released this quarter and a higher preferred stock dividend than we had perhaps led you to expect, I will touch on that in a minute. The relatively small reserve released does not reflect any change in our outlook about credit quality and barring some unforeseen change we currently anticipate somewhat larger reserve releases in the next couple of quarters. ","The higher preferred stock dividend is attributed to the issuance in 2013 of two series of preferred stock on which the dividend payments are semiannual instead of quarterly. Ordinary the semiannual dividends alternate quarters and the amounts are similar and thus going forward they should be relatively neutral to ongoing EPS calculations but the first declaration on one particular issue, which effectively involved two quarters of dividends did create some noise which was about $0.05 per share more relative to expectations. ","Now I\u2019ll move onto some of the key revenue drivers, turning to page 14, the table in the press, release average loans held for investment increased $545 million compared to the prior quarter and ending loan balances increased $220 million. We are so far in April experiencing an improved growth rate although it\u2019s early in the quarter, we expect it to continue, based on reports from our various lending groups. ","Zion\u2019s loan growth is being constrained in some cases by self-imposed concentration limits, particularly on some types of real estate loans at some markets and if the company did not have such limits loan growth rates would be even stronger. In part because of concentration limits we are able to be more selective on the deals we do accept, slower to cut pricing or loosen underwriting standards for example. We are encouraged by recent reports that the outlook for capital expenditure spending for both large and small businesses is on the rise and we are optimistic that small businesses in some markets are becoming more active borrowers. ","Smaller C&I loans defined by us as commitments less than $5 million accounted for 56% of the quarterly C&I production in the first quarter, which was up from 49% in the year-ago period. Smaller C&I production volume increased 13% relative to the year ago period while larger production volume declined 17%. As some of you may recall we kind of keep loosely tracking -- we loosely track these kinds of statistics because the pricing on the smaller loans is generally a bit better than on the larger loans. ","Moving on to new loan production we are encouraged that loan pricing on new production does overall remain essentially stable compared to the prior quarter. Nonetheless the yield on the loan portfolio excluding the FDIC supported loans declined 11 basis points to 4.30% from 4.41% in the prior quarter. Most of the compression was the result of the coupon on new production equaling less than that of the portfolio as a whole. ","We are likely to experience additional compression for the next several quarters. For the same reason although the portfolio yield -- as the portfolio yield converges with the production yield that compression should become less than that experienced in the first quarter. ","Line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans were relatively stable at 32%. Unfunded commitment growth increased more than $300 million or about an 8% annualized rate which also bodes well for future balanced growth. Within the unfunded commitment growth commercial real estate commitments declined while C&I and consumer expanded. ","Let me discuss the FDIC-supported loans and the income from that source, as I've done in the past, that they will come in a few more quarters when we won't talk about this anymore because we're nearing the end of that rather happy experience that we had over the last five years. We continue to experience quite strong performance of the loans in this portfolio, although on a steadily declining balance. ","Pay-off values are well in excess of the prices to which we have marked the loans and pre-payments continue to remain above expectations, which generates accelerated income and enhances the yield of the FDIC-supported loans, which was an annualized 29% for the first quarter or $23 million of total interest income. That's about 6% of total net interest income yet the loans represent just 0.6% of total interest earning assets. ","Just three months ago we had expected the total remaining income from this portfolio to be roughly $80 million, the substantial majority of which would be recognized by the end of 2015. The updated numbers now are more than $87 million of which about $23 million was recognized in the first quarter and it's -- as I said it's certainly encouraging the CD additional income but we know that eventually it will decline and that decline could be rapid. The indemnification asset related to this loan book, which is recognized as a sub component of other non-interest expense should amount to a total of about $10 million and be exhausted between now and the end of this year. Most of that will happen in the second quarter. ","Turning now to margin, net interest income, page 14 of the release you will note that the NIM declined two basis points compared to the prior quarter. The change in the mix of the asset base, higher average balance of loans and the reduced balance of cash contributed to the stability and the reported NIM as well as the decline in the cost of long-term debt. As you know we've been retiring through tender or maturities the more expensive debt that was issued in the 2009-2010 timeframe. ","On page nine total net interest income was $416 million, down from $432 in the prior quarter. Although we have ceased providing a core \"net interest income number\" we did commit to give you the components so that you could calculate it if you wish. The additional accretion is found on the table at the bottom of the page 10 equaling $18.5 million and the discount amortization on subordinated debt was $8 million. Adjusting for these factors there was about $9 million linked-quarter decrease in net interest income, which is essentially entirely related to the difference in day count, two fewer days at about $4.5 million per day. The margin, if you adjust for those same factors actually increased slightly. ","Turning now to non-interest income, also on page nine, after adjusting for the noise, positive noise of the securities gains, we experienced some further pressure on some of the core items although these items also are affected by seasonal factors related to softer volume in the first quarter of this year. This would apply for example to other service charges, commissions and fees. ","The dividends and other investment income line was adversely impacted by a lack of income from several private equity investments, primarily at Amegy. While this quarter was unusual in that area and some income may be recognized in the near future, as we liquidate the fund investments prohibited by the Volcker rule in the medium term that revenue source should decline to roughly the first quarter level. ","The fair value non-hedged derivative line included a contra revenue item primarily related to the total return swap, which as we noted -- Harris noted we have canceled effective next week. So this amount will fall to about a $0.5 million in the second quarter and will be zero thereafter. ","Turning to non-interest expense, again on page nine, salaries and benefits increased by $6.8 million. Most of that is seasonal, about $5 million for payroll taxes, $2 million for medical insurance. Legal and professional services expense declined significantly to $11 million from $24 million with most of the difference coming from consulting costs related to the CCAR process. We do expect to incur an increase in those consulting kinds of expenses in the second quarter and in the second half as we further upgrade our stress testing processes. ","We also experienced some relief on the legal expense front by about $3 million, although that line can be volatile depending on the timing of what's going on in specific cases. The decline in other non-interest expense is largely attributable to the decline in the FDIC indemnification asset amortization pricing at three times quickly and regulatory related expenses.","So summing up now with a little bit of a outlook commentary. The outlook again is kind of what would we expect in general over the next four quarters or so relative to the most recent quarter. For loan growth we're maintaining our slight to moderate growth outlook for loans over the one year horizon. And as I've mentioned loans have continued to grow thus far in April with strong performance in C&I and residential mortgage, partially offset by a net decline in commercial real estate. So we're reasonably comfortable with that guidance. ","Net interest income on a GAAP basis, including the effect of an expected decline in interest income from FDIC-supported loans we would expect to remain relatively stable. Pressure should come from further declines in the FDIC-supported loan interest income and loans maturing that are replaced with loans at lower yields. As we get further out in 2014 and early '15 we expect that loan growth and higher cost senior and subordinated debt payoffs will offset much of the pressure. ","Furthermore as we remain rather asset sensitive we're in a position to modify the duration of equity, lengthen it a bit, which would generate a small amount of incremental net interest income and we've been very selectively doing a little of that through both asset and liability swaps in recent months.","Excluding FDIC-supported loan income we actually would expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next year but again that's excluding the drag from the FDIC income kind of winding down. On the non-interest income lines we expect the less volatile components of non-interest income such as service fees to continue at a modest upward trend as we press our mortgage initiatives and enhance treasury management product penetration. ","On non-interest expense we would expect that to remain relatively stable at around $1.6 billion, annually with increases coming related to the core systems replacement project, continued CCAR-related expenses and somewhat offset by continued reduction in credit related and deposit insurance expenses.","Provision expense we expect it to remain negative for another couple of quarters and again as I mentioned earlier probably somewhat more so in the first quarter, our net loan loss rates have been among the best of the regional banks and declining and some of the global economic concerns that have led us maintain a higher reserve seems to be fading into the past which makes it increasingly difficult to support having one of the proportionally largest reserves in the industry. ","Preferred stock dividends should run in the $15 million to $16 million per quarter into the foreseeable future after the one time catch-up accrual in the first quarter. ","With that I think that\u2019s enough of an opening soliloquy from me and Harris and we will allow John to moderate or queue up your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our first question from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Ken please go ahead.","Harris H. Simmons ","Hey, Ken. Ken?","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ","Sorry. I was on mute. ","Harris H. Simmons ","Okay.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ","Quick question for you, in terms of, Doyle you mentioned that you're lessening the duration of your equity, but you mentioned swaps, can you just address a little bit more like how do you guys think about investing the cash, just an outright move from fed funds into say MBS versus swaps and why not do that versus the swaps?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, as you could do -- you can actually do neither, either or both. We are mindful of the LCR ratio and we have far less than the total amount of cash is truly free. I mean we could deploy it into treasury securities without penalty but if you deploy it even in the mortgage bag share I think incurring some penalty on the LCR, not to mention the interest rate risk negatives can actually associated with that. So you know we actually have to -- we and all banks we are going to have to remain much more liquid than we have in the past and we have chosen to keep a lot of it in very short term cash. ","The swaps are -- I mean it\u2019s pretty straight forward. You could do interest rate swaps on loans, take floating rate prime or LIBOR-based and swap for received fixed contracts. We have done a little bit of that or even to do the opposite, make the opposite trade on your own debt and we have done, are in process doing a little bit of that. Again we don't want to give up the entire asset sensitive position, certainly not in this interest rate environment and we certainly don't want to lock away a lot of cash and very long duration assets with negative convexity risk. So that\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it. Anybody of my colleagues want to come? Okay, I am getting all good on our end. How about your end, Ken?","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ","Yeah, I think I was good on the swaps right now. Just as a follow-up, the fee line you mentioned that it was going to increase modestly but I guess this quarter it sort of declined a fair bit more than what we are looking forward. When you talk about a modest increase in fees is that adjusting for seasonality or should we assume a step-up in fees next quarter and then increase modestly or is it really increasing off of this lower base at a slow pace. Thanks. ","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, it\u2019s a hard one there. I think it\u2019s fair to say we were a little surprised that, I don't know if weaknesses is the right word but just the fact that fee income was just a little soft to our normal lines, that\u2019s not our real expectation. Going forward as we have talked about we are putting a whole lot of effort in to growing wealth management, mortgage lending, treasury management and some other things like that. So we are a bit surprised that it didn't show up a little more here. I would hope that -- I think our hope is that this is not a new base from which we have to claw back with a little bit of softness. Of course you know the big line -- the fair value non-hedged derivative line, that\u2019s the swap, the TRS is a big driver of that line. So that negative line will be a whole lot smaller next quarter. ","Anybody you want to comment any further on that, Okay.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, so sounds like your data, your fee line shouldn't be that materially different from the industry because I think there has been a pretty big trend of everyone fees being a lot weaker and everyone expecting higher fees in second quarter, it sounds like you are pretty much in line with the rest of the banks in that regard, aside from the TRS of course.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yeah, I will take your word for it because I just haven't had time to study the others and I know you've been absorbed with them, so I'll take a word for you. ","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley ","All right. Fair enough, thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you, sir. And we'll take our next question from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP.","Harris H. Simmons ","Hello, Brad. Brad? Might be on mute. ","Operator","If you could just check your mute button, your line is open. ","Harris H. Simmons ","Why don't we take somebody else and go back to Brad. ","Operator","Yeah, we'll go with the next question from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. ","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Thanks, guys. May be just to hit on CRE first, you guys put a pretty decent construction loan growth, can you give us any detail on what type of loans you are adding and also what type of loans you are running off, whether they are going to life insurance industry or CNBS Conduits? ","Harris H. Simmons ","We're going to let Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer field that one for you, Craig. ","Michael Morris","Thanks. Most of the CRE balance growth has come from construction loans put on through the cycle. We're not seeing the kind of commitment increases in CRE that we've seen in balances and those are just loan balances that are catching up, a lot of that was multi-family. We feel good about our multi-family exposure and so the CRE balance growth that you've seen are mostly, I would say 2012-2013 vintage. They are now starting to ripen, starting to stabilize and will be moving to term. ","With respect to the take out markets, it is competitive. We do see term loans roll off, some of which we would prefer would stay but it's very competitive on the rate side and we are, as you probably know a recourse lender and most of the life companies and CNBS lenders and Conduits offer non-recourse loans. And then are the GSEs and the agencies, they are doing most of the multi-family and that's very tough to compete with. ","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Thanks, and just a follow up. Can you give us what the actual yield was on loans you added in the first quarter and also give us a range for the loan to value ratios? ","Harris H. Simmons ","Craig, are you referring to commercial real estate? ","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","So aggregate commercial real estate, which includes construction. ","Harris H. Simmons ","So I've got -- Craig I can give it to you on -- I've got it broken down by commercial term and then construction but on term it was an overall yield of about 370. ","Doyle L. Arnold","And that was on new loan. ","Harris H. Simmons ","On new in production, on term commercial real estate. And on construction the yield on -- in production for the quarter was about 350.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","And any color on LTVs? ","Doyle L. Arnold","Weighted average LTV of the existing portfolio, which would include construction is going to be somewhere in the 60s somewhere in the mid-60s. We are seeing may be a little bit on the new loan growth, little higher advance rate, perhaps pushing 70. ","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","All right, great guys. Thanks for taking my questions. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies LLC. Ken, please go ahead. ","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Harris, just to follow on your points, understanding that your conversations with the regulators about CCAR are confidential but just from a process perspective, just wondering as you think about what you guys are going to have to do in your re-submission do you have an understanding of when you'll be able to resubmit, what quarter or quarters of earnings you will be able to count from the original submission date and just how you are just kind of thinking of the process and how it might be different from the original submission?","Harris H. Simmons ","I think I could say that it's kind of start of the -- core stress period is January 1st. And so it captures everything that took place during the fourth quarter as well as I said earlier we expect some impact of all of the security sales that took place during the first quarter as well as the impact of the interim final rule on the Volcker rule that was republished in mid-January. So those are basically elements -- we're at work on preparing the resubmission and so we have the scenario and\u2026","Doyle L. Arnold","It does involve a new scenario provided by the fed as-well-as new ones -- this is Doyle -- created by us. And we will -- I think our submission will be in the next few weeks, possibly next week but the federal reserve then has under its rule 75 days to say we object or we do not object to what was proposed in the new plan. And so you may not get -- you and we may not find out exactly what we're going to do here until early in the third quarter. Could come -- if they speed up their process it could come, we might have an answer sometime in the latter part of the second quarter. ","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC","Okay, and then just given that we haven't had a public forum for you guys since that time, the $400 million -- that you mentioned in your press release that was part of your original submission, does that have any bearing or necessarily inclusion in what you end up resubmitting as far as potential capital actions that you might take to comply in your resubmission?","Harris H. Simmons ","I'd say it's a resubmission, so it's really a new submission with new capital actions et cetera. So we're still sorting through that. But it doesn't -- the 400 is not necessarily binding on us. It's not a starting point from which to start the new one. ","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC","Right. So I guess the question that lot of people are just asking is how do we start to understand the various mechanisms by which you might be thinking through in terms of either combo or some balance of factors to close that gap between 3%, 6% and 5%?","Harris H. Simmons ","Well. The -- if you take the original submission the 3%, 6% without the capital raise that's -- you can calculate how much that was, we had $400 million in the original and you can calculate the size of the whole. What we're not going to tell you is what we think the whole might be that we need to fill a [FINI] and the resubmission that's going to be between us and the fed until it's done. What we've told you is that one big contributing factor several hundred million so the whole would probably projected losses on the CDO portfolio and we believe that we have substantially eliminated that part of it by selling over $900 million of those securities that were calculated I believed by us to have the highest risk of stress losses in these scenarios. ","But it's a new calculation, a new scenario, we will tell you the answer when we know the answer I guess and I know that's probably an unsatisfying, it's been unsatisfying to us but that's just the process. ","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company LLC","Okay, understood. Thanks guys. ","Harris H. Simmons ","Thanks. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank. Dave, please go ahead.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Good afternoon guys. ","Harris H. Simmons ","Hello, Dave.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Sorry if you already mentioned this but I was just wondering have you guys considered filing for an extension for your resubmission, is that something that you can pursue?","Doyle L. Arnold","We can. I am just curious as to why you think we -- maybe you could tell us why we should?","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Well I guess it would give you more time to do some risk reducing actions, that's the first thing that came to my mind. ","Doyle L. Arnold","Well. At this point if we -- as Harris mentioned the starting point for the resubmission, both because we requested it after almost in conjunction with the original submission because of the expectation that the interim final rule would be published, might change everything but formally I think it was February we requested a resubmission. ","We had even and we were, we are already engaged with the fed on that. Had we not have the shortfall on the DFAST test we would have been required to resubmit anyway. In both cases I believe the start date is the December 31 balance sheet. If we extend too far it's yet another resubmission with a new balance sheet date, nothing that we could do to de-risk today would count unless we rolled all the way forward to June 30th which I think might start to strain the federal reserve's patience and reasonably so. I mean it will be very hard to do something like that as under our understanding of the rules. ","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Okay, got you, that's very helpful. And just switching gears back to the CRE line, it's a nice growth there. I was just wondering can update us on where the national real estate portfolio sits today, what the change was in that portfolio of this quarter and how much run-offs you are still expecting there? ","Doyle L. Arnold","It did have run-offs. We're all kind of looking at ourselves, it's getting to be a smaller amount. We think it's around $2.8 billion and I believe the run-off was probably in the $100 million and $150 million range this quarter, lower into that range, closer to $100 million. ","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great thanks guys appreciate it. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Murray from ISI. Keith, please go ahead. ","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.","Thank you. Could you just touch a minute on the net interest income give up from CDO sales, could you box that in for us? And does your guidance on NII include any additional or contemplate any additional CDO sales there? ","Doyle L. Arnold","Yeah, a lot of the CDOs that we sold because they were among the riskier once were non-performing and so we weren't accruing. So we only reported a total of about $2 million of interest income in the first quarter on the securities that were sold. So thus the impact should not be particularly material --","Michael Morris","It's about half a day's worth of interest. ","Doyle L. Arnold","That address your -- and what I don\u2019t know is if we sold some of -- some accruing securities before their accrual date but that you took that into account, yeah. So it's not material. ","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.","Okay, thank you and then just going back to CCAR first again, is there anything that you've seen or understand your back and forth with the Fed that would make you revisit strategic decisions of how particular businesses are run or structured at this point in time? ","Harris H. Simmons ","Well I think -- I'll tell you and I tried to allude to this in the opening remarks, we're probably puzzled frankly by the magnitude of the drop in pretax pre-provision net revenue. And we don\u2019t have any real transparency into how they arrived at that number. We don't -- it's a number that is astonishingly large, I think relevant to other -- certainly other regional banks ","Doyle L. Arnold","It's small, the PPR\u2026","Harris H. Simmons ","Well the drop, the size of the decline is large the amount of the PPR is small, in other words and so I guess the answer to the question is no, it doesn't really lead us to any conclusions that are particularly useful. ","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc.","Fair enough, thank you very much. ","Operator"," Thank you. And our next question is from Marty Mosby from Guggenheim. Marty, please go head. ","Marty Mosby III - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. On the provision side what you are saying is the total losses were very low, you don't see any real deterioration in the asset quality metrics but we are going from a release, significant release I think a meaningful release to very little this quarter just matching the total loss and going back up next quarter what was the thought process for the world this quarter and then the rebound that you are kind of highlighting going into the future quarters? ","Doyle L. Arnold","It\u2019s fairly arcane. We had as you -- we didn\u2019t really highlight it in the talking points but there was a slight uptick in classified loans although all the other metrics were stable to improving but there was a slight uptick in classified loans. There were couple of fairly large credits at Amegy and at [inaudible] California that had a downgrade and that classified status makes a big jump in the quantitative portion of the reserve calculation but for that we would have had reserve releases probably similar to what you have seen in the prior quarter. ","We actually debated a lot about changing the qualitative factors to just not lean into the wind for all the reasons going to the qualitative factors as much but we decided to wait for one more kind of quarter's evidence and not do it just to offset the classified uptick. So it was a fairly and by the way and we don't think that the classified uptick is at all indicative of a trend so kind of just decided to wait another quarter and see how things develop but we are pretty confident that the general release trend will resume at that point.","Marty Mosby III - Guggenheim Securities LLC","","Got you. And just kind of a real technical question on the fair value and non-hedged derivative loss, like you said TRS kind of flips that around. Was there anything in that $8.5 million this quarter that was related to closing out the swap? I mean is that higher because they are something that all of a sudden popped because that\u2019s about $3 million higher than usual. ","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes there was actually about $2 million true up of one of the three legs of the swap related to the original forecast moves in LIBOR versus what actually occurred. So yes the total TRS cost this first quarter was more like $7.4 million instead of the usual $5.2 million to $5.4 million and then as I mentioned that will go to about $0.5 million in the second quarter for the stub period and then zero thereafter.","Marty Mosby III - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay that\u2019s all I wanted. Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question coming from John Pancari from Evercore. John, please go ahead.","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Good afternoon.","Harris H. Simmons ","Hi, John.","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners","To go back to the CCAR again, sorry do you necessarily need to wait until you hear back from the fed to raise capital if you decide to do so?","Doyle L. Arnold","No we -- well yes actually we do. We need technically under the capital plan rule any distributions of capital or any capital actions which were any raise of capital must be approved by the fed. We do have approval from the fed to raise the capital that was in the first submission so I guess we could go ahead and do that amount or up to that amount if we chose to but I think our posture is probably to let this process play out a bit more and make sure we\u2019re on the right track with them.","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Okay, all right. That makes sense. And then separately how do you think about how much of a buffer you think you will need over that 5%? So I know with your original expectation of that $400 million, you baked in a degree of a buffer over the minimum 5% so how you are thinking about it now in terms of meeting the minimum under the updated CCAR results?","Doyle L. Arnold","Do you have our conference rooms bugged?","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners","Yes.","Doyle L. Arnold","I mean, that\u2019s the issue because I mean as Harris mentioned there is a very large difference between what our PPNR models would project and what federal reserve\u2019s model would project or did project in the original submission. We know a lot about how our models work. The fed publishes as you know very-very little about how its models work. So yeah I mean we in the absence of any other information we have to think very long and hard about -- basically assume the fed will get to a number somewhere in the second round if it does as it did it in the first and we will see it accordingly that is the dilemma here. ","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners","All right, okay. And then I guess related lastly just on the CCAR still. I want to find out how are you thinking about the other actions as you're evaluating outside of a common equity raise and outside of CDO sales. I know you've thought about potentially selling or even securitizing commercial real-estate going forward. Can you talk about that a little bit how realistic of a possibility is that?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well. We -- I mean as I mentioned we're already constrained in our loan growth by self-imposed concentration limits. So those limits are self-imposed in part because of the severity of losses that would be projected by us in particularly land development construction lending. But it appears that the federal reserve's projections are even far, far more severe. So we do have to manage that risk but yet we've got a lot of really good customers and a lot of really good people out originating -- capable of originating good quality business. ","So we're looking at a variety of avenues, developing a more substantial and better organized syndications capability to originate and sell so we can continue to serve customers while laying off the risk or parts of it not, keeping all of it on our balance sheet. We're looking at the possibility of some originate flow origination partnerships with one or more parties and we're looking at ways to buy protection from people on some of the risk or stop loss coverage if you will. Nothing is eminent but it's clearly in a CCAR governing, stress test governing world it's something that we have to pursue very seriously and we're. ","John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners","Okay. Thanks Doyle. ","Doyle L. Arnold","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next come from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.","Harris H. Simmons ","","Hi, Joe.","Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. I was just curious about your thoughts on the DTA and to recapture some of that. I'd like, I guess given that your now selling more of the CDOs could the write- off be less from that as you also think about filling the hole and -- would be needed?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes. I mean the answer is yes the DTA was reduced, I think by around $80 million by the security sales and I think it's in the ball park of that number. And that should that's DTA that won't reappear in our stress test, so yes. And in effect the securities sales kind of had an after tax impact on stress losses because of the DTA write off in the stress. I am kind of -- if you don't know what we're Joe and I are talking about. I realized I didn't say all that very clearly I am sorry. ","Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets","Well I apologize for taking you down that path but I was curious. I also was wondering if you had any color on kind of geographic trends in loan growth this quarter.","Doyle L. Arnold","Who's got geographic trends? James you got a fancy chart for that or Michael. ","James R. Abbott","We actually did. We've got -- Joe I have got -- and part of this is we've got some bank selling participation's from one bank to the other but when you see the call report data you will see that Zions Bank and also Commerce Bank, Washington with strengths on the C&I front. On commercial real estate the biggest strength came from California and also Texas was the strongest out of those two. Both of them experienced actually pretty good term commercial real estate growth but also it's California's good construction funding's as Michael Morris spoke to earlier. ","Consumer book we did see a pretty good growth in most of the affiliate banks on the consumer side and that bodes pretty well for us. I would say while we are talking about it that on the consumer front we saw about a 25% reduction in origination volume on residential mortgage that was originated for sales. So it's a little bit softer quarter from that perspective that also fed in to the fee income line earlier but that gives you little bit of color around the footprint. ","Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets","Okay, that's great. Thank you so much. ","Harris H. Simmons ","Sorry about my babbling on the DTA, Joe. ","Joseph K. Morford III - RBC Capital Markets","I will follow up with James, thanks though.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from David Long from Raymond James. David, please go ahead. ","David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. ","Harris H. Simmons ","Hi, David. ","David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.","So following up on the geographical question you talked about concentration limits and some types and some geographies can you expand on that and provide any more color? ","Harris H. Simmons ","I don't think we want to get into what property types we might be holding back in which markets. We don\u2019t want to put our guys to the competitive disadvantage. I think you will kind of agree with us on that one. ","David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.","Okay. ","Harris H. Simmons ","I would say that generally we still have some room but it's I mean there are pockets geographically in some product types. But I would suspect that's not different from what you find in lot of other banks candidly. ","David J. Long - Raymond James Financial Inc.","Okay, and then as the follow-up regarding the high cost debt that you still have outstanding, can you pre-pay that without issuing like capital, is there an opportunity to do that at this point or is that put on the back burner till we get more clarity, late second quarter, early third quarter on the CCAR results? ","Doyle L. Arnold","No, debt is debt, it's not capital. I mean in our sub debt it was once tier 2 capital effectively is not. We can't pre-pay it in the sense that we tendered last year for high cost senior debt, we retired a little over half of it that way we tendered in the fourth quarter for sub debt. We've got some of that brought in. But at this point the rest of it will just come as it matures. ","There is just under $250 million of senior notes that cost us effectively 11.25%, that mature in September and we will pay those off with cash that we currently have on hand for back to the question how you're going to deploy the cash, that's a quarter of a billion of it. We have one issue of sub-debt that matures in May, it's less than $100 million. We'll pay that off with cash currently on hand.","The effective cost on that debt because of the discount amortization, when we modified it, is north of 20%. So it's very -- it's not a lot of it left outstanding but it's quite expensive and then the last of the really expensive debt is two more issues of subordinated debt that mature in, I think it's third quarter, second and third quarter of next year, September of next year, again costing us north of 20% and there is I believe in total $250 million or so of that. ","Harris H. Simmons ","We've also called four or five issues this quarter, that's about 130 million. ","Doyle L. Arnold","First quarter? ","Harris H. Simmons ","The second quarter. ","Doyle L.

Simmons ","Maybe we have time for one more question. ","Operator"," Okay. So we'll take our next question from [Jeffrey Elliot]. Jeffrey, please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hello there. On the CDO sales could you run through the total capital release that you've achieved so far and how much more potential there is just from reducing the Basel III risk weighted assets by selling down the CDOs? ","Doyle L. Arnold","The capital release really came in the form of stress capital release. The CDOs, well we sold some CDOs later in the quarter that were insurance only that were performing very-very well. In a perfect world we probably would have liked to held on to most of those but they were Volcker Rule prohibited even after the Interim Final Rule. But the stuff that we sold apart from that was going -- that which was projected to a result in the largest amount of OTTI in a severe stress environment that is other than temporary impairment which effects regulatory capital and I will remind you that the question what Joe Morford was asking about deferred tax asset because the losses were in total were severe enough in federal reserve severely adverse projections. ","It appears they wrote off entirely or disallowed our DTA which meant that all of that OTTI dollar for dollar had an after tax impact on capital. If you go back to what the fed published in the DFAST results securities losses were little over $300 million and we would have and that\u2019s a direct hit to capital. We would expect that that would be -- by our calculation we reduced that to somewhere near zero by the securities that were sold. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Doyle L. Arnold","That helped?","Unidentified Analyst","That helped. So the balances\u2026","Doyle L. Arnold","I\u2019ll say since you asked about Basel III we have also -- we also had an impact to mostly other tier 1 and tier 2 capital from the corresponding deductions approach because of this rather large portfolio and again essentially that\u2019s a dollar we have eliminated not all but a lot of that deductions from other tier 1 and tier 2 capital in the Basel III calculation by selling down the portfolio and [by the way] maybe that\u2019s what you are getting at when you ask the Basel III question. I am not sure.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay so the impact is on the numerator with a pretty small impact on the denominator then? ","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, well, on tier 1 comment it\u2019s a big impact on the numerator and it\u2019s not that big impact on the denominator but in the Basel III calculation it\u2019s an even bigger impact on the numerator in the non-common tier 1 because of the corresponding deductions approach. ","Unidentified Analyst","","Great, thanks very much.","Doyle L. Arnold","Okay.","Harris H. Simmons ","I think that\u2019s it, John.

I would now turn the call over to James Abbott. Please go ahead.","James R. Abbott","Good evening, and thank you, Patrick. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2013 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to the statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris H. Simmons","Thank you very much, James, and we welcome all of you to the call today. It's been a very eventful quarter for Zions Bancorporation. We are pleased with the loan growth we've seen. This was the strongest quarter in terms of loan growth that we've experienced since the second quarter of 2008. So that's quite notable. We're also encouraged that loan pricing on new production improved, albeit very modestly compared to the prior quarter. Credit quality improved significantly during the past year. Noncurrent assets, which include nonperforming assets plus loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, improved by nearly 40%, including a 13% improvement in the fourth quarter.","Additionally, I'm pretty happy to report that during the last year, the dollar amount of tangible common equity has increased 14%, approximately $500 million, and a fair amount of that is attributable to the value of the CDO portfolio improving, particularly during the fourth quarter. Zions has been in the news a lot lately regarding our CDO portfolio and the issuance and related implications of the Volcker Rule and the amendment or revision to it which was issued in January. Just last week, we announced our intent to sell a meaningful portion of our portfolio in an effort to materially reduce risk. And we believe that, that action will be materially beneficial to our capital ratios, particularly under a severe economic scenario in our stress tests.","On the capital front, our GAAP common equity capital ratios increased compared to the prior quarter, with the tangible common equity rising to 8.0% from 7.9% despite the loss in the quarter. This is primarily attributable to the improvement in fair value of the CDO securities. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio under Basel I declined to 10.2% from 10.5%, predominantly due to the growth in loans, but also due to the decline in retained earnings from the 2 charges mentioned in the earnings release. We estimate that our Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio will be comparable to the Basel I version at approximately 10.2%.","And finally, just a brief comment about credit quality. I continue to be very encouraged with the results that we are seeing there. Our net charge-offs are among the lowest of our peer bank group, and our gross charge-offs are significantly below many of our peers' net charge-offs. This quarter, net charge-offs were only 20 basis points on average loans on an annualized basis. We're also pleased to see that the nonperforming asset ratio has fallen to 1.15% of total loans and real estate owned. That's a level that we haven't seen since 2007. So there's been a fair amount of noise, but a lot of underlying strengthening.","And with that overview, I'll ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, good evening everyone. As noted in the release, the net income available to common for the full year was $294 million or $1.58 per diluted common share. For the fourth quarter, we posted a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $59.4 million or a loss of $0.32 per diluted common share. In the third quarter, we posted earnings of $209.7 million or $1.12 per common share. Of course, that quarter was -- included some unusual items related to the call of the Series C preferred stock and some other things that really inflated those earnings above what might be a normal run rate.","This quarter, there are 2 significant items which I'll review here. And you can refer to last quarter's earnings release, the call transcript or SEC filings for the items in the third quarter. Of course, the CDO impairment charges were the most significant. I will set those aside just for the moment, come back to them later and discuss the other one that was related to the successful tender for $250 million of subordinated debt. This resulted in debt extinguishment charges of about $80 million, some of which related to the tender premium itself and the rest was attributable to accelerated discount amortization. Most of this debt, the $230 million par of the $250 million par amount had been significantly modified in 2009 to give the holders the option to convert to preferred stock. And thus, at the time, the carrying value of the debt was reduced significantly to reflect both the market pricing of the debt at that time. That was back in 2009, as well as the value of the so-called beneficial conversion feature. That is the right to convert to preferred. All of these we've discussed in great detail in the last several years of filings and conference calls if you need more color.","The debt that was extinguished had a weighted average pretax cost for GAAP purposes of about 20% relative to the amortized cost amount of $192 million. And that, again, is related to the amortization of those discounts and features that I mentioned earlier. A related action was the issuance of $250 million of subordinated debt in September and November to prefund the November tender offer which had a weighted average cost of about 6%. Because of the timing, the full cost of the new issuance and the cost savings from the debt extinguishment was not fully reflected in the fourth quarter numbers, but will be for the first quarter of 2004.","James R. Abbott","'14.","Doyle L. Arnold","2014, yes, a decade here or there. We expect the net reduction of interest expense to be approximately $6 million in the first quarter relative to the interest expense on debt in the fourth quarter. The primary economic benefit to tendering for the debt early is not only the interest savings, but the ability to reduce idle cash balances at the parent company. We have a risk management practice of maintaining between 18 and 24 months of cash for any and all expected principal, interest and dividend payments, so-called time to required funding. And this practice is designed to greatly reduce liquidity and market access risk. By extinguishing this debt, which had less than 18 to 24 months left to maturity, we no longer need to hold idle cash to meet that liquidity objective. Further, to prevent the need for future tenders and associated tender premiums, much of the debt that we've issued in the last year or 2 has included a call feature at par, generally 2 years in advance of the maturity date, which is a practice that we plan to continue whenever market conditions make it possible.","Turning now to the CDO portfolio, as Harris discussed briefly earlier, and as many of you are aware, the situation with the regulatory treatment and, therefore, the accounting treatment for the bank trust preferred CDO securities has been quite volatile. In response to the initial Volcker Rule publication on December 10, we determined and announced that we could be required to take impairment charges on most of this portfolio in a press release, an 8-K. I think on about December 19, we quantified that on a pro forma basis for you. However, as most of you probably know, the situation became increasingly uncertain over subsequent days and weeks as various parties clamored for a change in the rule's applicability to bank TruPS CDOs. Meanwhile, we were in the midst of preparing our CCAR 2014 submission, which we had to prepare based on the application of the Volcker Rule to our CDO portfolio as it was announced originally. In addition to the immediate GAAP effects of the Volcker Rule, as it was initially issued and as we described on December 16, there were quite severe impacts on stress losses attributable to that portfolio. This is because basically under the Volcker Rule, future declines in value that would be projected under very low probability but severe economic stress scenarios would now all go through OTTI and impact regulatory capital ratios. In previous year's stress tests using pre-Volcker accounting treatment for the CDO securities, a meaningful amount of such hypothetical value declines under severe stress primarily impacted -- or at least partially impacted only our estimate of unrealized loss on the securities that would be captured in AOCI and had a lesser impact on impairment charges that went through the income statement. And the latter is the driver of changes to regulatory capital. Therefore, we would have had to hold more risk capital against a very low probability stress outcome, while in the meantime, market prices for the securities had recovered significantly relative to a couple of years ago or even a few quarters ago. While we still expect further recovery in value of the CDOs, this may occur over several years. While the additional capital required against immediate 9 quarter stress losses, hypothetical stress losses, would have to be held now. For some of the CDOs then, it was more capital efficient to sell rather than continue to hold the securities. Hedge fund and other buyers that appear to be active in the CDO market did not have the capital considerations of the 9 quarter stress testing process or regulatory risk weightings. Ultimately, the Volcker Rule was modified, as you probably know, and a large number of our CDO securities, including substantially all of the bank -- mostly bank trust preferreds, were grandfathered and thus would provide the necessary time to allow fair values of such securities to rise to their amortized cost. However, these TruPS CDOs would still be a source of significant, albeit reduced capital strain under severe stress tests. Therefore, having already selected prior to December 31, the bulk of the securities that we felt would be capital efficient to sell based on the original Volcker Rule, despite the issuance of the Interim Final Rule, we elected to continue with our plan to sell a portion of the securities portfolio. Let me see here, further, the sale of the selected high-risk security should position the company to cancel the total return swap since the portion of the portfolio and risk covered by it will be much smaller after completions of the sales. Canceling the TRS will add approximately $22 million to annual pretax earnings per -- whenever canceled, perhaps in the third -- beginning in the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we expect that the sales of the securities and related tax refunds using carryback treatment for ordinary losses generated by the sale of securities will add a few hundred million dollars of cash to the parent company, thus relieving the need to finance -- to refinance a like amount of maturing debt. Assuming an opportunity cost of 4% on the debt that we don't have to replace, that could be well north of $10 million in annual interest cost savings, perhaps in the -- roughly in the vicinity of $15 million, 1-5, not 5-0, $15 million of pretax savings. I expect there'll be follow-up questions on CDOs, so I'm going to move on to a few other topics now and leave that discussion.","Next, I'll move to a review of some of the key revenue drivers. If you want to turn to Page 16 of the press release, average loans held for investment increased $442 million compared to the prior quarter. End-of-period loan balances increased $795 million, excluding FDIC-supported and held-for-sale loans. As Harris mentioned, that was the strongest growth we've seen in a quarter in a number of years.","Also, unlike the last couple of years, that growth occurred fairly steadily throughout the quarter, although the weeks near the end of the year were a bit stronger still. We did see a modest reversal of the loan growth in the first couple of weeks of the first quarter of 2014, but again, nothing as severe as we've seen in the last 2 years. And at this point in January, loans are up a moderate amount relative to year-end, which we view as encouraging. If you recall, last year, we were already down several hundred million for the quarter at this point in time. And we have not seen anything like that kind of a runoff of the loan balances this year.","Our lenders are reporting that small business optimism is starting to improve. And thus, we may see some mix shift away from middle-market loan production toward the smaller business production. Whereas virtually all the C&I loan growth during the past couple of years had come from loans with commitments greater than $5 million where pricing, as you know, is thinner than in small business loans. So even though there are some indications that larger loan growth may be beginning to moderate, an improvement in small business lending would generate a mix that would be favorable to the net interest margin. Again, that's an outlook based on sentiment and optimism, not something we've actually started to see in the numbers yet. Line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans increased slightly relative to the prior quarter to 32.8%, up from 32.2% at the end of the quarter -- prior quarter. And again, that slight -- that uptick, although slight, it's not something that we've seen for quite a few quarters.","Before I leave Page 16, I believe it was, let me discuss the FDIC-supported loans and the income from that source. This is important to our outlook guidance, which is for stable to moderately declining net interest income over the coming year. We continue to experience quite strong performance of the loans in this portfolio. Prepayments continue to remain above our expectations and payoff values are well in excess of the prices we've marked the loans, which generates accelerated income in the yield of FDIC-supported loans. That was an annualized 37% for the fourth quarter or $33.8 million of total interest income. That's from loans that represent just 0.7% of total earning assets.","Just 3 months ago, we expected the total remaining income from this portfolio to be roughly $95 million, the substantial majority of which would be recognized by the end of 2015. Even after the very strong fourth quarter results that I just mentioned, we revised our expectations to an estimate of more than $80 million yet remaining or, in other words, about a $20 million bump in the total expected revenue when factoring in those actual results from the fourth quarter. So while this income has significantly outperformed our expectations in the last few quarters, all good things must eventually end. And we know that this will eventually decline. And it could be fairly rapidly at some point as we come to the kind of the end of the workout periods for those loans. The indemnification asset expense related to this loan book, which is recognized in other noninterest expense, should amount to $23 million and be exhausted between now and the end of this year.","Turning to the margin and net interest income. On Page 16, you'll note that the NIM increased considerably compared to the prior quarter, 11 basis points. Most of which -- most of that increase was attributable to the FDIC-supported loans, about 10 out of the 11 basis points. The growth in the loan portfolio and the slight reduction in cash contributed to the remaining lift in the NIM. Primary offset was the weaker yield on loans held for investment, again excluding the FDIC-supported loans. Although we ceased providing a core net interest income number, we did commit to giving you the components so that you could continue to calculate it. The additional accretion is found in the table at the bottom of Page 12 equaling $28.5 million, and the discount amortization on sub debt was $11.9 million. Adjusting for these factors, there was about a $2 million linked quarter increase in net interest income, marking the third consecutive quarterly increase, although it was slight.","Turning to noninterest income after adjusting for the noise of the securities gains and losses. This is a pretty straightforward quarter with 2 notable items. First was the decline in loan sales and servicing, which is attributable to a drop in mortgage refinancing volume, which shouldn't come as a surprise to any of you. Our refi volume declined 47% sequentially and purchase volume declined 13%. The second item pertains to other noninterest income which dropped by $3 million. However, compared to the prior quarter -- however, that prior quarter included a $4 million gain on the sale of several branches from our California bank. So excluding this onetime third quarter item, other noninterest income was essentially flat.","Looking at noninterest expense. We have guided to a number near $400 million, excluding the debt extinguishment charge. Making the extinguishment charge adjustment, total noninterest expense actually came in at $415 million compared to our guidance. Because of the acceleration of payoffs on FDIC-supported loans, the indemnification asset expense was higher than our expectations by $9 million. That's good news. It just happens to show up as bad news in noninterest expense because it was more than offset by the higher or stronger revenue that I -- from FDIC loans that I discussed previously. The remaining higher cost came from provision for unfunded commitments attributable to strong growth in that area. Most of the increase in professional fees was attributable to consulting and other efforts related to the preparation of our CCAR stress test submission.","I'll wrap up now with an outlook. And that reminder that this outlook is kind of trying to look out over the course of the upcoming year, not just the current quarter and kind of as compared -- so the next 4 quarters, really, as compared to the most recent quarter. We're maintaining our outlook for loan growth to be slight to moderate over the 1-year horizon. Loans have continued to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter. We are hearing that, as I mentioned earlier, that pipelines for larger loan sizes have softened a bit compared to the recent past. And some of our banks are taking on -- are trying to take a more firm stance against pricing erosion. However, as I also noted, we're hearing that small business customers are becoming significantly more optimistic than they were 6 months ago, which may help drive loan growth a bit stronger than we saw in 2013.","Net interest income. On a GAAP basis, including the effect of the expected declines in interest income from FDIC-supported loans, we expect net interest income to decline modestly. FDIC-supported loan income for the fourth quarter was $34 million. And we expect an average of only $12 million per quarter in 2014. In addition, although we're encouraged that new production yields did not decline further in the fourth quarter, we note that the weighted average yield on production this most recent quarter was around 3.8%, while the weighted average yield on the whole existing book is 4.4%. So there is downward pressure on loan yields, on average, even though at the margin, they have stabilized.","Partially offsetting the pressure on the asset side of the balance sheet should be the benefit of extinguishing a significant amount of high cost subordinated debt and reducing other term debt expenses I mentioned earlier.","For the noninterest income, we expect the less volatile components of noninterest income, such as service fees to continue their modest upward trend.","On noninterest expense, we expect a decline in the first quarter due to a lack of debt extinguishment expense and perhaps some relief on the professional and legal services fees. There'll be the usual seasonal increases in health care and payroll taxes, primarily the latter, as well as some increase in salaries related to various projects, such as our core systems upgrade. Beyond the first quarter, we expect expenses to remain relatively stable at around $1.6 billion annually, with increases coming from the core systems upgrade, while offset by a continued reduction in credit-related and deposit insurance expenses. Variables, such as the provision for unfunded lending commitments and the FDIC indemnification asset expense, are difficult to forecast. We expect the provision expense, our provision for loan losses to remain modestly negative for perhaps at least another couple of quarters, although the negative provision probably will come to an end sometime after that if loan growth continues, even if with continued strong credit quality. Preferred dividends should be in the mid-$60 million area for the year 2014.","With that, I will -- I leave in the opening soliloquy and ask the operator to open up the lines for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Given the comments you made on the TRS going away possibly by 3Q, I guess that means this is a part of the capital actions you submitted with your -- the CCAR this year? And do you actually need to complete the sales of those CDOs you marked before you think you can get rid of it?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm not going to comment on exactly what was or wasn't in our CCAR submission. I'm just going to leave it as -- our expectation is, we will be able to sell it -- or excuse me, cancel it. Yes, and as we've mentioned, canceling it does in part result from de-risking the portfolio in these certain ways that I've described, kind of getting rid of some of the more capital inefficient ones for us to hold. And that does facilitate the potential termination of the TRS. I'm not sure there's -- I'm not sure I'd 100% say, if this, then that. That one is an absolute, both necessary and sufficient condition, but they're pretty strongly linked in our mind.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And just one quick follow-up. You mentioned stable loan production rates this quarter, and that they're still lower than the book yield. But the book yield actually held up pretty well this quarter. I was just wondering if you can give any color as to what drove that greater stability this quarter versus what we've seen in the prior few quarters?","Doyle L. Arnold","James, do you want to comment, give any color on that?","James R. Abbott","Yes, we just -- I mean, we had a lower rate of prepayments this quarter. The yield on the production was up about 4 basis points compared to the prior quarter. That's unadjusted for mix, just the overall total production. Production was a little bit stronger than it was in the prior quarter, but nothing to write home about, per se, but both quarters had reasonably good production statistics, so. One of the loan types which is about 1\/2 of our production typically is C&I. And the C&I production yield is equaling now roughly the yield on the C&I book. So that's actually helpful and probably a contributor to why the book yield did not decline quite as much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk us through your -- the IT projects and in terms of helping us understand -- we're at this $400 million a quarter type of run rate level, and it seems like that's about the right rate to stay for a while. So can you kind of walk us through what still has to kind of come on board? And at what point you can finally start sunsetting some of the other pieces so that we can actually anticipate a decline from that $400 million level or so at some point?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, for this year, very roughly speaking, the ramp-up of expenses related to the core systems and accounting projects that we've described is still not fully there. I mean, actually the expenses related to those projects will be increasing somewhat this year. But some of the other costs that were noninterest expense, including some of the regulatory expenses and hopefully, that some of the other -- some of the consulting and other costs that were like related to CCAR should -- they won't go away, but they will decline from current levels. And that the goal is to roughly offset those. To have those 2 offset each other, to keep expenses flat to very modestly higher. But the first system sunsetting will not occur until the latter half of 2015. And that's when you will begin to see the savings in the latter half of '15 and then '16 and '17 from the core systems. It will take several years to go through each of the different loan systems to get those savings and consolidate some of the operations, et cetera.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my follow-up question just relates to earning assets. And to your point that you expect to see slight to moderate growth on the loan side this year, can you talk to us a little bit about what you expect on the deposit side and whether or not you think loans will technically outgrow earning asset growth?","Doyle L. Arnold","So basically, another way to -- let me just sort of rephrase your question, make sure I got it. So you're asking, do we think loans will grow faster than deposits this year for the first time in a number of years? Is that...","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Basically, yes. And frankly, yes, do you expect -- because you guys had the possibility of mix shifting for a while on the cash side, but now there's the liquidity stuff, and you're not really building the securities book, so I'm just wondering how should we think about deposits to loans and deposits -- and loans to earning assets?","Doyle L. Arnold","The deposit, I mean I think we saw signs of deposit growth moderating in 2013 and I think we would expect, if the economy continues to slightly improve, I think we would expect to see those signs continue. And our free cash balances for the company as a whole are already down a couple of billion dollars from their peak, which was over 1 year ago, a rough -- kind of a couple of peaks over the course of early 2013, and maybe sometime in 2012. Though they're down a couple of billion dollars and we haven't added a lot of securities. So we are already seeing loan growth begin to absorb some of that. And that's our goal. I mean, securities, we would -- we only consider as a kind of an outlet for free cash that -- for which there is no loan demand, in an environment where [Audio Gap] largely to be unacceptable, and haven't invested a lot in securities. And I think -- I don't think there's any basic change in our stance. With this moderate loan growth, I think we'd probably will continue to absorb some of the excess cash over the course of this year, and not deploy a lot in the securities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Really, my question's just a clarification for kind of understanding what really changed, that drove the stronger loan growth this quarter? It sounds like comparable production levels. Is it just that your overall level of paydown activity slowed in the quarter and, what kind of visibility you have towards that, going forward?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, that's -- in answer to the first part of your question, the answer is yes. I mean it -- there was a little bit of pickup in originations, but we've had higher than expected prepayment, not on Residential Mortgages, but on other loans for several quarters now and that prepayment rate slowed significantly in the fourth quarter. Hard -- and that, there's a sense that, that was potentially related to the uptick in long term -- longer term rates. Refinancing maybe wasn't as unbelievably attractive as it was in the third quarter and then the second quarter. But it's -- you ask what kind of visibility do we a have, it's cloudy and probably dependent on the further path of long-term rates. If you think they're going to -- despite the kind of coming down from the 3% level since year-end, if you think the trend is stable to drifting upward on long-term rates as the fed tapers, then you should probably expect that prepayments will continue to be lower. And if you're not that -- don't have that rate path in mind, then you might come to a different conclusion.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The other question was just, can you give us a little more color on the improvement in the market values of the CDOs that you've seen, and just some of the liquidity in the market, too, that's giving you the encouragement now to maybe sell some of these?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes. We -- it was really interesting. I'll give you kind of what we can observe, a little of what we can observe directly, and then what we heard in the way of market color. What we observed directly was we actually put out for bid 2 different, relatively small groups of securities sales in December. One, kind of earlier in the month, and then one which we hadn't originally planned later in the month, but we wanted to validate -- some validation points on what the impact of the Volcker rule was, thinking that it's possible that it would have a negative impact. On the contrary, the prices that we got on 10 or 12 small tranches in late December were higher than what we got on some small tranches in early December. And the market color that we had was that, the Volcker rule actually sparked a lot of interest in an asset class that had sort of been ignored by a number of potential buyers who, because there hadn't been much trading, didn't perceive any ability to deploy much cash, and so had largely stayed out of it. But the possibility that there would be more sales by the current holders of them sparked a lot of interest by buyers, thinking that these -- there is a positive outlook for this particular security class and maybe we can buy enough of it to make it worth our while, to actually do the work and go through our internal processes and get involved in this market. That's what we were hearing from several dealers. That's kind of what we're -- we've heard in some direct calls, so.","Harris H. Simmons","I think combined with the fact that bank failure rates have clearly come way down and seem to be in pretty good control, and so the underlying quality is appearing to be much better than it was, say, 1 year ago.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, I think that's right. And again, there, I would draw your attention back to my comments where I tried to distinguish between the fact that bank failure rates are way down, deferrals are way down and by every objective measure, the quality of these securities is improving. But certain classes of holders have to pretend that none of that will continue starting tomorrow morning in a stress test, and that they will be buffeted by an extremely adverse event that has an extremely low probability of occurring. So -- but the -- if you're -- if you don't have to take that into account per se, then you might have a very different outlook on those securities, and I think that's what's going -- appears to be going on in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Could you spend a second with an update on asset sensitivity or the duration of your deposits? You guys gave a lot of color on that in the third quarter. Was there any change in the fourth quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","Not material, not materially, no. And we'll be -- I don't happen to have it in front of me to update, but I think we'll wait, under -- there's been no material change, and I think in the 10-K we'll give a complete kind of breakdown of all of that. We didn't deploy cash into long-dated securities, particularly those with negative convexity. A lot of our loan growth was in C&I loans, which have a relatively modest duration. The balance growth was in DDA, which is -- with a lot of it commercial DDA. So none of the underlying drivers changed materially.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then on the credit side, give us a sense of what the recovery pipeline looks like, and any color you could provide around the very small pickup in C&I charge-offs that just -- poised to run in such a low base right now?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, you're at such a low base that kind of any charge-off now can affect the net amount, and we had -- we kind of had one $7.5 million kind of charge-off that alone, by itself, was almost equal to all of the charge-offs last quarter. So you're just in a volatile -- at a point where any normal C&I charge-off can move -- can double or halve the net charge-off rate, and that's all it was. All of the underlying drivers are fundamentally positive.","Harris H. Simmons","It's hard to say that when we expect the level of net charge-offs to remain quite low through the course of this year. But at those very low levels, you could see some volatility. I mean, it could be 10 basis points, 25 basis points the next quarter. I mean, it's going to bump around, just because you're at a...","Doyle L. Arnold","I think the -- what you -- I would suggest you focus on is the fact that all of the metrics for -- that we disclosed for -- around credit quality other than net charge-offs continue to improve, and we continue to release reserves by providing -- had a negative provision this quarter. We would not have had that had we seen some underlying indicator that the favorable trends were about to reverse. With regard to recoveries, there's not that much in the way of recoveries out there. There will continue to be some. This volatility was driven by a -- 1 or 2 single charge-offs.","James R. Abbott","This is James. I'll just add real quick that from a flow perspective of the inflows into the nonaccruals and classifieds, those are down substantially from the prior quarter's rate and the favorable resolutions, which are payoffs and paydowns as opposed to charge-offs, favorable resolutions on the classified loans were 94% of the total resolutions that we processed this quarter. So it was really a very, very strong quarter from that perspective, and similar types of levels for the non-performing assets as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","The total returns swap cancellation that will come out of noninterest expense?","Doyle L. Arnold","It's a net interest income.","James R. Abbott","Not non-interest income.","Doyle L. Arnold","It is? Okay, I'm sorry. Yes.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Noninterest income?","Harris H. Simmons","Jennifer, it's on the -- the line item that it shows up is the fair value and nonhedged derivative loss. So it was a -- I think it's $5.2 million. And then the line item this quarter shows $5.3 million negative. But it's in the fee income section.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is just a follow-up to Ken Usdin's question on the expenses. So as we put together your outlook for the year, it seems like, give or take, we're going to come out to a core efficiency ratio of about 70%. As we look beyond this year, and think about the efficiency improvements that can come out, especially from the IT spending, and some of the CCAR expenses going away, in a revenue backdrop where your loan growth is getting better and the yield curve is steepening, where can we expect your midterm efficiency ratio to settle out to, without assuming any movement on the short end?","Doyle L. Arnold","I don't have a number to give you. Sorry. It's -- there's no reason, long-term, that we should have an efficiency ratio materially different from other regional banks. I'll just leave it at -- wherever they are, is probably where we're going to end up. That the, again, the goal is to kind of keep expenses as flat as we can for the next 1.5 years, while we absorb these very large project expenses and then let the combination of the expense reductions, as we do phase out the old systems in the latter half of '15 into '16, and the effect of rising loan growth and interest rates, impact our asset sensitive position kind of over the same time period. It's -- in my view, it's not just an expense issue. It's also a revenue issue. We could \"fix\" the efficiency ratio really quickly, by buying several billion dollars of mortgage-backed securities and pumping up the revenue as a number of institutions have done, but we've elected not to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on the C&I growth in the quarter, up 5% linked quarter. I know you implied that a lot of the loan progress on the commercial side was from the lower paydowns. So can you just give us an expectation on the real -- where you're seeing the improvement and then, how can we think about the pace of C&I growth going forward? It probably can't stay at the 5% linked quarter pace, I'm assuming.","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I'd just point out to start, and I'll probably ask James if he has any additional color, but I'll point out, in the release itself, we've noted geographically where the loan growth had come from by, which of our states if -- I would also note that fourth quarter, almost every year is this -- is by margin, the strongest loan growth quarter we have. There's a high degree of seasonality in the pattern of our loan growth. So that's -- so just from that loan, I would say yes, it's probably not sustainable. But I tried to mention, what's interesting is that the growth in the quarter was not just in the last few weeks, like 3 or 4 weeks the way it was last year, and the year before. It occurred rather -- throughout the quarter, with still some noticeable increase in the last few weeks, but not nearly as severe. We would have had a very good quarter if we just cut it off around -- in early December. At the same time, we haven't seen the runoff of the spike up in the first quarter so far. It hasn't continued with strong loan growth but remember, last year, we were down $0.5 billion in the first quarter, and I don't remember the number from 2012 Q1, but it was also hundreds of millions of dollars down. So far, at least, we do not appear to be on a course that's going to get us to a down quarter. It may be flattish, but that would be a huge improvement over the last few years. It's up, not quite $50 million through whatever it was last Friday, just for the -- for -- since year end for the month of January, just to give you a little bit of perspective. So with that, James, you have any color on what, where, when, how?","James R. Abbott","Well, John, it was really a strong quarter, obviously for C&I, and it was really across the board. I mean, we had -- Nevada had $86 million worth of growth in C&I, for example, and Nevada's a smaller bank for us, and has not had the strongest economy. So that kind of gives you -- put that in context there. California's $127 million worth of growth. Texas, $224 million. So it was really quite strong, and the number of the franchises -- the one, actually, franchise that stands out is the Utah, Idaho franchise, Zions National -- First National Bank or Zions Bank, and that was only up $16 million. So there are -- there, it's -- we weren't firing on maybe all the cylinders, but we were firing on most of the cylinders in the quarter.","Doyle L. Arnold","Before there's a follow-up question on what on earth are we finding to lend to on Nevada, I'd just caution that some of that growth that James articulated is internal participations bought from our own banks in order to kind of, manage liquidity internally. Nevada has a lot of excess deposits at the moment that we're trying to put to deploy.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is really around the margin. We just want to get your thoughts around how we should expect the core margin, excluding any purchase accounting-related impacts? How we should expect that to trend in coming quarters? Is it fair to assume ongoing pressure, given the new loans are still coming on well below the book yield?","Doyle L. Arnold","You've got what, 60 basis points of difference between the average yield and the marginal yield. In a loan book that has a, I don't know, kind of an average pricing period of 1.5 years to 2 years. So if you divide -- keep it simple, divide 60 by 8 quarters, you're at 7 to 8 basis points per -- 7.5 basis points a quarter of pressure. If everything stays stable, right where it is, you can calculate yourself that to offset that much pressure on loan growth at 3.8 would take a few hundred million dollars of loan growth to offset it. So the most -- net-net, most of the pressure that we can't offset is in the FDIC-supported loans. That's the -- that's sort of the unmitigatable drag, if you will. The core margin with some modest loan growth, maybe close to stable. It was up 1 or 2 basis points this last quarter. I mean, that's just some high-level math I'm doing on the fly here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","You made a comment at the end of your opening statements about loan growth being better at the mid-tier firms versus the large firms, and that some of the bigger banks now are not being as competitive on pricing. Can you add any more color to that?","Doyle L. Arnold","Not a lot. I mean...","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess the question is, some of the bigger guys were very aggressive on pricing, with the higher yield curve. Is that -- some of that pressure going away?","Doyle L. Arnold","I -- personally, I think it's probably too soon to call a trend or turn there. I hope so, but, I don't know.","Harris H. Simmons","Probably one of the things that will be interesting, Paul, is to see whether the biggest banks start pushing the capital that they're holding in the parent company down to their pricing models. Because when pricing models are based on 7% common equity, and everybody's holding 10, it makes you look like you can push pricing down. I think people are starting to understand that dynamic. I know that we're talking about it. And so you may, at some point, start to see that happen among the biggest banks and, of course, they're the price leaders.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then, a second question: You have a pretty diverse geographic region. Is there any area that's doing better than others? We know Texas is doing well, but how's Vegas and California for loan growth? I mean, are you seeing the same across all of your banks? Or is one group doing better than the other?","Doyle L. Arnold","We'll let Harris take that, because he's just been around to most of them.","Harris H. Simmons","Well, I'd say that it's -- I mean it still varies. Las Vegas is certainly getting better. That's -- as Doyle said, we've been selling participations to them because they have a lot of liquidity, but they're also seeing better loan production there, small business lending is actually coming along pretty nicely there. We're seeing, certainly in the Arizona market, things have -- not just this past quarter. I -- in fact, I don't know that I've seen the numbers this quarter or I haven't focused on them. But generally speaking, that's a market where we've seen quite a lot of improvement, in terms of production. We've seen good growth in Colorado. So it's kind of across the board. In Utah, Idaho market, which is an important market for us, we have kind of a, some run off portfolio there that is offsetting underlying growth. But beneath that, they're actually seeing some pretty good production. So, I guess we talked earlier about prepayments coming down. I mean, I -- the same factors are in effect there, I think, that are -- that you're seeing with residential mortgage refinancing. I mean, it's -- some point, it kind of runs its course, and I think a lot of that, probably a lot of the steam has gone out of the refi market in the commercial term CRE segment. So hopefully, that bodes well for a little better net growth going forward and...","James R. Abbott","I'll just mention real quick that we -- just looking at the -- talk about what Harris is mentioning on the prepayments activity, we saw about 70, almost $80 million worth of loan growth out of the commercial, of the term commercial real estate portfolio this quarter. The prepayments on that portfolio were $100 million less than they were in the prior quarter. So if we, just see no change in prepayments, we would have actually had a little bit of attrition, which is what we'd seen for several quarters out of that commercial real estate portfolio. So, it really was just a prepayment activity, the prepayments being dropped from 32% last quarter to about 27% this quarter, and that's just one example, but you see it in the C&I portfolio as well and others.","Doyle L. Arnold","Operator, I think we have a couple left, and we'll try to give short answers and then wrap it up promptly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question. I wonder if -- looking at the schedules on Page 4 of the release for the CDOs, I don't think you guys have actually given any more guidance, as far as level of the planned sale for these CDOs. I guess if you just look at the reduction in amortized cost from September to December, and with that, looking at the $220 million pretax impairment charges, it does kind of seem the nonperforming CDOs would be a big portion of what I would -- what took the additional impairments. So is there any way that we should be thinking about the movements within that last fourth quarter for the OTTI and trying to back into a level of, what you guys are planning to sell here?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm not going to help you at all. We're trying to back into that number. We'll talk about that when we've done what we planned to do. What I will tell you is that, that includes the impairment from several sources, CDOs that we still have to sell per Volcker, or not have to sell, we at least have to -- can no longer say they're AFS, or can't, we can't necessarily recover our amortized cost that comes from a little bit that would've occurred due to a weakness in a particular bank issuer that would've cost some OTTI, had no Volcker, and that's an -- and it's an estimate of -- from CDOs that we may attempt to sell, and -- but I am, for reasons I think you can probably understand, I'm not going to give you the breakdown of that.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got you, got you. And then just a quick question, the security's portfolio, AFS, looks like you added to that securities portfolio during the quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","That's a transfer from held-to-maturity on some -- as I mentioned, there are some securities that even after the amendment or with your interim final rule to modify the final rule, that we are not allowed to hold to maturity. We have to sell. So yes, there's some movement that was still required from HTM to AFS. And then there were some sales that we did in the fourth quarter as well.","Harris H. Simmons","And let me just add. If you're looking on Page 9, maybe it's easier for me to point it out on a comparative balance sheet, you'll see that in fact, the accumulated other comprehensive income, as we've stated, went from a negative $384 million to $192 million negative, and the fact of the matter is, that means that the available for sale securities went up. I mean these offset each other. The available for sale securities in the balance sheet are on the books at market value. Since there's been a dramatic increase in the market value, you can see that the securities number went up there. There were not many purchases, it was a change -- that's the change.","Operator","The next question comes from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Doyle, just quickly on the expense outlook. You mentioned that on a GAAP basis, expenses would be down year-over-year, and I was wondering -- just wanted -- if you could give a little bit more perspective on the unfunded lending commitments? That's kind of been volatile quarter-to-quarter. The last quarter, I think you had one of your weaker quarters on production, and now we're looking at one of the better quarters. I'm just trying to figure out, just from more of a modeling standpoint, how you're thinking about that with your kind of modest loan growth outlook, in conjunction with the likelihood that the professional's going to come down, and you're looking at kind of a more stable run rate the rest of the year?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, Todd, I think I mentioned, and trying to go through the expense outlook that I wasn't including a couple of volatile elements, notably the unfunded commitments. I would remind you, I believe it was last quarter, third quarter, that we had a onetime change in the way in which we estimated that provision. We basically switched from using some allowed metrics under Basel rules. There were some -- you can default a certain assumed draw down rates, and we had been using that because of a lack of data. As we accumulated data, we switched over to using our own historical experience. That's what drove the decline last quarter, not a weakness in originations. I think maybe, something like this quarter is more -- is maybe a little strong in the way of originations, but something in the low to mid-single digits might be a reasonable estimate for the unfunded commitment provision, positive, not negative, on -- as a per quarter, for a run-rate basis. Does that help you?","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I appreciate the clarification. That's very helpful, thanks.","Operator","This ends our Q&A session. I'll turn it back to management for closing remarks.","James R. Abbott","Well thank you very much, Patrick, and thank you, everyone for participating today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","Thank you, Candace, and good evening. We welcome you all to this conference call to discuss our 2016 third quarter earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation, and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.","We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer section. We ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask question.","With that, I will turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you today to our call to discuss the third quarter results. On slide three are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.57 from $0.41 per share in the year-ago quarter. By using the same adjustments we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily adjusts for securities portfolio gains in this case, earnings per share increased about 26% over the prior year third quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.","If you go to slide four, we're on track with all of the targets we outlined in our June 2015 efficiency announcement. We continue to look for opportunities to reduce expenses. For example, the number of total full-time equivalent employees was down 251 or about 2.5% at the end of September from where it was a year ago. And revenue growth also remains a primary focus to drive earnings growth.","On slide five, we are pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of both solid net interest income growth, which increased 10.7% over the past year, and a 10.3% improvement in adjusted noninterest income with the primary adjustment again being the elimination of securities gains. And as noted, we're also focused on maintaining expenses at a level that we expect to be essentially flat to the back end of last year.","Turning to slide six, we posted an efficiency ratio of 66% in the third quarter and are at 66.3% for the year-to-date number. Recall our goal for 2016 is to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66% while maintaining adjusted noninterest expense below $1.58 billion.","Although not shown on this page, I'll point out that adjusted noninterest expense was above the target rate in the third quarter, which is largely attributable to several items that we expect to not recur in the fourth quarter. Paul Burdiss will review this a little later in his prepared remarks. I'd also note that we are achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects.","Moving to slide seven, we experienced soft loan growth in the third quarter which we largely expected when we discussed the prior quarter results back in July and then highlighted during the quarter at a conference appearance. We weren't alone as the industry generally experienced tepid growth. For Zions, the primary reasons for the linked quarter softness in loan growth were twofold. First, oil and gas loan balance has declined more than $250 million in the third quarter. And secondly, we are, as we've noted, being quite conservative on commercial real estate lending. In fact, we had more than $450 million less in new commercial real estate originations this past quarter as compared to the prior two quarter average.","In the third quarter we experienced stronger growth in consumer loans, which were up 2.3% relative to the prior quarter end, and 10% over the prior year. Overall, over the past year we experienced what we feel to be an acceptable 6% growth in loans and 4% growth in deposits. Prudent loan growth is among our top priorities and some of the steps we're taking to help ensure that growth include finding ways to accelerate the time required to move loan applications through the approval and funding process and adding additional mortgage loan originators and devoting additional resources in a couple of our specialty lending areas.","Moving to slide eight, as a general comment, we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle. And we don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall credit quality metrics were relatively consistent with those we reported in the prior quarter with a moderate increase in nonperforming assets, but a decline in both gross and net loan charge-offs.","Slide eight looks at the credit quality indicators of the non-oil and gas portfolio. In the third quarter we experienced net loan recoveries of $11 million, bringing the year to date figure to a net recovery of $10 million on a portfolio of about $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans.","On slide nine, you can see that with regard to the oil and gas lending portfolio, we remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally although we do expect the oilfield services portfolio to weigh on credit quality for a while longer.","With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin on slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $117 million or $0.57 per share.","Harris has just discussed the increases in two key revenue line items and I'll talk a bit more about expenses shortly. But before we leave this page, I'd like to highlight two key areas. First, return on assets has increased to 84 basis points, up from 69 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased 7.9% from 6.1% in the year-ago period. We are committed to increasing these measures of balance sheet return on profitability and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement.","Let me make a few comments about our revenue. About three-quarters of our revenue comes from net interest income driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer-related funding.","Slide 11 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios. We remain encouraged with growth in the areas that are targeted for growth although we certainly would have liked to see more growth in the third quarter, especially in C&I.","As we mentioned in the second quarter earnings call, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward. And, indeed, in the third quarter relative to the second quarter CRE loans increased at an annualized rate of just less than 5% which is slower than the 11% rate of increase relative to the year-ago period.","Total originations in CRE declined more than 30% from the prior two quarter average for more than $450 fewer originated. We expect non-oil and gas, commercial and industrial and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate portfolio and the oil and gas portfolio.","Slide 12 outlines the recent trends in net interest income which continued to demonstrate growth in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 10.3% when compared to the third quarter of 2015, driven by $2.5 billion of growth in average loans and $4.6 billion of growth in the investment portfolio.","While we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates as shown in the box at the bottom right hand side of the slide, we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans. The interest rate risk characteristics of which, when combined with continued growth of customer deposits, have resulted in a somewhat less asset-sensitive position than has been the case in recent years.","Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point short-term rate increase would produce between $25 million and $30 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the size and composition of the balance sheet. It will take a few quarters for the impact of any short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized as only about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR prime. As a reminder, our performance objectives, that were initially communicated in June 2015, assume one additional 25 basis point Fed fund target rate increase in December of 2016.","Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the third quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position and in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and to better balance the company's risk return profile. During the third quarter, the available for sale investment portfolio increased to net $872 million when compared to the prior quarter.","We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about four years with a duration extension risk being only about a half a year if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio including our floating rate SBA securities is about 2.8 years today, and if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree.","Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of the investment portfolio and loan production, can be seen on slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 5 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.11%. Some of that compression was attributable to a decline in income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009. The remainder was primarily due to reduced fee income that is amortized on commercial loans as the weighted average coupon of the portfolio declined only 1 basis point when compared to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield dipped again this quarter similar to the move in the prior quarter, which was primarily due to increased premium amortization.","Turning to slide 15 and noninterest income, total noninterest income increased $145 million from $126 million in the year-ago period. Customer-related fees, as stated in the slide and in the press release, increased to $125 million from $113 million a year ago. The notable areas experiencing significant growth include mortgage, treasury management, and wealth management. Within customer-related fees, there were about $3 million of income that came from a variety of items that are unlikely to reoccur in our opinion.","Outside of customer-related fees, approximately $11 million of the income in noninterest income was attributable to the strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in our small business investment company portfolio. We would not expect that income to recur in future quarters.","Noninterest expense on slide 16 increased 3.1% from the prior year and, if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in our GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back, the increase was closer to 5.6% from the year-ago period. However, as noted on the slide, there were a few items that caused the result to be elevated which we do not necessarily expect to recur in future quarters. Some of these items include, for example, an adjustment to our healthcare and benefits costs which is about $5 million impacting the salaries and employees benefits line item. Some of this was related to an elevated level of lump sum pension distributions and, as you know, this is where employees choose to withdraw their pension benefits all at once. There was an adjustment to professional services costs of about $2 million related to further enhancements in our risk modeling. There was a linked quarter increase of about $8.5 million in the amount set aside for legal settlements and judgments. And some of the elevated expense was partially offset by a lower accrual for executive compensation which impacted the salary and benefit line.","In summary, when you add the pluses and minuses, the total noninterest expense line item was a few million dollars higher than what we believe is a typical quarterly run rate. We remain confident in achieving our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion of adjusted noninterest expense for 2016. As we said in our February Investor Day, if we cannot achieve this goal through reducing inefficiencies within the company, we will reduce executive compensation.","Finally on slide 17, we have increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share per quarter. Additionally, we began executing on our common equity buyback plan which calls for $180 million between July 2016 and June 2017. We expect to maintain a relatively strong capital ratio but we do believe the company is overcapitalized relative to its risk profile and the buyback plan should be helpful in keeping that overcapitalized position from strengthening further.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Thank you, Paul. Well, let me start with just a high level commentary on the oil and gas portfolio, and that is that we remain cautiously optimistic. We've seen strong equity injections into the companies during the third quarter and borrower and sponsor sentiment has certainly improved in many of the segments. However, at the same time we continue to experience difficult challenges in the oilfield services portfolio that we believe will continue well into next year.","On balance, we think the impact to earnings from oil and gas problem credits over the next several quarters will be substantially less than what we've been experiencing over the last year or so. Simply because, over the last two years, we've been building the reserve against the oil and gas portfolio and charge-offs were ramping up. And over the next year or more, we expect the charge-offs will be tapering down and we are in the early innings of seeing reserve releases.","Over the next four quarters we expect oil and gas net charge-offs to trend downwards somewhat from the last 12 months, reflecting our continued cautious optimism. And we expect that we'll experience the gradual release of the oil and gas allowance for credit losses over the coming quarters.","On slide 18, we show on the left side of the slide the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream, services and other, which is essentially the mid and downstream portfolio primarily centered in midstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased $256 million from the prior quarter. This was probably the greatest decline in energy outstandings we've seen in any quarter to date. Additionally, we're seeing a fairly large number of favorable resolutions each quarter. Over the last six months, approximately $625 million of criticized balances were resolved through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades, which is nearly 80% of the beginning balance. The biggest decline came from the services portfolio which declined more than $130 million and about $100 million of which was favorable resolutions.","Looking at the problem loan metrics of the oil and gas portfolio, classified oil and gas loan balances decreased $44 million in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, a much improved performance compared to the prior quarter's deterioration. Total nonaccrual balances increased, with all of the increase coming from the services portfolio. As I've noted in the past, the vast majority of criticized, classified and even nonaccrual loans are still current on payments.","Turning to slide 19, regarding our loss expectations, assuming oil were to hold in the mid-$40s or higher, and natural gas similarly positioned favorably as well, we expect energy losses for the next four quarters to be somewhat less than in the past year. And that most of those losses will come from the services portfolio. The third quarter losses reflect the results also of the Shared National Credit exam both in terms of our loan quality and charge-off metrics that we've reported. Although the losses remain elevated, we have a strong reserve set aside against our oil and gas loans. The reserve is more than $200 million which represents more than 8% of outstanding balances.","On slide 20 is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to achieving a positive operating leverage and I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit, customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers, and improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages.","Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today. And we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier. Regarding return of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders.","Finally we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgement that our commitment to doing business locally really is a strategic differentiator is the industry-leading results we received again this year in a nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research.","With that, Paul, I'll turn the call back to you.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Thanks, Scott. I'll draw your attention to slide 22 (sic) [slide 21] which depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter.","We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the sort of mid-single digits. We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high-single digit growth rate, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. Although our efficiency target, looking forward into 2017 includes the assumption of one additional quarter rate point hike in December, we believe we can achieve our targeted growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target Fed funds rate.","Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of just over $15 million this quarter which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments. This was assisted by various net recoveries outside of the oil and gas portfolio. We do not believe that it is a sustainable level and thus, we believe the provision for credit losses will likely be more consistent with the level that we experienced in the first half of 2016, assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.","We expect that customer-related fees, which we define in our press release and which exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, will be stable from the level reported in the third quarter, which had been noted on the slide to include about $3 million of miscellaneous income that we don't consider likely to recur, at least on a sustainable basis.","We remain committed to achieving our goal of adjusted noninterest expense of less than $1.58 billion for 2016 which implies about $395 million or less in the fourth quarter. In the first half of 2017 we expect to experience the typical seasonal variation as was seen in the first half of 2016 with most of that variation occurring in the first quarter. Although we are striving to keep expenses low and stable, the outlook for the next four quarters is consistent with the initial goal outlined in June 2015 which called for a slight increase in 2017 relative to 2016.","We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% over the next four quarters and we expect preferred dividends to be between $40 million and $45 million over the next 12 months. And, as mentioned in my earlier remarks, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher cost preferred equity, although we do not expect that to have a material benefit to the forward four quarter outlook.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Candace, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. And our first question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR. Your line is now open.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. I just wanted to talk a little bit about commercial loan demand and, outside of energy, I know you guys said you were hoping it would be a little bit stronger although it was a big contributor in the quarter. Some of your peers have talked about softer demand in C&I lending. I'm just curious what you're seeing.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","I think that's consistent with what we saw during the third quarter. The third quarter has generally been a softer quarter. You get kind of the summer vacations and everything else baked into it, but this was softer than I think we would have expected. And so we'll see what happens through the remainder of the year. But it was a softer quarter in C&I than we would have hoped for.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","You'll notice, also, it was similar last year. We had the same period of softness last year.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. But it sounds like this is more than seasonal, is the sense you all have from customers.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Well, from the actual activity you've seen, I think that's probably the case. As we noted, you do have this other factor of oil and gas-related loans declining, which is pretty good headwind. I mean that was $250 million during the quarter, and so in a C&I portfolio that's pretty significant headwind.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Fair enough. And then just on the commercial loan yield, some of your peers saw a little bit of lift this quarter from the move in LIBOR, and it looks like your commercial loan yield wasn't up. I'm just kind of curious, any thoughts there about maybe why you didn't see a little more strength on that.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. This is Paul. We did not see a \u2013 as you know, the one month LIBOR changed a little bit. Three months LIBOR changed a little bit more. The change in one month LIBOR really wasn't that material, and the majority of our loans that are LIBOR-based are really based on that shorter part of the curve. So, I noted several items that contributed to the 5 basis points of margin compression related to fees and FDIC-related income. The change in LIBOR was not enough to offset those headwinds.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Good afternoon.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Hey, Brad.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, just wanted to follow up on the provision guidance. I appreciate the color there, but just curious kind of what's driving the increase maybe from this quarter. You guys still have one of the strongest reserves out there. A lot of the provisioning in the first half of the year was related to the oil and gas industry. It seems like, Scott, your comments around that are pretty positive in terms of kind of where the charge-offs are heading. Just kind of curious why that can't stay low, was that all a function of maybe the slightly higher loan growth that you guys are seeing coming down the pipe.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah a couple of comments, Brad. I think this quarter benefited by a pretty significant level of debt recoveries, generally in the C&I portfolio, and so that muted the provision to a certain degree. And I think also it's just very hard to project out four quarters, particularly as it relates to our energy services portfolio, number one.","Number two, we'll finish this year \u2013 well, let me just say it this way. Through nine months we're net recovered on 94% of our loan portfolio. So while we generally trend around 10 basis points to 12 basis points in net charge-offs per year over the last three or four years, we're running right now to net recovered positions. So I think our assumption is while we think we'll see improvement, we're optimistic on the oil and gas charge-off front. We do believe we should naturally see some charge-offs on the non-oil and gas piece.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Sure. And just one follow-up on the oil and gas piece, what price per oil and gas were you using in your slide decks these days, in your price decks for new credits, or as you review the book going forward?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. Generally, we're going to run somewhere around 90% of NYMEX on oil and on natural gas, and so our oil price tag starts in the low $40s and escalates about $5, $6 over a six-year period of time. Natural gas, there's been quite a run up in natural gas right now and we're probably a little less than 90% in terms of NYMEX on the natural gas price tag we're using.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Hey, John.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Back to the commercial loan growth, just wanted to get if you have any early indications at all around how growth is coming out so far in the fourth quarter or if you've seen a little bit of a turn in that sluggishness? And then also, what C&I growth rate is needed to meet your mid single digit growth guidance? What's baked in there in terms of C&I growth? Thanks.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Well I guess I'd say, in terms of loan growth, I mean we kind of got a report card every Monday morning and last week I was discouraged and this morning I was encouraged. And it'll probably seesaw back and forth. I think it's still a little early in the quarter to make much sense of it.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","And in terms of loan growth rates in general, it's sort of a 5% to 7% growth rate for C&I. The CRE portfolio we're projecting to kind of grow in the 4% to 5% growth rate range. Even though it's softened in the recent quarters, we are still anticipating growing that. And then we are seeing nice increases on the consumer side this year principally through our mortgage related products. The C&I growth rate is very consistent with the mid-single digit growth rate we need for the entire portfolio.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Got it. And Scott, on that CRE comment you made, does that include owner occupied or do you include that in the commercial when you say that?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","No. Owner occupied is part of C&I.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay good. All right. And then secondly, just wanted to ask around the energy reserve, as you see these reserve releases materializing, if you don't see a material change in other areas of the loan portfolio, would you expect that there's going to be outright releases or do you think there's a likelihood of reallocation. And then, secondarily, where was your loan loss reserve for energy before we saw the slide in oil prices a little while back? Thanks.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","I don't recall exactly where. Our energy reserve was probably not too different than our total reserve, so it would have been around 1.6%, 1.5% going into the downturn. Now, it's at 8%. I tried to provide in my remarks a little bit of a multi-year reconciliation of that. And the guidance that Paul was providing around provision for the entire company really would lead you to believe that we would see moderate releases in that energy reserve.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, this is Paul. I'd just add on as a reminder the energy reserve is over 8% and, in fact, this quarter, on a dollar basis, there was a little bit of release in energy. But because the decline in the portfolio outpaced that, the energy reserve on the portfolio remains at over 8%.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Got it. All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. Just in terms of the margin, actually the cash that you guys have the redeployment from cash and money market into securities, can you just remind us how much more of cash or money market do you actually have that is easily switchable into securities from here?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Well, I'm going to change your question around a little bit if I could. You say easily switchable. We've got an enormous amount of on-balance sheet liquidity and off-balance sheet liquidity, right? So our cash position is a couple of billion dollars and so, certainly, we would be looking to redeploy that. But I would just remind everybody that we do have a lot of liquidity in addition to just on the cash balance sheet that could allow us to continue purchasing through this year and as we get into 2017.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, and I guess I was just trying to separate out the cash that you want to keep in cash versus the cash you that you've clearly identified as going into securities over, say, the next couple quarters. And, if I heard you right, it was a couple billion? So $2 billion? Is that fair or?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","No, I wouldn't say that. Sorry if I wasn't clear. The amount of cash you need to hold on the balance sheet is not a big number although it's probably going to be in the hundreds of millions, and maybe a billion dollars. The fact of the matter is, is that the securities we're buying are so liquid that it really minimizes the need for on-balance sheet cash. If that gets to your question?","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Maybe a slightly different question, just you mentioned the premium amortization was a component of the NIM compression. Is that something that, now that we're at a lower level, NIM should remain at that lower level? Or is there any part of premium amortization next quarter cause some pop upwards in the margin?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, the premium amortization is due to prepayments on the portfolio as you know, and there are kind of two big chunky parts of the portfolio. One related to our SBA bonds, and the other related to our mortgage-backed securities. Incidentally they're both impacted by kind of different macro factors. I will say that the primary factor this time was accelerated prepayments on mortgages. And so you can look at kind of the Refi Index as probably an indication of where that amortization is going. And so what we saw was increased amortization due to increased prepayments on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio.","To the extent the yield curve steepens, my expectation would be that those prepayments would slow down and you would see a corresponding impact on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. I would also note that there are a lot of macro impacts related to the \"Brexit\" that appeared to have slowed prepayments down as we have moved into October.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jill Shea of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good evening. Maybe could you just touch on the guidance around NII and the ability to attain the mid-to-high single-digit growth even without a December rate hike? Can you just speak to the confidence there? Is it NIM stability, is it loan growth or is it the cash deployment into the securities book? Maybe just dig into that guidance and how we should think about the outlook for the NIM going forward.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, sure. This is Paul. It's kind of a combination of all those things. As a reminder, we would expect net interest income to be over 12 months positively impacted by about kind of $25 million to $30 million for every 25 basis point rate increase. But the big mover, as we've seen over the course of the last year, and you saw this in our PPNR, which Harris noted was up over 20% over the course of last year, a lot of that is related to improvements in net interest income.","And a lot of that is related to kind of our ability to maintain coupon on the loan book, and while we're growing the loan portfolio, and then deploying cash and liquidity into the investment portfolio kind of moving out of assets earning 25 basis points to earning closer to kind of 1.25% to 1.50% (37:39) or more potentially. But also importantly to the extent we're deploying kind of off balance sheet liquidity it continues to lever our capital which we would expect to continue to grow net interest income. So we feel pretty good about our ability to grow loans, maintain margins and as you know redeploy cash in the investment portfolio.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","And Jill, this is James. I might just jump in and mention that on as we look at the book of business, particularly on the commercial loan side, as we look out over the next several quarters, the loans that are maturing have a coupon that is very similar to the loans that we're producing so we're not seeing a lot of compression. As a total book of business the coupon on our loan portfolio only declined 1 basis point and so you see in the GAAP yield table that the yield on the loan portfolio declined 5 basis points. Only one out of the 5 basis points was due to the coupon declining. The rest of it was due to the changes in the way that fees are amortized on that book of business in the FDIC and so forth. So we're really not seeing a lot of compression on the margin side. So Paul talked to the volume side and the margin is probably relatively stable.","Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's really helpful. And then just in turn, I think you already touched on some of the securities portfolio adds but you noted in the slide that you're not necessarily limited by the cash currently on the balance sheet. Can you just walk us through how you think about the size of the securities book? Is it a percentage of earning assets? How should we think about the potential securities build over time?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. The securities portfolio exists first and foremost as a source of liquidity for the balance sheet. And historically we've held a lot of cash for that purpose and now as noted we're deploying that into investment securities, highly liquid HQLA if you will, highly liquid assets as defined by the LCR, in order to maintain what is a very strong position as it relates to the LCR.","Looking ahead, we use the investment portfolio again primarily for liquidity but also to manage interest rate risk. And as we think about our interest rate risk positioning over time, I think you had seen us slowly decrease that. That is our asset sensitivity so that process may continue and so that's kind of a secondary use if you will. The investment portfolio is a mechanism to add duration to the balance sheet that helps to balance kind of the very short term, short duration assets we have with the relatively longer duration liabilities.","So it's really those two components that drive the size and composition of the investment portfolio.","Jill Shea - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our question comes from David Eads of UBS. Your line is now open.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. Maybe just kind of touching on this balance sheet theme, you saw a really nice increase in noninterest bearing deposit and deposits in general seem like they're up pretty solidly. I guess, anything unusual going on there and in the event deposit growth exceeds loan growth that most of that will end up being deployed in securities?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","My expectation would not be that deposit growth exceeds loan growth, certainly over the medium term. In the near term, as noted, we're deploying our balance sheet liquidity into securities and so to the extent to your question if that were to happen, it would probably affect the types of products that we're buying on the asset side because of the kind of relative nature perhaps or length of time we might expect to hold those securities. But certainly, I would see us continuing to deploy that excess cash into securities.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","David, it's Scott. The growth in demand deposit is principally a function of just our business banking orientation and our industry leading treasury management products. And generally there will be some ebbs and flows in that, but you'll generally see growth in demand deposits in the second half of the year kind of from the late summer through the end of the year, would be a seasonal occurrence that we would expect.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. And then, in the kind of geographic loan growth chart, I see that if you look at the C&I ex-energy, the biggest negative growth market was in energy. I'm just kind of curious whether you would characterize that as just kind of the same typical just slowing demand. Or was there anything different going on in Texas this quarter?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","This is Scott. That's where you would see this principally the majority of this $250 million of energy paydowns.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","I was talking about the ex-energy, the $86 million of negative growth.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Oh, excuse me. Yes, I wouldn't really comment much on that other than the economy has obviously slowed in Texas, particularly in Houston. And I really should be careful to say it really has not slowed at all in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Their job growth is very strong where we have a bank. There's solid growth in San Antonio, the economy there where we have a bank. But Houston, particularly, you're seeing activity level decrease across the board, and so my guess is that the fundamental driver of those lower non-energy C&I outstandings.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","And David, this is James. I'll just comment, I'm familiar with some payoffs due to some merger activity, so we don't do a tremendous amount of leverage buy out financing, and so some of our middle market companies were purchased during the quarter. And that accelerated some of the payoff rates.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Everybody.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Hello.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So the company made nice progress over the past year in growing PPNR, that's pretty clear. With a guidance calling for a slight increase in expenses in 2017, what are your thoughts on a more aggressive cost containment program in 2017? Maybe something similar to what we saw out of Comerica?","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Well, I expect that you'll continue to see progress in terms of head count and I mean we're continuing to identify opportunities. We're doing a lot of work in terms of process in back office. I think for us and probably for the industry that the pace of branch closures probably slows, though it won't stop. For us, we've been at this now for several quarters. We're not likely to bring in a lot of consultants to try and figure out refresh what we're going to do next. I think we've got a pretty good game plan.","I would note, I'd just remind everyone, that we're doing something that nobody else in the industry is doing, and that is we're in the process of replacing all of our core processing systems. We think that that's actually a really important kind of long-term investment to be making in a digital age that we're in. It cost us about $35 million this year and about the same next year.","I think when we come out the other end of this, which is still it's kind of three years away, but I do expect that's going to create a much simpler back office in this place. And that's where the real opportunity is and so we're really focused on doing things that aren't just very short term but really reinvent how we do business, starting with systems. And so I don't envision changing course but I think we're going to continue to make pretty good progress. And, like I said, I think expenses are going to be pretty flat, but you have to run pretty hard to keep flat because you have, I mean cost of labor is starting to increase. We're seeing increases here and there and, like I said, a lot of systems work going on. So I think we can keep expenses flat, that'll actually be a pretty good achievement.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that perspective. Maybe just a second one for Scott, if we look at the $256 million reduction in energy loans in the quarter, how did that split between performing loans and distressed credits. Thanks.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Steven, I don't have that number right in front of me.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","My recollection, if I could jump in, Scott, was that the composition was pretty similar to the remaining portfolio, but we could verify that.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. There wasn't anything particularly unusual, although there was a significant positive impact we had in problem credits. So one way to think about that is recall that our oilfield service portfolio, which has outstandings of about $500 million \u2013 that, that portfolio is going to amortize about $100 million a year even in a difficult environment, and we're seeing that because most of \u2013 as I noted, 90% of our energy credits are performing as agreed regardless of how we have them classified.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Then maybe I could ask this way. Are you seeing some of your more distressed credits get access to the capital markets and use those proceeds to pay you guys down?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Yes. The answer to that question is most certainly. I sort of vaguely referenced it earlier, but we had about $200 million of new either private equity injections or capital markets injections into our oil and gas portfolio companies. That was the largest quarterly increase that we had seen. That number is about $450 million now since January 1 of 2015.","So $200 million in a quarter is very significant, and I'd say about 40% of that number came from capital markets activities. 50% to 60% came from private equity injections. And we've seen that private equity phenomenon all throughout the downturn, but the public markets have opened to back up to a certain degree.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Hi, Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Just one more question on the securities portfolio. Paul, you mentioned a year ago that you'd find about $6 billion or so. It looks like you've already kind of gotten to that point, and you're still growing at about $1 billion a quarter. So is that the kind of pace that we should be expecting to see the book grow? And is there any stopping point where you get to that right level of the book with a combination of securities and you add this on the swap side?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","The answer to that is yes, there is a stopping point and we're not there yet. So to your point we outlined, initially, we outlined a plan to move cash into the investment portfolio. As we've done that I think we recognized the benefits of that and so we're continuing to work on that position, if you will. Ultimately, kind of the \"stopping point\" would most likely be defined by kind of our target asset sensitivity and with a minimum required on balance sheet liquidity in the form of high quality liquid assets. And so perhaps as we move through time we'll be able to give kind of a more search and outlook around that but I think for the time being your point is a good one, which is we've kind of achieved what we said we were going to achieve and we're continuing on the path.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And we saw that with your FHLBs up as well so I guess is that how should we assume it would be largely funded if loans are growing the same pace as deposits.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Well, I think what you saw, you're talking about the quarter-end number, had some modest increase in FHLB borrowings. Is that what you're referring to?","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yeah.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. Those were actually relatively short-term and they were there to take advantage of a kind of very short-term, I'll say, anomaly in the capital markets that were related to money market reform that allowed us to kind of pocket a little extra money there at quarter end. So those are not long-term borrowings but I will say that over time as we move through cash over time I would expect us to access the Federal Home Loan Bank system in sort of the normal course of business.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just one quick one on ROE, it got close to 8% this quarter on ROTCE. You've talked about a desire to get to double digits. You mentioned previously that you think you could get there with rates in 2017. Can you get there without rates in 2017? And if not, is it possible in 2018?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Well, look, is it possible? Certainly. But I would say that we'll be in a position I think to provide kind of a better kind of outlook and guidance as we get to the December earnings call in January. So there are a lot of things that go into that measure. As you know, we're really focused right now on improvement to the efficiency ratio and we're going to continue to be focused on that. Ultimately, an improved efficiency ratio should drive better balance sheet returns, should lead to better ROE. We're also very focused on through the CCAR process, managing our capital more effectively. And because there are two components to that, we kind of control the numerator. The denominator is subject to the kind of regulatory CCAR process. It's hard for us to provide a lot of clarity and guidance on precisely when we're going to get there.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","And Ken, this is James. I just wanted to jump in on the outlook for double-digit returns on tangible common equity, I think what we've said was it was more of a 2018 aspirational goal as opposed to 2017. I would just modify the year there and tell you more to come on that.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks for the clarification James.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. I wanted to build on Steven's question earlier about the \u2013 as you're seeing the run-off in energy loans. The graphs that I was looking at is page 9, if you look at the criticized loans in oil and gas to your overall loans and classified to loans and nonperforming to loans, those are all trending much higher as percentages. But when you look at the actual numbers when you got back to page 18, I was surprised to see that the actual levels, or dollar amounts, went down. So it does seem like there may be more of an exodus of the performing loans versus what we're seeing in criticized or classified. So I just wanted to make sure we kind of focus back on that question again just to kind of reconcile those two pages.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Sure, Marty. Let me, I was actually going to bring us back to that. It's a fairly technical question, I have the information, but it wasn't totally committed to memory. We started the quarter at about $800 million in classified loans and ended the quarter a bit down from there, about $770 million in classified loans. We had about $220 million in what I would call very positive favorable reductions of classified loans either through payoffs, or paydowns. I'm not talking about charge-offs, okay, $220 million. That was one of our strongest quarters of positive resolutions.","But far more important than that is that the inflow of new classifieds or increase in existing classified oil and gas loans was the lowest inflow, the smallest inflow that we've had since the middle of 2015. So if you want to think about it, we started out with about $800 million in classifieds with about 25% of those had positive resolutions and we were not replacing them as fast as they were running off, so.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And the net, if you look from $800 million to $770 million, you positively dealt with $220 million. That means that you had inflows of about $190 million, I guess. Is that about right?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","That's exactly right.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Okay. All right. So still about equal in a sense of what's leaving and what's coming back as you kind of go through that process. But yet still, like you said, improving from what you've seen before.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Paul, I want to ask you on the mortgage-backed securities, trying to reconcile again two things that seem a little bit contradictory. One is you have no extension whatsoever in duration when rates go up, but when rates come down you have cash flows and prepayments. I know you can buy some CMOs that are more one-sided in the sense they don't extend, but they do because they're in the early tranches, get paydowns. Is that what's driving that, is that there's that hard stop on the extension but yet you have the risk of the prepayments when rates go lower? Is that why that discrepancy is kind of coming out?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Marty, I guess the trick in our investment portfolio, the part of it that does look a little bit different is that we do have these SBA pools and the prepayments on those are not correlated to rate necessarily. So what we see is they are positively convexed instead of negative convexed. And so in our models as we run the rate shocks, what we're seeing is that, if you will, the positive convexity of the SBA pools and the negative convexity of the MBS roughly offset each other, which is why you don't see the extension risk in the plus 200 basis points rate environment as disclosed. Does that help?","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","So the netting of that is why you don't get the extension, but on the short end, the mortgage-backed prepayment is what caused you the impact this quarter.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Well, again, the mortgage prepayments are related to changes in rate and the flattening curve.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Right.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, accelerated prepayments there. There was not a corresponding impact in the SBA pools.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Got you. All right, thanks.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Gary Peter Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to hit on the fee side for a second, I recall, I think it was this past year's Investor Day or possibly the one before, you talked a lot about bringing that fee income contribution up to, I think, 25% as sort of an intermediate term goal. Over the last year you've made some progress on bringing up obviously the customer fees, but the percentage hasn't changed much. I wonder if you could update kind of what you're thinking there given the relative moves of net interest income versus fees.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Sure, thank you, Gary. This is Scott. First of all, the fee income ratio with the pace of which net interest income is growing because of loan growth and the repositioning of cash, I don't think you're going to see us make a lot of progress in terms of that ratio, just the pure math of it, because we're trying to grow our customer fees in the kind of mid-single digit rate 5% to 7% range. And net interest income is growing at a faster rate and may continue to, based on the guidance we've provided. So I think the more important number we're focused on is just the absolute dollar amount of customer related fees and total fee income and how that's accretive to earnings.","So and that number is again very nicely a little bit stronger than we would've expected so \u2013 and it's across the board which is really important. It's in our work horse fee income item is treasury management. It's about 30% of our $500 million in fee income. It's growing very nicely on a linked quarter year-over-year basis as well as year-to-date. Our credit card income is growing nicely. Wealth management, we basically had two wealth management platforms. We had two of virtually everything. We have now gone through the organizational process of creating one business and it's terrific to see that business growing. The insurance component of that business has been a leader for us as well as just our core investment management business.","So good solid progress in wealth management after making a lot of tough decisions there. Mortgage as we've noted is up. Foreign exchange, a nice business for us, is up. Really we're seeing good solid progress across the entire fee income spectrum.","Gary Peter Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co.","All right, Scott. Thanks for the color.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","And, Candace, this is James. We'll take one more question here. I believe we have \u2013 it's John Moran from Macquarie. We'll go ahead and take John's question and then we're out of time. So, John, go ahead with your question.","John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey. How's it going? Can you hear me?","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. We can. Thanks, John.","John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. Yeah. Okay. So, hey, I appreciate the detail you guys I think called out some healthcare and professional fees in legal on OpEx. The other line ran heavy this quarter. I just wondered if you could explain what was going in there and kind of what the outlook would be there for that line.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","John, this is Paul. A big chunk of that was really that legal accrual that I discussed. I think the key, as you think about expenses, I think the key is what we published on slide 21 of the investor deck which just says that we would expect noninterest expense for the next four quarters to be roughly stable with what we experienced in the third quarter 2016.","John Moran - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got you. Thanks.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Good.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","I think I'll just turn the time back over to Harris for some closing comments and we appreciate you joining the call today.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, thank you very much. We will look forward to talking to all of you next quarter and the couple of conferences in between. Overall I think we feel quite good about the quarter and the direction things are headed. If we see a little better loan growth that'll obviously help us and others around the industry, if we see a little better loan demand. But all in all, we're really pleased with the year that's starting to come to a close, and we appreciate all of your support.

Welcome to Zions Bancorporation's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. We will have a question-and-answer session later and the instructions will be given at that time.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Carmen. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2017 first quarter earnings. To begin, we will hear prepared remarks from Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer. We are also joined by Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer, as well as other Zions executives who are available to address your questions during the question-and-answer session.","I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this doc reconciliation.","We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour. During the question-and-answer section of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable all the participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Thank you very much James and welcome to all of you today to our call to discuss our first quarter results. I'm going to go to the slides that accompany the earnings release on slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. I would characterize the quarter as a healthy performance in terms of deposit growth and containment of the cost of deposits and credit performance with the exception of one large loan that I'll discuss more in a few minutes. At the same time, we're not entirely satisfied with total loan growth although we did outperform the industry relative to the December level. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.","On slide 4, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue reflects steady improvement, up 17% year-over-year, the result of both solid net interest income growth which increased 8% over the first quarter a year ago, and expense controls that limited adjusted noninterest expense growth to 3.8%. Much of the improvement in the net interest income came from the growth of income from the securities portfolio, as we worked to trim our asset sensitivity in exchange for more income today, while simultaneously reducing risk. Looking forward, we expect that interest income on loans will shoulder more of the burden of growth for 2017 and beyond. Year-over-year, GAAP noninterest expense increased 4.5%, while adjusted noninterest expense increased a lesser 3.8%. I'm encouraged that salary and benefits excluding severance only increased about 1% over the year ago period. Outside of our direct control, we experienced a more than 70% increase in deposit insurance costs as the FDIC instituted a surcharge to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund.","Turning to slide 5, we posted an efficiency ratio of 65.9% in the first quarter, declining 2.6 percentage points from 68.5% in the year ago period. Of note, because of seasonal factors in both revenue and expense, we believe it's more appropriate to compare the efficiency ratio to the year ago quarter. Our goal for 2017 is to achieve an efficiency ratio in the low-60s, while holding adjusted noninterest expense growth to between 2% and 3% from the 2016 actual result of $1.580 billion. I'd also note that we're achieving all of this while making some relatively substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects. We'll continue to work hard beyond 2017 to identify additional opportunities to become more efficient.","Moving to slide 6, similar to the industry, we experienced soft loan growth in the first quarter. Although on a more encouraging note, we've already surpassed total first quarter loan growth in the first three weeks of the second quarter. One of the strengths this past quarter has been in the 1-4 family loan area, which experienced a 23% increase in originations over the prior year and is fairly heavily skewed to purchase activity rather than refinancing volume.","During the first quarter of this year, we purchased $166 million of residential loans, which we may occasionally do if the opportunity presents itself and if it fits within our basic balance sheet management strategies.","Regarding borrower optimism, I would say that we are generally hearing more optimism across our entire customer base. Although much of this is anecdotal, one data point that bears noting would be our Nevada affiliate's recently completed annual survey of small business customers. In the past three years, only about 40% of Nevada business owners felt that the national economy was headed in the right direction. In our 2017 survey, that number jumped to nearly 70%.","Nevada businesses who plan to increase their employee base rose to 36% from 27% in last year's survey and more businesses expect to apply for a loan over the next 12 months than in the past. Although that is just one of our markets, it has been one of the more challenged markets for the past decade and we are optimistic about the future there and across our footprint.","Turning to deposit activity, although we generally experience volatility of deposit balances near quarter-end, the average deposit balance was stable when compared to the December quarter, and increased more than 5% from the year ago period.","Slide 7 depicts the credit quality metrics of our loan portfolio. We're encouraged with the decline in classified loans and general stability in nonperforming assets. Net charge-offs increased slightly as a result of a single loan that was charged off. During the quarter as described in the earnings release, one of our commercial loan customers experienced rapid deterioration in its financial condition when it became subject to a governmental investigation. That investigation resulted in the seizure of some of its assets. Because of the uncertainty of the situation, we charged off the entire balance of approximately $30 million. That amount equaled nearly 2\/3 of our net charge-offs recognized in first quarter.","We expect to pursue legal action to work towards a recovery, although no such recovery can be assured. At December 31, 2016, because of the financial condition of the company at that time, we had a very minimal allowance for credit loss on this particular relationship. And as a result of the events I just described, most of the provision for loan losses in the first quarter can be ascribed to this situation. Because of the nature of the situation, we cannot comment further on it.","Over the past couple of years, we've broken out credit quality metrics for oil and gas loans from non-oil and gas and we still do that in the appendix for those of you who are still interested. However, we are getting fewer and fewer questions about the oil and gas portfolio. We're increasingly confident about the credit performance of the oil and gas portfolio.","Let me cite a few statistics. Number one, our oil and gas companies were able to raise a combined $1.1 billion of equity during the first quarter, roughly double that of the prior quarter. Number two would be that although still below the historical peak, the oil and gas rig count in the U.S. has increased more than 90% from the year ago level, which is a substantial benefit to our companies and particularly our service companies. Number three, several of our exploration and production companies are expecting the services companies to increase prices in 2017 and they're already seeing an increase in prices in certain subsectors of the services industry.","And finally, our expectations for credit loss on oil and gas has improved materially in the past three months. Excluding the charge-offs from oil and gas of $14 million and the one credit that became subject to the government investigation that I mentioned, our net charge-offs remained very, very low. Currently, we don't see any systemic or emerging theme that may cause problem loans or loan losses to increase. Finally, we remain disciplined on our concentration limits.","Turning to slide 8, I'll highlight the improvement of two key profitability metrics, return on assets and return on average tangible common equity over the past few quarters. Return on assets increased to 88 basis points in the first quarter, up from 62 basis points a year ago. Average return on average tangible common equity increased to 8.8% from 5.6% a year ago. We're encouraged by the continued improvement and remain focused on achieving highly competitive returns on our balance sheet relative to peers.","With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to further review the financial results. Paul?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 9. For the first quarter of 2017, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $129 million, or $0.61 per share, up from $0.38 per share in the year ago period. There are some items within this quarter that are lumpy including securities gains and dividends primarily from Small Business Investment Company investments adding to about $7 million in the quarter, severance expense of about $5 million, and income tax benefits that include a one-time adjustments to state taxes of about $14 million in addition to a $4 million benefit from the tax \u2013 in the tax line related to the new stock-based compensation accounting guidance.","We've adjusted pre-provision net revenue. We've highlighted adjusted pre-provision net revenue which increased 17% from the year ago period, as Harris discussed earlier, although it dipped slightly from the prior quarter primarily due to seasonal factors. The last item highlighted on this page is the efficiency ratio, which as Harris has already discussed in detail.","Let me make a few comments about revenue first, about three quarters of our revenue comes from net interest income primarily driven by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer related deposit funding.","Slide 10 depicts the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 8%. I'll highlight the key volume drivers of this revenue item first and then discuss the rate component. The most significant factor in the year-over-year increase in net interest income is the $7 billion period end balance and $6.2 billion average balance, increase in investment securities.","If you'll turn to slide 12 (sic) [slide 11], as we suggested at our January report, we continued to purchase high-quality liquid securities during the first quarter, increasing period end securities portfolio by $2.1 billion and average securities by $2.5 billion, versus the prior quarter. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk. As discussed in previous reports, the mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about four years with a duration extension risk about half-a-year, if rates were to rise 200 basis points. The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including floating rate SBA securities is about 3.2 years today.","If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree, which is attributable to our discipline in purchasing mortgage-backed securities with limited duration extension risk, and because the floating rate Small Business Administration securities held in our portfolio are expected to prepay at a faster rate as the economy strengthens and rate rise, thus, serving as a counterbalance to the mortgage-backed security prepayment risk.","We expect the growth rate of interest income from securities to decelerate as we move through 2017, although we expect the second quarter's growth to remain somewhat strong. As observed in the tables in the earnings release, the period end securities balance is about $1.5 billion more than the first quarter average balance. So, we should expect an increase in net interest income related to the investment portfolio in the second quarter. We expect relatively stable period end securities balances over the near-term.","The other major component of earning asset volume is of course the loan portfolio. And slide 12 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year ago period. The size of the circles represent the relative size of loan portfolios. We experienced 3% growth in non-oil and gas commercial and industrial loans. Owner occupied loans increased nearly 3% and have experienced an improving trend after being relatively stable during the past two years.","As we have discussed in previous calls and at investor presentations, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward and in fact CRE declined in both the first quarter of 2017 and in the prior quarters. The primary driver of the decline is our commitment \u2013 the primary driver of the decline is our commitment to manage our portfolio concentration limits as Harris mentioned earlier.","We continue to experience a reduction in oil and gas loans of nearly $100 million in part due to merger activity, recapitalization and re-margining activity, and to a modest extent, loan losses. We achieved a 14% year-over-year growth in 1-4 family mortgage including some loan purchases as previously described and a 9% growth in home equity loans, which is consistent with our desire for stronger growth in these portfolios.","Looking ahead, we expect non-oil and gas, commercial and industrial, and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the National Real Estate portfolio and in the oil and gas portfolio although we expect a decline in 2017 for both portfolios to be less than that we experienced in 2016.","Turning to the rate component of net interest income, which is on slide 13. We break down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which increased 3 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.14%. There were a handful of items that limited the natural expansion of loan yields during the quarter including reduced income from loans purchased from the FDIC and lower prepayment penalty income relative to the prior quarter.","On the bottom right portion of the page is a table of interest rate characteristics of the portfolio. You'll notice that about 40% of portfolio, net of forwards and swaps, floats with prime and one month LIBOR. As a reminder, the key drivers of our asset sensitivity are the immediate benefit from floating rate loans, some additional benefit from loans that reset later in the year and limited duration extension risk in the securities portfolio, largely funded by low cost transaction-oriented client deposits.","The securities portfolio yield increased significantly this quarter. Most of the change is attributable to reduced premium amortization as compared to the prior quarter, due largely to higher interest rates.","Our cost of deposits did not change relative to the prior quarter. While we are monitoring the competitive landscape and will act accordingly, we currently expect deposit costs to remain fairly stable over the near-term. Additionally, the change in the composition of average earning assets dampened the net interest margin expansion by a few basis points when compared to the prior quarter.","On slide 14, there is an update to our interest rate sensitivity, which is not substantially different than the prior quarter, but has been reduced a fair amount from the year ago period. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25 basis point increase across the yield curve, after year of seasoning, would produce approximately $15 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the size and composition of the balance sheet. It will take a few quarters for the impact of a short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized, based upon the information provided on the prior slide.","Turning to slide 15 and on noninterest income, total noninterest income equaled $132 million, up from $117 million a year ago and up from $128 million in the prior quarter. The increase in the quarter was driven by an $8 million increase in net securities gains and an $8 million increase in dividends and other investment income primarily due to increased market values of the company's Small Business Investment Company investments. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in fair value in nonhedge derivative income of $7 million resulting from fair value adjustment.","Customer related fee income declined slightly from the prior quarter due in part to a decline in lending activity, partially offset by an increase in credit card and interchange fees. As we continue to focus on fee income, we are still targeting mid-single-digit annual growth for the full year 2017.","Noninterest expense, on slide 16, increased 4.5% from the prior quarter and if adjusted for items such as severance and other similar items, noninterest expense increased 3.8% from the year ago period.","During the quarter, we experienced annual seasonal compensation related expenses as detailed on the slide which explains most of the linked quarter variance. Also, as noted in the press release, we experienced a $3 million reduction in salary expense primarily related to loan origination. This was the result of an update in the estimation process associated with the consolidation of loan operations. This capitalized expense is expected to amortize over time through the net interest income. We are reaffirming our expectation that total adjusted noninterest expense will increase between 2% and 3% in 2017, when compared to the 2016 actual results.","On slide 17 is a list of our key objectives for the remainder of 2017 and 2018, and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to continuing to achieve positive operating leverage. With more than 17% year-over-year actual growth in pre-provision net revenue, our efforts continue to make a noticeable difference.","We remain committed to the substantial simplification of our operational processes. We also continue to work hard to upgrade our technology, which we expect will result in improved customer information infrastructure. When complete, this investment should simplify our back office, provide additional data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers, and better enable us to adopt enhanced digital capability.","Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today. And we are tracking toward those goals as discussed earlier.","Regarding returns of capital, we are pleased to have made progress in returning more capital to shareholders in the past year. Of note, we have repurchased nearly 4 million shares or nearly 2% of shares outstanding, since June 30, 2016. Although it is premature to give specific guidance on our expectations for the horizontal capital review process for 2017, the results of our internal stress testing indicate that we continue to have an opportunity to optimize our capital position in order to be more reflective of the company's manageable risks. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach.","Finally, slide 18 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which is to be interpreted as an annual growth rate in the mid-single digits. We expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next 12 months. This represents a deceleration from our prior outlook simply because we have largely completed the purchases of investment securities, as I mentioned earlier. No additional rate hikes are assumed in this outlook, although we do expect some further benefit from the March increase in the federal funds target rate. Additional increases in short-term rates are expected to improve net interest income.","Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a net provision for both funded loans and unfunded commitments of $18 million in the first quarter, largely due to the isolated charge-off discussed earlier, and partially offset by a decrease in the provision related to oil and gas portfolio. We are increasingly optimistic that the credit deterioration we experienced from the oil and gas portfolio has turned the corner. We expect that customer related fees, which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase moderately from the level reported in the first quarter.","We currently expect adjusted noninterest expenses to increase in 2017 between 2% and 3% relative to the 2016 reported results. Excluding adjustments for state taxes and the new accounting guidance for stock-based compensation discussed earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to remain in the 34% to 35% range for 2017, barring any meaningful changes in the tax code.","We expect preferred dividends to be approximately $37 million in 2017. And as mentioned in my remarks earlier, we do anticipate redeeming $144 million of high cost preferred equity in the first half of 2017. Diluted shares, assuming the share price remains near current levels for the quarter, may decline 1% to 2% in the second quarter from the first quarter, due to both the share repurchases and a reduced impact from the outstanding warrants that we described in detail in the January report. Please see the appendix of the slides for further sensitivity on the warrant effect.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Carmen, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question is from the line of Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, good afternoon.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Hi, Brad.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Paul, just wanted to ask a question about the balance sheet, maybe specifically the bond portfolio and the overall size of it. What's kind of your biggest driver there? Is it the rate environment or do you look at it as a percentage of earning assets? It looked like this quarter you maybe added some leverage through some borrowings maybe to support the bond portfolio. Just curious, would you continue to do that if rates move further in your favor, or kind of what your thinking would be around kind of a larger bond book?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","The size of the portfolio, as we've discussed previously, the size of the portfolio has really been \u2013 and the increasing size of the portfolio has been based upon our need due to the change in liquidity rules and other things to maintain a permanent store of liquidity on the balance sheet. That's kind of primary.","Secondary is, the management of interest rate risk as you alluded to, and sort of converting possible income into certain income in the current period. So, all of those items have conspired to increase the size of the portfolio. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we do not expect, Brad, for the securities portfolio to increase really from the March 31 levels.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. Great. And then just one follow-up, maybe for Scott, I know all the energy metrics, they're moving the right way. But I did notice the ratio of non-current NPLs in the energy books slipped from maybe 86% to down to 73%. Do you read anything into that, anything to be concerned about there? Is that just kind of getting down to the \u2013 maybe the worst NPL that you got in that book, or any other trends you're seeing there that we should be concerned about? Thank you.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Thank you, Brad. Specifically no, I'm not worried about the decline in that ratio. It's actually still higher than that ratio for our entire portfolio. So, it was unusually high to start with, unusually favorable to start with, and the decline is not something we're concerned about. As Harris noted, and Paul as well, the fundamental conditions in the industry are improving. You can see that externally in the first quarter earnings releases of Schlumberger and Halliburton. Access to capital is really good both through public markets, sales, private equity firm interaction. And so we're going to continue to watch the portfolio very closely. But all the trends are really positive with the exception of the one statistical trend you noted and the fact that NPAs were up slightly, but we're seeing good solid improvement.","Bradley Jason Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. On the reduction in asset sensitivity, can you give us a sense of how much further you'd like to continue bringing that down?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Hey, Geoff. This is Paul. I'll take that. We have managed that down over time, and I think again over time, we will continue to see that decline. Although, I'll say that the pace is a little undefined and we'll be opportunistic based on what we see as kind of the shape of the curve and sort of the relative value. As mentioned, the securities portfolio isn't really going to grow from here, and so any incremental management of our balance sheet positioning, our interest rate risk positioning, will really be managed through the swaps portfolio. And as you know the curve is relatively flat today, but not to say that we won't continue to manage that down. But ultimately that's going to be an Alco discussion item and we haven't really provided a whole lot of guidance on the pace of continued reductions in asset sensitivity.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Thanks. And then just to follow-up on that, last quarter you talked about moving away from the fast and slow disclosures to something more consistent with what most peers are giving just kind of a single number, and then sensitivities around that. Where have you got to with that process?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, Jeff. Thank you for remembering that and for that question. We are \u2013 as you would imagine, any change like that requires a lot of model redevelopment and that requires a lot of data analytics and a lot of validation and other items. And so we have worked through that process almost entirely at this point. And so, I would expect to see that no later than the next quarterly disclosure.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is now open. Mr. Mosby, your line is open.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Good afternoon, can you hear me now?","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Yes.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yes, sir, Marty.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Perfect. I just want to do a little bit of ticking and time (30:32), because you do have a lot of pieces that you kind of threw in there. It seems like to me when you start off with the $0.61 and you take the security gains and the severance, they kind of offset each other. And then you start looking at the tax adjustments versus the bigger charge-off and you get a little bit of a net pull down of a couple of pennies, and then you start to add back the seasonal expenses as that starts to roll forward. So, what I'm looking at it and you're looking at the efficiency ratio improving from first quarter to second quarter, while you could look at the security gains and the tax adjustment isolated from the other pieces and think, well, maybe you need to round down in earnings, really when you kind of look to these moving pieces, you can see a step-up even from the reported number as you move into the second quarter, and just wanted to kind of get a feel for how you see those moving pieces all come together like that.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Hey, I'll start and look at my compatriots to kind of add some color. Marty, this is Paul. The \u2013 first of all as you know, there's a lot of focus on GAAP reporting and so, we just want to ensure that our investors understand the GAAP financials which is what we reported. As you said, there are a lot of moving parts, and for me personally, it would be I think hard for me to provide sort of an \u2013 a near-term quarterly outlook. As you know, our outlook is really more of a \u2013 kind of a 12-month nature. We try to provide all the pieces that will allow our investors to kind of look through and sort of decide what's important and what's not important on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And so I don't know that we can give a whole lot more guidance in addition to that.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","It just feels like that as you look at the reported number, if you do kind of take into account all those pieces that we talked about that there is the opportunity the step-up from here as further efficiencies and seasonality comes out in the next couple of quarters, because that efficiency ratio was 65% and you're low \u2013 going to the low-60s. That's a pretty big step-up in profitability just there.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. And so, we Marty this is Scott, we would anticipate though as has been indicated that we're going to \u2013 we're staying on track with our efficiency ratio objective in the low-60s and expense growth in the 2% to 3% range. So, there's a lot of \u2013 there are so many moving parts and I think we highlighted very specifically the expense difference between the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, a lot of that is very one-time oriented. The other \u2013 there are other changes too in areas like fee income where we had some, what I would describe as sort of one-time events in the first quarter of last year and then there's seasonality that you pickup in the first quarter too. And so there are a lot of moving parts and I think our messaging would be that we feel \u2013 continue to feel confident about the projections that we've given, the guidance that we've given about efficiency ratio and expenses.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And then Paul you mentioned that the securities portfolio would start to kind of stabilize. When we talked before you've talked about kind of now transitioning to a little bit more use of interest rate swaps as a balancing factor in the sense of asset sensitivity. So, do you feel like you're going to start transitioning there and start adding a little bit more in the swap book as you move forward?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Well, yeah Marty, clearly as I said, the securities portfolio we just don't expect to grow from here. So, to the extent the Asset Liability Management Committee here continues to manage our interest sensitivity down and my expectation is that will happen. But I'm kind of one of many votes, but my expectation is that over time we will continue to manage our asset sensitivity down and swaps are the next tool in the tool box after we've exhausted the use of the securities portfolio. So, kind of a squishy answer to your question Marty because we haven't provided a lot of guidance on that topic specifically. But I think generally the direction that you laid out is correct and the direction that we've discussed previously is correct. And that is, once the securities portfolio has been sort of fully bought out, we will look to the next tool in the tool box which is interest rate swaps as we think about continuing to manage down our interest sensitivity.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And just the impact of restructuring doesn't end with the portfolio. You have another tool that you'll be able to start using so, thanks for your answers, appreciate it.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. Thanks, Marty.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Hey, Dave.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Good afternoon.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Could you guys give some of the numbers behind the factors that put downward pressure on the loan yield this quarter? You mentioned the lower accretion, the lower prepays et cetera, any numbers you can give there?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Well, what I can say is, there's a lot of little things that kind of add up to something significant. There's the kind of the headwind of reduced kind of FDIC related contribution. That was probably a couple of basis points. We had kind of non-accrual related items, interest reversals that were also a couple of basis points, maybe 1 basis point on that, 1 to 2 basis points prepayments or maybe 1 basis point. So it's a bunch of little things, Dave, that kind of add up into that headwind that I tried to describe, which is why I didn't break it out more eloquently in my prepared remarks, because there's a bunch of dogs and cats in there.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. No, I appreciate the color. I'm just trying to get at basically where the loan yield can go from here with the March rate hike. It sounds like that can move decently higher versus the change that you saw in the first quarter, so just any thoughts there?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, Dave, that's why we've tried to provide \u2013 we've got some new color as you know, as I'm sure you've noted from slide 13 of the earning slides.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Where we're being a lot more specific around sort of the index and the timing of reprice.","So you can kind of take a look at that. The other thing I'll notice is or I'll note that we've got swaps and floors in there. The swaps portfolio relatively modest at I think it's $1.4 billion. We've also got some caps in there. A lot of those caps are actually at 100 basis points on LIBOR. So the next rate move, we expect most of those caps to no longer be in the money. So there's several factors that to your point, we expect with the next rate move to continue to be additive to net interest income and certainly as it relates to the March move, we have yet to see that fully priced through here in the first quarter.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And Paul, where are your new loan yields post the March hike in your securities reinvestment rates, can you just talk about those? Thanks.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","The securities reinvestment is probably 2.25ish, which hasn't changed a lot because the yield curve, as you know, has stayed fairly flat even if the short rates have come up. New loan yields are on the floating rate stuff will be a little bit higher. The fixed rate stuff just aren't going to change a lot because, as you know, the fixed rate \u2013 fixed rate part of the curve just hasn't changed much.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah, Dave this is...","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Would you say new loan yields are \u2013 go ahead. Sorry.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","This is James. I'll just add a little bit. The coupon of the portfolio of the loan production during the quarter was just on a touch under 4% for the quarter, and that's up about 15 basis points from the prior quarter. That's obviously not the production we had in the very last week of December \u2013 I'm sorry, the very last week of March. But it is \u2013 does give you some sense as to where we were for the quarter on average.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Would you say that just given the production today, that's above where the book's yield is on well the loan side, James?","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. It's \u2013 it is \u2013 well, the whole book yield is moving up because of the variable rate nature of the book.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","So, yeah, it's...","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","But the loan \u2013 average loan yield is 4.14% in the quarter, right.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","And so, the other thing to consider, Dave, is the kind of the composition of the portfolio, what's growing and what's not. So, residential mortgages for example have a lower overall rate than the total portfolio yield, so \u2013 and we are growing that. So I think you \u2013 there are several factors to consider, just thinking about trying to look forward at the loan yields.","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Great. Thanks guys.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Good afternoon.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Hi, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Back to the margin on the loan yield again, the \u2013 I know you mentioned, Paul, the 40% of your loans float with prime or LIBOR inclusive of your floors and everything. If you did ex the floors and swaps, what is that variable rate percentage? And then separately just wanted to see if you can kind of give us more of an overall thought process around where your margin, what type of trajectory you could expect this \u2013 through the end of the year?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Sure. I'll start with the first question. Again referring to slide 13, you can see, John, we've tried to break out so for example all prime and one month LIBOR floating rate loans are about 47% \u2013 or 47% of the portfolio. We showed the effect of hedges and floors there. That's what gets you down to the 41% or about 40% as I said in my remarks. So, that 47% I think is the number that you're looking for, which is sort of a 30-day reprice. When you add up all the pieces though and kind of go down the list, you've got two to three months LIBOR, 6 to 12 months LIBOR kind of all those pieces together and you can see there's kind of a 66% that's tied to those shorter-term indices.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And how did that gross number change quarter-to-quarter, that 46% number?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","It hasn't really changed a lot. I think what we've disclosed in the past, John, which is why we tried to provide some incremental disclosure this quarter, is more of the sort of what floats under a year and that gets us to that kind of 60% to 66% sort of number. That's the number that we've talked about, because for a long time rates just weren't changing, so it was kind of an academic exercise. Now that the target rate is changing with a little more frequency, we thought it important for investors to understand kind of where the key points were in the portfolio, as it relates to interest sensitivity, which is why we've provided this incremental breakout. So the short answer is, it hasn't really changed, but we're just trying to provide a little more detail to be a little more transparent as it relates to the floating rate nature of the portfolio.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thanks, Paul. And just as a follow-up on credit, the charge-off, I know you couldn't talk too much more about it. But could you just give us what sector, what industry it is? And then separately the inflows into non-accruals looked relatively elevated given that NPAs are up despite the big charge-offs, and what drove that?","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","It's a healthcare related credit. I don't know if Michael if you want to say anything more about it?","Michael P. Morris - Zions Bancorp.","Well, no. All I'd say is that, it's an isolated event. It's non-systemic we believe. And we don't believe that it represents or is reflective of any other adverse trend in healthcare, if that's helpful. And then on the NPAs, slight uptick in NPAs for the quarter, some positive things already in the works this quarter. So, no real concern around that uptick and no real specific industry to point to.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","I mean it was though a little bit more of an uptick when you consider the big charge-off though, right?","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. Although \u2013 it wasn't nonperforming at the end of December.","Unknown Speaker","Right.","Michael P. Morris - Zions Bancorp.","It was a performing loan at December, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. All right. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, everybody.","Unknown Speaker","Hey.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wanted to ask on expenses. If we look at the $411 million of adjusted expenses in the quarter and we think about the run rate for the second quarter, Paul, if I look at the three items you're calling out on slide 16, so the $7 million of stock-based comp, $6 million of payroll taxes, and then $4 million contribution to the 401(k)...","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...can you walk through how much of each of those should come out of the run rate in 2Q?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Well, the way I think about it is this, and this is kind of one way to think about it. But these are sort of annual expenses and so you've got sort of a full-year's effect have all shown up in the first quarter effectively. So these items, the reason we call them out specifically is that these are not items that we would expect to show up again in the second quarter.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","I think the math of it is basically if you take three quarters of that number and subtract it from $411 million, it gets you to where the run rate probably should be.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Right.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just one follow-up, many banks here are calling out a need to ramp their tech spend, and you guys have obviously invested very heavily in technology over the past few years. Are you, in your mind, ahead of the curve or do you also need to ramp your spending in tech here to think about digital...","Harris H. Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","I hope so.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...and some of these other things?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","I think we believe we're ahead of the curve. Because we're trying to address our core loan and deposit systems, which for literally almost every other bank in the United States are 25 to 30-year old systems. And it is a many year project to address both of those. And the primary pressure driving that is obviously the pace of technology change, but the onset of the digital \u2013 just the digital requirements of customers and everybody that we interact with. And so you fundamentally cannot take 20 to 30-year old core loan and deposit systems and adapt them to a digital world. You just \u2013 the money you would spend on middleware would be astounding. So we're trying to address the core problem. Cyber security is also another key driver of this, and I think the industry as a whole is driving hard in terms of technology spend around cyber. But almost all banks have put off this investment in core and we are well into that process right now.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's good color. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Guys, wondering if you could just talk a little bit about deposit pricing. It was obviously very stable and you didn't really have any change this quarter. But any competitive dynamics or just a notable sense of change in your client base?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Hey, Ken. It's Paul. I'll start and ask anyone else to sort of join in. I was at a conference \u2013 I spoke at a conference here in the last quarter, and we talked a lot about deposit pricing, and kind of how \u2013 my opinion is that the liquidity coverage rules are kind of defining (46:36) deposit value right now. And I think there we are starting to see that impact deposit pricing. So I'll just remind everyone on the call that our portfolio, deposit portfolio looks a lot different. It's very granular, it is commercially oriented. It is very sort of client-based and deep relationship-based deposits. And so, we are not seeing, and I'm not hearing of pressure on those deposits yet. So, we're keeping an eye on it, and we've got our ear to the rail as we think about that. But in fact, so far we're just not feeling a lot of pressure on deposit price.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then secondly, just wondering in terms of funding the securities purchases, you had a big increase in the short-term borrowings which you said you might use, but the cost of those borrowings actually went up a good amount off of a low base. Now that you're approaching more of a level set for the investment portfolio, do those borrowings level out? Because you're kind of paying a little bit more incrementally for the borrowings than you are getting, at least in this quarter incrementally on the securities.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","I don't think we're paying more on the borrowings than we're earning on the securities. The securities are yielding over 2% and the borrowings are I think around 80 if I remember correctly. I can pull it out if you want.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","I'm talking about sequentially. I'm talking about the delta, sorry, the delta between the two, not \u2013 you're right, of course there's a margin on them, but I meant the delta between your securities was up 20 basis points, but the borrowings was up 35 basis points.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","No problem.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Yeah. So, in order to really affect interest sensitivity, we basically need to invest long and borrow short, and that's kind of what you're seeing there. I mean, that's ultimately sort of the driver of the interest sensitivity change. And ultimately the net value or the net volume we have associated with that incremental funding, is just going to be heavily dependent on kind of loan and deposit growth. And that, as you know, is sort of the balancing mechanism, as is the investment portfolio. So as we move through time, as everyone has heard me say previously, deposits really drive the value of a banking franchise and so deposit \u2013 incrementally, deposit growth is going to largely drive the incremental need for funding clearly, as we think about loan growth increasing throughout the rest of the year.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","And so (49:11) deposit growth, that short-term funds will be affected. But I'll also remind you that we can also manage the investment portfolio as sort of a balancing factor also.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks, Paul.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. Actually, I had sort of a similar question, just on the $2.9 billion of short-term borrowings. So Paul, are you saying that this \u2013 that ultimately this gets replaced with core deposits as it grows or is this like just an intentional strategy to add \u2013 whatever it was $2 billion plus worth of short-term borrowings and maintain it on your balance sheet to make sure that your asset sensitivity stays low?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","I will characterize this as an intentional strategy. As a bank, and as you know, it is completely normal to be in sort of a net borrowed position. And so, we kind of \u2013 over time, we've had so many deposits that we haven't had that line item on our balance sheet in quite some time. I'm frankly very comfortable with the level of kind of that incremental wholesale borrowing of $3 billion on our balance sheet. I think it is totally normal and I'm completely comfortable with it. So I would characterize it as clearly intentional.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up, on the non-customer related fees, so the $17 million that you got this quarter. That, I guess, combined numbers has just been all over the place. Is there any right number that we should think about going forward, is any part of that sustainable or recurring or is that all just insanely volatile? Thanks.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","There is a lot of \u2013 there is volatility in that. As I laid out, what I tried to do in my prepared remarks were to talk about kind of some of the key items that were impacting that. And at the very beginning of my prepared remarks, you may recall I said securities gains and dividends, this is largely driven by the Small Business Investment Company investment, we're about to add at about $7 million this quarter.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","And I would just add, Ken, this is James, that it's \u2013 one of the major sources of volatility over the last several quarters, I think three quarters now, has been a singular investment, which is actually a publicly traded company at this point. And so, it's not Level 3 accounting. It is observed prices in the market, and it is an investment that we've been involved in for years. And so, that's unfortunately the stock market is volatile from time-to-time and it's just \u2013 we've just \u2013 you've just seen the result of that.","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","And I'll just say, since James brought it up, it is a publicly traded investment. And it's not our practice to kind of hold on to those for extended period of time. So, we are \u2013 this is again out of our SBIC portfolio. It blossomed into a publicly traded company, which is a great outcome. And now, we are kind of disposing of that investment as quickly as we can.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Your line is now open.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. There's been a ton of questions about kind of the nitty-gritty on NIM and NII and maybe just kind of circling back, I guess the overall arching theme that you guys are talking about is sort of mid-single-digit-ish NII growth for the four quarters ending 1Q 2018 versus 4Q quarter \u2013 four quarters ending 1Q 2017, correct? And when I, I guess, when I look at the details that 1Q 2017 was up about 8.5% year-over-year, it looks like there's a couple of tailwinds sequentially for NII in 2Q from the balance sheet growth led (53:10) securities at the average securities coming on and then some benefit from loan yield. So I guess the bottom line, is there opportunities for that mid single-digit guide to be conservative or are there headwinds that we should be aware of or is there anything we're missing there?","Paul E. Burdiss - Zions Bancorp.","I think the key tailwind or key opportunity there is increased or increased short-term interest rates. So to the extent that that as I said in that outlook really don't have any assumed additional tightenings, fed tightenings in there. So that's clearly an opportunity. The other kind of opportunity and headwind, I think, is \u2013 or potential headwind is loan growth. And ultimately we've got a loan growth outlook here that accompanies that net interest income outlook, and we fully intend to achieve the loan growth. And if it's better than we are expecting, then that could be helpful and vice versa. Scott, I don't know if you want to add to that.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","No, I agree with both of those points, and loan growth is really a key for us. We've said, we're going to keep the investment portfolio pretty stable at this point, and we started out a little soft on the loan growth side. But as you look at slide 12, as Paul noted when he talked about it, the fundamental areas of loan generation for us are growing and have the potential to grow at a faster rate. And we will hit the bottom of the oil and gas declines and National Real Estate declines. So that will taper at some point.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks. And maybe on that loan growth point, it looks like the \u2013 in the energy book, the unfinished equipment (54:55) went up, I think you mentioned it was related to the midstream part of the portfolio. And I just wanted to kind of get your updated thoughts on potentially taking on more energy loans, whether it would be kind of focused in the E&P and midstream space or a little bit more broad?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Good question. We will definitely see the portfolio grow again. We've been a long-standing leader in energy lending in the country and we'll continue to be that. The growth will primarily come on the reserve-based side and on midstream. And on the reserve-based side as well as in the services sector, you're going to see revolvers being utilized again. And so we think that'll have a positive impact as well there is new underwriting going on both in the midstream and in the reserve-based side.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is now open.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, hello there. Just given the positive commentary around energy trends, is it your expectation that as you go through the redetermination process that loan upgrades are likely which could result in additional reserve releases?","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","Well, we're just starting in \u2013 this is Scott, we're just starting into the spring redeterminations and I think it's going to be kind of a flattish experience to the fall redetermination. And I think more important than the redeterminations, I think the financial results of our reserve-based borrowers is improving at a steady pace, and you're seeing drilling pick up as a result of the \u2013 you see the rig count increasing. And so I think the fundamentals in reserve-based lending are going to improve and you'll see that benefit in the reserve-based side, and you will absolutely see it in the services sector.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Great.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","And also \u2013 and so as it relates to the reserve, we'll just have to watch charge-offs and the general credit parameters, but as we've said previously that reserve will continue to come down. Assuming characteristics \u2013 the industry characteristics stay as they are today or improve.","James Richard Abbott - Zions Bancorp.","I mean, I just \u2013 Bob, I'll just jump on here, this is James. One of the interesting factoids that I've found as I looked through some of the statistics this quarter on the services portfolio is that the rapid pace at which the services companies are returning to positive EBITDA and positive free cash flow. It's not to overstate it a little bit but 10 to 15 percentage points of the portfolio per quarter, not annualized, is how fast they're coming back into profitability.","So it is a nice trend and certainly that's one of the trends that's causing the capital markets to be very interested in supplying capital to these companies.","Scott J. McLean - Zions Bancorp.","I think the other thing that's important to note that, generally the outstandings on the services side are term loans and those term loans generally we're amortizing on a three to five year basis. Today, we have about $630 million in energy services outstandings. 15 months ago, that number was a bit over $1 billion. So the exposure is coming down rapidly and it will continue to decline just through natural amortization of the credits that we had.","Bob H. Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Simmons - Zions Bancorp.","Quarter-to-date, it's been C&I, and it's been consumer primarily, a little bit of commercial real estate, but not very much.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James R. Abbott","Good evening, and we welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2011 earnings. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information and which applies equally to statements made in this call.","We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will limit the length of the call to one hour which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?","H. H. Simmons","Thank you all very much for joining us this evening. We are overall quite pleased with the progress you saw this quarter on asset quality. And we expect continued improvement in the first quarter, particularly with respect to net charge-offs but also with other asset quality metrics. ","As you've seen in the release, our nonperforming assets declined 16%, and within that number, other real estate owned declined a strong 25%, so we're very pleased with that. Additionally, a favorable resolutions with nonaccrual loans such as payoffs and upgrades equaled 1.8x the number of unfavorable or the volume of unfavorable resolutions such as charge-offs.  A year ago, that ratio was 1.4x. ","Quarterly new inflows and declassified loans declined an additional 8% after declining an unusually strong 20% last quarter. Annualized, declassified loan inflows equaled $1.3 billion, which compares to the end-of-period balance of $2.1 billion. And we expect classified loans to continue to decline over at least the next few quarters. ","Our allowance for credit loss ratio to annualized net charge offs remains at one of the highest levels in the industry at 3 years, and this is despite a $95 million sequential quarter reduction in the allowance for current loss balance. ","Loan balances grew $427 million. However, we note that the average balance grew at a much more moderate pace of $113 million. Customers borrowed significantly in the latter weeks of the quarter and paid down about $200 million of these balances in the first week of January, so we're inclined to focus on the average balance growth. Nevertheless, the increase on average balances is an improvement from the prior quarter's modest decline of $56 million. ","The greatest challenge of the quarter is evident in the net interest income line, which declined by 1.8% compared with the prior quarter. The decline was caused by loan and pricing activity, due to both maturities of loans that were brought to several years ago at higher rates, as well as adjustable rate loans that reached reset dates. For these same reasons, we expect pressure on loan rates throughout 2012 and perhaps into 2013, depending on what happens with the yield curve. ","However, there are 2 positive developments that should help provide some support for net interest income during 2012: First, given a moderate strengthening in customer sentiment and stronger pipelines and continued production momentum, stronger loan growth in 2012 should support net interest income; secondly, loan pricing appears to be firming across most categories in loan sizes. Net, we believe that net interest income should be relatively stable during the next year. ","As we look into 2012, despite a challenging revenue environment, we do expect to see growth in earnings per share. Some of you look at earnings excluding reserve releases. With the continued improvement in asset quality, that number should rise in 2012, primarily driven by declines in net charge-offs. ","Finally, my remarks, I just want to point out that Zions is participating in the Federal Reserve Capital Plan Review 2012 process, and we timely submitted our capital plan, stress test results and related documentations required on January 9. While we feel comfortable with our submission and results, we consider that filing and the subsequent Federal Reserve review currently underway to be part of an ongoing regulatory process that won't be complete until we were in the outcome of the Federal Reserve review on March 15. Therefore, we will not comment or speculate on the outcome of that review prior to announcing them on or shortly after March 15. ","So with that brief overview, I'll ask our Chief Financial Officer and Vice Chairman, Doyle Arnold, to review the quarterly performance. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon, everyone. As first and few -- a little overview, as noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $44.4 million or $0.24 per diluted common share for the quarter. As we've done in the past, we also presented the earnings in a way that excludes the noncash impact of the sub debt amortization, when it converts into preferred, et cetera, and also the FDIC-assisted loan discount accretion. We think this adjusted number is useful to longer-term investors as we do not expect those income and expense items to be with us in perpetuity. On that basis, earnings were $0.30 a share, down from $0.40 per share last quarter. ","There were a number of significant items that occurred during the fourth quarter that are worth noting. Within noninterest income, we recorded $12 million of OTTI on securities this quarter, which included about $5 million of OTTI that was taken to adjust model default probabilities in the medium term, not the near term. We made those probabilities in years 2 through 5, a bit more conservative than they have been. ","I would note that our model has been particularly conservative lately in predicting near term or one-year default probabilities, so we didn't adjust those, and we continue to be predicting a bit more in the way of defaults than are actually occurring in the near term. ","Secondly, as we've previously discussed, the Durbin Amendment processed about $8 million. I believe our previous estimate had been $9 million but we currently estimate it was about $8 million in the quarter, and that is found in the Other Service Charges line item on the income statement. We do expect that service charges and deposit fees will increase somewhat as we move through 2012 and attempt to reevaluate some of our other pricing for services in the consumer and other space. ","Within noninterest income, there are a couple of things -- I'm sorry, noninterest expense, there are a couple of things worth noting. The salary and benefits line item, you'll note, increased overall by about $3 million. However, as we mentioned in the release, there was a $6 million expense related to employee benefits -- accrual for employee benefit expense that will not recur and actually related to a prior period. ","Legal and professional expense line item included about $3.5 million related to consulting and professional service expenses incurred in our capital plan and stress test preparation for the CCAR 2012 exercise. Because of our first official submission under the Dodd-Frank Act, we hired a couple of outside advisers and have consulted with previous participants to get their insight and expertise. And that again is an expense that we don't think will recur. Additional increases in this line were related primarily to seasonal increases and should decline somewhat in the first quarter. ","And in the other noninterest expense line, there was -- we accrued about $7 million for potential loss contingencies -- excuse me, for litigation extending from several legal matters, including several that are similar to those that have occurred at a number of other banks. Put that $7 million in perspective by comparison, we had accrued a total of $3 million for legal expenses through the first 3 quarters of 2011. And therefore, the full year total is about $10 million. ","As you can probably appreciate the timing of such accruals are somewhat episodic, and the dollar amount per situation can change from time to time so it's very hard to guide to a number for 2012. Also included in that line item, the other noninterest expense is the amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset which was about $13 million this quarter. ","Now I'd like to turn the page -- turn to credit and refer you to Page 12. And I'll add a couple of details to Harris' other comments where he'd indicated that we've had significant improvement in credit quality. If you'll note on the first line on Page 12, nonaccrual loans declined from $1,039,000,000 to $886 million or about a 15% decline. And then as Harris mentioned, the next line, other real estate owned, was down about 25%. ","Scanning on down the page, nonaccrual loans plus accruing loans past due 90 days or more were down from $1,169,000,000 to $1,004,000,000, so about a $165 million decline. The very last line, classified loans, came down by a bit over $300 million, similar to the pace of the prior quarter as we've continued to push aggressively to resolve problems. ","The one line that was a little more sticky is not on that page, it's, I don't believe, it's on another page that relates to the reserve. But net charge-offs were down but by a lower percentage. We do expect to see a somewhat larger drop in net charge-offs in the first quarter than they -- the kind of the gradual decline of about $10 million we've seen in the last couple of quarters, and we think there's a really good chance that, that number will be down significantly. ","Essentially throughout 2012, including the last couple of quarters, we were pushing very aggressively to resolve problem situations and got through a lot of those, and we'll continue to work down the problem loans but we think that the net charge-off number is likely to decline meaningfully in the first quarter compared to the third and fourth quarters of last year. ","The NPA, or nonperforming asset, resolution rate set a recent high at 31% at the beginning, NPA balances plus quarterly inflows. And of the more than $450 million of NPAs resolved, nearly 70% were resolved favorably such as through payoffs, paydowns or upgrades. Loss severity for the trailing 12 months generally continues to improve from about 10% of total classified loans to just a hair over 8% of classified loans. ","Construction, both residential and commercial and commercial real estate -- excuse me, construction and C&I business loan loss severity improved. Term commercial real estate loan severity was stable, and owner-occupied loan loss severity was slightly higher. But again, this was one of the areas that we're working particularly hard to address problems situations and work down classified assets. ","Turning now to some of the revenue drivers on Page 11, the preceding page. You'll see the change in loan balances by type. We experienced, on the first line, particularly strong growth in C&I loans, up about 6% sequentially or $607 million. As Harris mentioned, we did experience some attrition, a couple of hundred million in the first quarter in total loans. So it looks like there were some window dressing that may have gone on, on the part of some of these customers near quarter end. But based on what is -- as Harris mentioned were strong pipelines, we would expect some continued growth in this category in the first quarter. ","These new C&I loans are priced on average relatively neutral to our overall NIM, and to the extent we can fund these loans with existing cash, which is quite doable. The loan growth would be accretive -- will be quite accretive to the net interest margin. Importantly, pricing on our C&I production, new loans, had increased a few basis points over the prior couple of quarters, so the growth that we saw this last quarter didn't come as a result of any slackening of pricing discipline. ","And to answer a question that we've heard some analysts have been asking our peers regarding purchase loan activities, we're both a syndicator of loans and a buyer of syndicated loans, and the 2 more or less offset each other, not perfectly. But going to the bottom line, about 1\/3 of the company's linked quarter C&I loan growth was driven by an increase in our net syndicated loan portfolio, which means about 2\/3 of the growth was unrelated to syndications. ","If you go down a few lines on the commercial real estate, the construction and development portfolio declined about $200 million or 8% sequentially. $60 million of the decline was due to conversions into term CRE, and you can see the term CRE category, the next line, did grow modestly to $7.9 billion. So some but not all of the growth in term CRE is explained by completion of construction projects, and they had leased up and were rolled into [indiscernible]. A small $13 million of the decline in construction and development was due to net charge-offs, but the large majority either paid off or paid down during the quarter. ","New production and draws on construction and development lines continues to increase, was up for the fourth consecutive quarter. By way of a reminder, about 2\/3 of the construction and development portfolio is for commercial buildings, and most of the property types are experiencing healthy improvement in cap rates, moderate improvement in occupancy rates and generally stable effective rents. And those trends, of course, are supportive of credit quality and loan growth both in the C&D and term CRE portfolios. ","Turning to Page 15. We break out the major drivers of the net interest margin. We've detailed the major NIM changes in the release. But to summarize, deposit inflows remain quite strong during the quarter and were up on average $800 million -- in excess of $800 million. But anecdotally, if you flip back to Page 9, you can see the total period -- the quarter end to quarter end deposits grew by $1.5 billion, of which $1.2 billion was DDA and most of that was commercial. We saw the same year-end pattern in deposits as in loans, namely a strong run-up in the month of December in deposits, followed by a significant reversal in the first week of January. Significantly, it didn't reverse by any means all of that run-up but some hundreds of millions went out in the first week of January. So we, again, see indicators of some window dressing perhaps on the part of commercial customers. ","On the asset side, average loans, as Harris I think mentioned, increased $114 million. Average securities declined $471 million, driving an increase in average cash balances of more than $1 billion. The decline in securities was essentially the result of a decision to sell or runoff the $700 million of short-term treasuries that the parent company here owned and parked the money in cash, both were at very low yields, but and therefore it didn't materially affect the NIM. ","But the net result from the -- attributable to the increase in cash on the balance sheet was a decline in the NIM of approximately 8 basis points. Aside from that, the NIM declined an additional 5 basis points, which is attributable to 2 factors: First, adjustable-rate loan caps from loans originated several years earlier are resetting to lower rates as the repricing index is lower now than when those loans were booked. Secondly, maturing loans, many of which have rate floors, were replaced with new loans at lower coupons or lower floors compared to the loans originated when spreads were higher. We think the NIM will be under pressure for an extended period from those forces by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter as we look at the maturity and repricing schedule of the loans. However, it doesn't take too much loan growth at current pricing to offset that. So if and as loan growth strengthens and we're able to trade cash for loans and affect the pickup, the net interest income should offset this pricing pressure. ","And as Harris noted, we do -- it does seem to be the case that new loan pricing has roughly stabilized in recent months. ","Finally, our balance sheet does remain quite asset-sensitive, where an upward parallel shift in the yield curve of 200 basis points would result in an increase in net interest income of more than 10%. We, of course, are not forecasting an immediate parallel increase of 200 basis points, but that will give you an illustration of just how asset-sensitive we are. ","Shifting to a discussion of capital. GAAP tangible common equity ratio declined to 6.77% from 6.9%. That's entirely due to the buildup in deposits, which drove the buildup in cash balances. If the balance sheet size had simply remained static compared to the third quarter, the TCE ratio would have improved to about 7.0%. And we give you in the schedules attached to the released the regulatory capital ratios, which were relatively stable, Tier 1 common, we estimate at 9.55%, essentially unchanged versus 9.53% in the prior quarter. And we're estimating our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio fully phased in at roughly 7.9%. ","So that's kind of some -- it's the end of the quick tour through the balance sheet and income statement. In terms of what to expect in the coming quarter or a few quarters, we do expect continued improvement in credit quality, including significant reduction in net charge-offs in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. This should allow us to keep the provision very low. We look for net interest income to be relatively stable. We think OTTI should remain relatively low. We are not aware of any assumption changes at this point that we're likely to make that would affect that, and so far we have had no exposure to any bank failures so far this quarter. There'd only been 3, mostly very small ones nationwide, we had exposure to none. ","Noninterest operating expenses will be up a bit in the first quarter due to normal seasonal trends. Things like FICA, tax, everybody will be paying that in the first quarter. There'll also be a modest couple of million dollar increase, I believe, in pension costs for this year. But on the other hand, noninterest credit-related expenses should continue to decline as we go through the year. ","With that, operator, we will pause for a minute to let people log in for questions, and be pleased to start taking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Doyle, in your margin outlook that you provide, the 2 to 4 basis points per quarter, can you talk about the plans for the excess liquidity sitting on the balance sheet, the $8 billion that you had at the end of the quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, the plans for the $8 billion are not to do -- not to go out and buy a bunch of securities with it. And since it all results from customer deposits, we're not going to encourage customers to leave. So the likelihood and what we'd like to do is use that to fund what does appear to be some beginnings of a little greater loan demand and loan growth that we're seeing out there. But that, of course, will take time. But as we look around the other opportunities, we continue to price very, very low non-relationship CDs and other non-relationship deposit accounts, and to not have anything on the balance sheet that isn't core customer-related to the greatest extent possible. But we're not going to go out and buy mortgage-backed securities or very long dated treasuries at these historically extremely low interest rates and then get caught on the wrong side when the Fed, at some point, inevitably, will begin to tighten.","James R. Abbott","John, this is James. I would just comment, I've talked to a number of relationship managers across the company, that most of them are responding that the loan growth that they're seeing is a function of natural loan demand as opposed to just fighting and scrapping for market share at all costs. And so there is some natural organic demand and that's encouraging. So that will hopefully help draw down some of the cash balances.","Doyle L. Arnold","Okay. And then the other thing is these customers, a lot of this is commercial DDA buildup and if and as we're seeing gains or a bit of a recovery in the economy, we would expect some of those customers to start putting those balances to work in their companies as opposed to parking them in insured deposit accounts.","H. H. Simmons","I would just also add, the $8 billion figure, about $1 billion of that is really float. I mean, it's -- so there's a significant piece of that, that's actually just always going to be there for any bank. And the other thing I'd just add is that we do expect that there are going to be greater constraints on the ability to deploy cash. We're going to have to have higher liquidity standards going forward. And so some portion of that, I expect, will be more permanent than it's been in the past.","Doyle L. Arnold","I guess one final thing I forgot to note. We have about $1.4 billion that is earmarked one way or another to -- for TARP repayment. And so exiting TARP would reduce those cash balances by that amount, reduces total balance sheet size by that amount, and improve net earnings to common by $70 million a year.","H. H. Simmons","One final thing that needs to be taken into consideration is the fact that we have unlimited insurance on DDA up until December 31 of this year. And we show that we've got a lot of excess DDA balances, which we believe are coming from corporations that are here just because it's easy, and they've got unlimited FDIC insurance, so that too will soft -- as that money gets to the end of the year, expect some of that will leave and it will reduce the cash balances.","Doyle L. Arnold","And that's a significant number. I mean, depending on how we try to estimate that, we come up to something like $3 billion to $5 billion of that is commercial customers who were here several years ago and are still here and have that much more in their checking accounts than they did then.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just quickly, how much of cash at the parent did you have at the end of the quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","About $1 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Klock from Keefe, Bruyette.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on John's question about parent company cash. Doyle, I guess how much capacity do you have at the bank's upstream capital? And does that include the ability to redeem some of the preferred, or do you still have preferred that you can redeem?","Doyle L. Arnold","You mean preferred at the banks?","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","At the banks, right.","Doyle L. Arnold","I think over time that there is excess capital at the banks. I think withdrawing it requires regulatory approval, and we have had preliminary discussions with the regulators about the appropriate amount and pace and constraints on withdrawing it. I think with the -- until -- there are probably some constraints on that still, from concerns about the possibility of the double dip and the regulators were certainly part of the stress testing. It's not just overall capital of the company but capital under stress at the individual banks. And we've laid that all out for the regulators and showed them what we think, but it's going to be up to them to decide what they think. I will just point out that, which I think you're all aware, we did upstream $100 million in the fourth quarter by redeeming some -- from our Nevada State Bank subsidiary, by redeeming some of their preferred stock, or that the parent had sent their way. And we would expect that we'll do more of that at a very measured pace as we go through 2012.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right. And really, I guess, with the pace of your classified assets cleaning up and improving, I guess give you more capacity to upstream capital and carry, right?","Doyle L. Arnold","I would think it would over time, yes.","Brian Klock - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one real quick question, thanks for the color around the C&I growth. I would imagine that some of that syndicated credit growth was within the Amegy franchise. But can you give us an idea on the C&I growth, how much of it came from your different subsidiaries or your different regions?","Doyle L. Arnold","You're correct. The strongest was Amegy, followed by Zions Bank. I'm not sure who was in third place. Do you happen to have that information, James?","James R. Abbott","Yes. I would say 75% of it was those 2 banks. Very strong selling from Amegy in terms of that volume. And that was by far the strongest in terms of C&I growth.","Doyle L. Arnold","We're not fumbling -- we can get back to you with the other rather than hold up. We're not finding the right page here. But that's the bulk of it. There was -- there was a little bit of growth just about everywhere as you kind of -- and there was basically none of the banks showed net shrinkage in C&I.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Doyle, you mentioned that you're talking how sensitive your NIM is to loan growth. What loan growth assumptions are you making in terms of your 2 to 4 basis point NIM compression assumption?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, the 2 to 4 -- I mean you could -- the 2 to 4 basis points a quarter was the compression that results from older loans resetting or repricing as we go through 2012. So it would take an equivalent -- roughly an equivalent amount of reduction in funding costs, or it would take -- if you wanted to offset all of it with loan growth at a 300 basis point spread over cash, you can figure it's probably $500 million, $600 million a quarter if you had to do it all that way, but the reality is it will be probably -- we think it's quite feasible to see it offset by a combination of those 2 things.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just to be clear, though. So that's the loan aspect of it. Do you guys have any expectations for all-in NIM compression, given a set level of loan growth?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, we're not trying to focus on the NIM compression all-in because it is so crazy right now with this $1 billion of cash coming in, in one quarter and then some -- hundreds of millions of it coming -- going out in the first week of the next quarter. That's the biggest...","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, totally understandable. I guess of the 13 basis points, 8 is the cash impact so you can certainly set that aside. It's more of the 5 basis points of your other security or loan and earning asset-related compression...","Doyle L. Arnold","And it was mostly all driven by the loans and the repricing of older loans and resetting of older floors. So and it's kind of that 5 that you should compare to the 2 to 4 that we outlined as being -- and it varies -- we've tried to schedule out the maturity resets of the loans for the next 4 quarters. James has actually mucked around and done that, and it kind of varies between 2 and 4 per quarter depending on which quarter you're in. If every loan that matured in quarter 2 reset at today's spreads, what would the -- and all of that, that would result in, depending on the quarter, 2 to 4 basis points per quarter from that. And we're saying we think that the current spreads over a matched maturity cost of funds are kind of in the 3.25% over range. So if you -- it doesn't take a lot of loans. If you were going to offset, totally the impact of that little bit of compression with loan growth, you can calculate it out, just do 3% over earning of the cash and you get to about $600 million a quarter that it would take. But I'm saying that's not the only source of how you offset it. There's funding costs, I believe, are still drifting down a little bit, and there's a little more room to go there too. But we had a -- it was a bit larger reset impact in the fourth quarter than we expect to see over the next few, at 5 basis points compared to 2 to 4.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, now that helps. And then just very quickly on the expense guidance of up in the first quarter. Does that adjust for sort of the unusual expense items that you had this quarter? Or is that...","Doyle L. Arnold","No, not necessarily...","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Or just in absolute, it's going to be up...","Doyle L. Arnold","We're expecting mostly about kind of a salary and benefit line have some -- usually picks up in the first quarter because you're starting a new year with everybody, all the FICO and Medicare accruals and all that stuff. Anything I'm missing here, James? We weren't trying to say that we expect it to go up notwithstanding the $15 million of kind of one-off items that we broke out for you.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So we [indiscernible]...","Doyle L. Arnold","It would be in addition to that, yes. We weren't trying to say it's going to go up even in addition to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I'll start, I just wanted to clarify, the loan payoffs that you're saying you saw here in the first quarter, were these the same customer that borrowed from you in the fourth quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","No. No, no, no. These are the older loans that had fixed rates. Some of them would've been things like 5\/1 ARMs, and back in time had some commercial mortgages, 5-year resets, et cetera.","H. H. Simmons","I want to make sure we got your question...","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I think I got you. So the rate reset higher and people basically paid these off essentially. I'm just trying to get at...","Doyle L. Arnold","No. The margin compression was due to loans that maybe were 5\/1 ARMs or 3\/1s that were made in 2006, 2007, that came up to the end of that  -- when rates were quite a bit higher. And they came to the reset. And they reset at a much lower rate because the break to which -- the index is lower. Spread stayed the same, the index was lower, so the overall rate comes down. So that's one issue. That's what drove a lot of the 5 basis point compression.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But Doyle, I wasn't asking for that. I'm asking for -- no, I'm asking for you referenced the loan payoffs early in the first quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes. What I think that was, people just drawing down on lines and for whatever reason to show more cash on their balance sheet or whatever and then repaying -- paying them back down. I mean, we haven't done it in customer-by-customer analysis, but there was a big increase in deposits, there was a big increase in loans. And the 2 may not have been unrelated. If the customer drew down on their loan and held the cash on deposit with us for whatever reason, I haven't tried to see if that's tightly linked. But we saw a big run-up in December of both loans and a lot of it commercial and commercial DBA balances. And in each case, somewhere between, I don't know, probably 30%, 40% of the increase got reversed out in the first week of January. Lines got paid back down, cash, the DDA balances went back down.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. Just one other follow-up question. With NII expected flat in 2012, the lower provision benefit is now basically in the earnings run rate. Any plans to cut cost in 2012 to improve profitability from where it is?","Doyle L. Arnold","Do you want to talk, Harris, you want to...","H. H. Simmons","Well, just ongoing programs. I mean, we've continued to close down some branches. We've closed about 10 offices this past year. We got several others kind of on the drawing board. We don't see a big across-the-board kind of cut. We actually, back in 2009, quite dramatically cut some of the kind of core operating costs. And I think it is getting tougher to do that. I think where you're going to see costs coming down is in OREO expense credit costs. Those are the areas where we've really seen major increases, and they will continue to come down. But I think it's something we continue to work at but as we go along, we're quite focused on activities, branches, et cetera, that aren't making long-term sense as we look forward. So but we're not going to be reporting today a big project, if you will.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Stulpin from Raymond James.","William Christian Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Regarding your C&I loan growth, Doyle, you mentioned roughly 1\/3 was from syndicated relationships of syndicated loans. What has that ratio been typically in the past, or has it fluctuated greatly?","Doyle L. Arnold","We haven't specifically tried to look at that in the past because the question hadn't particularly come up. I doubt if it's a whole lot different. I will note that the percentage of our total loans that are accounted for by syndicated loans has been pretty constant quarter-to-quarter for a while. It's not...","William Christian Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Over the years.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, over the last couple of years, I mean. But as far as -- it's kind of hard to even answer the question because we've had slight net loan growth or net loan shrinkage over the last few quarters, so the percentage of that change that came from syndicated probably isn't very meaningful. But in terms of our total overall activity, it's roughly a constant portion of the balance sheet.","William Christian Stulpin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And I guess my follow-up question, you mentioned that pricing has improved slightly. I was kind of surprised by that given the commentary I heard from other peers within your market that said it's still very intense. And I get the impression that you're having more banks entering your market, or at least more banks participating in growing loans within your market, given the arguably recovering economy. Can you speak about the pricing within your market?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I can speak to overall. I mean, we did -- I wouldn't get too fixated on this uptick of a couple -- a few basis points. But if I look back over the last 6 months, the all-in spread over matched maturity cost of funds kind of all originations of all kinds month-to-month-to-month-to-month has been fairly stable now in the 300 to 350 range, given our mix of loans. That's 300 to 350 over matched maturity cost of funds. That is down very sharply from where it was 2 years ago, 18 months ago, when it got up over 500. But it does seem to have come back to kind of the floor level where it was pre-crisis. And the rest of it is just, I think, anecdotally what James and we're hearing by talking to a number of our relationship officers, it's not that it's gotten better, it's just stopped getting brutally worse each quarter. It's somewhat more stabilized. Probably the area that we're hearing a little bit of increases is would probably be the result of some of the larger European banks perhaps shying away from the U.S. market to some degree, and that's allowing the U.S. banks to price a little bit better on some of those types of credits. That's probably the predominant area. On your small and middle market, you're seeing fairly stable pricing linked quarter. In most markets, I would comment that Nevada is still experiencing price weakness, and Nevada had generally a weak performance across their loan portfolio as a result of that not wanting to cave in on pricing. So but that the -- they're struggling, the market is struggling significantly, so that's probably a little color for you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","This is Jennifer Demba. I have a question about Durbin. Can you talk to us about strategy you're looking at to offset Durbin? And is the service charge run rate a good one going forward?","Doyle L. Arnold","One of the benefits of having 8 banks is that we kind of have 8 different strategies for offsetting that. We've left that to the banks, and they are, in fact, going to be doing different things. I mean we're look at various combinations of what others have done, monthly service charges, higher minimum balances, other things. But it all doesn't necessarily have to come out of the same consumers that -- or the fee erosion from Durbin came from. Now the $8 million reflects very little offset. We do expect that over the course of 2012 offset some of that, not all, somewhere between 1\/3 and 2\/3 probably, or where the banks have identified strategies. Harris, do you want to comment any further on that or...","James R. Abbott","No, I think that's, I think, where we are.","Doyle L. Arnold","Okay. It should get a little better as time goes on.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question. Can you just talk in general about what you're seeing in the real estate market in Nevada and Arizona?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'll let Ken Peterson, the Chief Credit Officer, talk about that.","Kenneth E. Peterson","Nevada and Arizona, in particular, it's is still pretty flat. Very few opportunities. And that's not where we're seeing the opportunities in the commercial real estate. We are seeing some growth and opportunities in the coastal regions of California. We're seeing some in Texas and a little bit in Colorado. But not a whole lot of green shoots coming out of the 2 desert states.","Doyle L. Arnold","But at the same time, we're not seeing a re-deterioration of credit quality.","Kenneth E. Peterson","I think we have worked through most of our problems there, it's pretty flat. We're looking at a lot of different areas for opportunities. The commercial real estate is not our real growth opportunity at this point in the market in those states.","Doyle L. Arnold","I would also add that we also -- I mean, we've seen stability in loan outstandings in those 2 target markets. But it's coming as a result of some growth in C&I and some consumers. So there's -- they're not continuing to shrink but it's -- we're having to offset some CRE shrinkage to stand still.","H. H. Simmons","Just a couple of little things to add. Vacancy rates in Las Vegas basically flat quarter-over-quarter. Vacancy rates in Phoenix improving somewhat. Cap rates actually are a pretty good story in both markets. Cap rates are coming down fairly significantly in both markets and have been for a while, from about 9% or so a couple of years ago to about 7%, 7.5%. That's still 150 basis points over other more established -- or not more established, but over more healthy markets like Los Angeles. Rent growth is still very, very anemic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The Nevada State dividend, I think that really came from more of a position of kind of capital and reserve strength probably more than earnings power. But I'm wondering, can you talk about what other subs you have that are in a position to dividend capital up this year?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, you're correct about Nevada, that was a return of capital, not a return on capital. But we have received dividends on preferred and common stock from California Bank & Trust, expect those to continue. From Zions Bank, expect those to continue -- actually, we have approval for this quarter, I don't know if that one has actually come. And from Amegy Bank, and expect those to continue. And those, of course, are the 3 largest banks that collectively account for 3\/4 or more of the franchise from -- it will be a little -- it will be much smaller and a little more episodic from the other banks in 2012.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then with your comments of $1 billion of liquidity at the holdco, I think you have about $1.4 billion of debt. But how should we think about both debt and dividend coverage at the holding company in terms of the NIM level that you sort of don't want to break through future potential capital actions?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I don't want to go into -- I don't want to outline the whole capital and financing plan that we submitted to the Fed. But there are various components of it including dividends and return of capital from the banks, some financing actions. We've got $255 million of senior notes that were TLGP-guaranteed, for example, maturing in June that need to be refinanced. Our general thinking at this point is that we want to maintain at least 12 months, and preferably a bit more than that, of time to require funding at the parent. But it's going to be hard for you to piece together from that statement what the individual components are. And since they're all under review by the Fed, I'm not going to help you resolve that on this call. There is a path to get there, after March 15.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Really just 2 clarifications. First, you talked about net interest income being relatively stable over the next year. Just to clarify, do you mean stable with fourth quarter levels or with full year 2011 levels? And also, are you talking about reported or core net interest income?","Doyle L. Arnold","We were hoping you wouldn't get that -- quite that picky. I think the reference was primarily with regard to the -- it's for the fourth quarter, which was, if you look at net interest income before provision, that was down from the third but it was the second highest. I guess -- and I'm not trying to be cute here. We don't know. One of the -- the first one of the bigger hits to that number on a GAAP basis has been the sub debt conversions, and we won't know and announce until February 15 or thereabouts what the first quarter impact would be. It's right now, the notices that we have a very, very small, but they always are this far in advance. Most of that comes in, in the last few days. But it's based on -- it's basically, that guidance was based on it being similar to what we've been seeing the last couple of quarters, which was kind of $15 million or so.","James R. Abbott","It's getting to a point where we'd expect that the -- just the mathematics of this results in low levels of conversions.","Doyle L. Arnold","Joe, I would add that our accountants are quite pleased that the GAAP and non-GAAP measures actually converged this quarter, they were essentially unchanged, which makes every accountant happy. And the arch spread on the sub debt right now is between 1 point and 2 points. So it's not very attractive for anybody playing that game to convert. And it is a fourth quarter '11 to fourth quarter '12 outlook is what we're looking at.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. Okay. And then the other was, again not trying to pin you down to anything, but you talked about provision being relatively low. Is that more likely to be a 0 or a low-type number, or could we also see continued modest negative provisions?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm not sure I'll let you pin me down because it's going to be what it will be, but if we have no uptick in severity of loss and we have continued reduction in classifieds and, as we have said, meaningfully lower charge-offs this quarter, it's hard to see how you get from -- absent a dramatic change in the economic environment, how you get from there to a significant positive number. So it's probably in near 0 or a little lower.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A few questions for you. Doyle, you talked a little bit before that you still have some room on the deposit pricing side. And I'm just looking at the numbers, you still probably have amongst the highest all-in cost of liabilities among the peer group. And the mix has been improving as well as far as the non-interest-bearing inflows as well. So I'm just wondering, how much lower do you think that all-in cost of funding can go from the 104? And is that -- and even so, that still won't be enough to offset the loan side pressures?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I mean, if you look, for example, at the time of -- time deposits on Page 15 of 84 basis points, I could just tell you that's way above current posted rates. So as those time deposits mature, it's going to reset at numbers between 5 and 30 basis points probably, depending upon balance and term. And so just out of that -- and there's nothing driving anything else higher on this page right now. So I think you can read -- you should read into that a little bit of continued favorable impact of funding costs. I haven't scheduled it out to see kind of, okay, what is it likely to be if everything just rolls off, but it's been coming down a steady kind of mid- to upper mid-single digits per quarter for quite a while. And probably you'll get mid-single-digit basis points decline in the next couple.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, great. And then second question, and you had mentioned something in the release about a little bit of a pickup in term CRE in California. I'm wondering how much of that growth in the term bucket is still coming out of the construction bucket? And also just if you can give us a broader comment on what, if any, activity you're starting to see in that CRE side of the portfolio?","Doyle L. Arnold","Most of it is -- I mean, there is some of it that's maturing construction but most of it is not. I don't know the exact breakdown. And I don't know, Ken or Harris, do you want to add color?","H. H. Simmons","I was going to say, it's only $60 million that converted from term -- well from construction in the whole company, not just California, but the whole company was $60 million that converted from construction to term this quarter.","Kenneth E. Peterson","And most of the product that we're seeing is in multi-family in California and elsewhere in the CRE spaces.","H. H. Simmons","The current CRE spaces.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a broader comment on that, I mean, do you think you're starting to see the turn of commercial real estate? Is there any major change in terms of project interest and refinancings that you're starting to see from at least a interest level or coming in the door type of thing?","Kenneth E. Peterson","Major would not be a word I'd use in the sentence. We are seeing some, and anecdotal, a little bit even in single-family, in top areas of Southern California. And we're seeing some apartments in Texas and in California. But there's no major rush to jump into real estate that we're seeing on the demand side.","Doyle L. Arnold","And particularly, if you're trying to ask more broadly about office and retail and other items, I would echo what Ken said. There's no...","Kenneth E. Peterson","They're one-off opportunities, but again, no major shifts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Penala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just actually one question, I know we're close to closing time. But just wanted to follow up on your answer to Ken Zerbe's question on the expenses. So Doyle, you mentioned $15 million should be taken out of the base, when we're thinking about the expense base in 2012. So are we growing for seasonality from $410 million? And if so, what is sort of the progression over the next 3 quarters? I'm guessing that based off of Harris' comments, it's likely flattish from that level, or could you take it down from first quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, again, the other place you're going to -- I would expect you're going to see it continues to come down. There are a couple of lines there, credit-related expenses and OREO expense, which should continue to trend down as problem assets continue to come down. So you almost need to take that out. And ultimately, we'll continue to see some reduction in FDIC insurance premiums, which is another reasonably large item.","H. H. Simmons","Yes. The FDIC insurance premium is now risk adjusted. They are risk-rated, as you may know. And it's tied in part to CAMEL ratings. And it's done bank by bank. And we're not saying what our CAMEL ratings are, let me just say that there's room to improve and they are selectively improving. We've had several individual CAMEL ratings change favorably over the last 6 months at various banks. And we expect that based on trends, more of that will happen. And if and as it happens, that, all else being equal, drives -- it will drive a reduction in FDIC. But kind of back to your question, yes, I would think the run rate of which you're starting is closer to probably 410 in the fourth quarter. The number specifically that will go -- will balance up in the first quarter, is salaries and employee benefits. You can kind of look at what happened first quarter last year compared to fourth quarter, it was up from 207 to 215 there on Page 10. A lot of that was due to the fact that everybody's paying FICA and the accruals for that are reset. And then it's tapers off as more and more people hit the salary caps from which FICA is deducted. So you've got -- yes, you're going to have an uptick in salary and benefits. You've got some line items and had some one-offs of them, and then you've got a couple of other line items that should be stable or to trending favorably during the year.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And just remind us on your annual expense base or your current run rate, however you'd want to frame it, how much are you incurring currently in terms of credit-related costs in your operating expense base?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, we tried to break out that on Page 10, Erika. There's in the noninterest expense line, we break out 3 items that are clearly credit-related.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Oh, I see it, I'm sorry. You're right. That was my mistake.","Doyle L. Arnold","There's clearly other that's credit-related in salaries and benefits. It's the costs of the work of the people and workout and whatnot. But the intent would be in the salary benefit to -- and we've already done some of this, as the problem loan pile continues to come down, we shifted people 3 years ago from line into workout, and we will be shifting some of those people back from workout into line. But yes, you can see the OREO expense, the other credit-related expenses, these are things like legal fees that are related to credit, appraisals, foreclosure expenses, things of that nature. And then you've got the unfunded lending commitments.","H. H. Simmons","As you can see, and the most significant cost pressure, really, other than credit-related has been -- hasn't been regulatory kinds of imperatives, it's been staffing, stress testing, it's been additional compliance people and all the stuff that's coming out of Dodd-Frank, et cetera. It's been consulting costs around getting all of that work done. So we're focused pretty hard at what we can do, including centralizing additional back-office functions. We've done a lot of the heavy lifting there but there's some additional work we are engaged in. And trying very hard to try to slim down where we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Patten from Morgan Keegan.","Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Erika got most of my questions. I guess the other question I was going to ask is, when you say significant drop in charge-offs, you guys have been declining 10 bps a quarter last couple of quarters, and so you were doing significant, I don't know if your definition is the same as mine, but does that mean double, 20 bps?","Doyle L. Arnold","I don't know, it just means significant. We'll tell you next quarter. If you're thinking in those terms, you're not going to be thinking in the wrong direction.","Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then one last real quickie. On the C&I, you guys had a couple of hundred million of attrition in the beginning of first quarter. Is your growth view making that $200 million up and then adding to it? Or are you just thinking to get that back to your growth?","Doyle L. Arnold","I would hopefully probably get that back and maybe add a little to it over the course of the quarter. But we're so early in the quarter and it's hard to know. But if we stayed where we are right now, average loan growth for the quarter would be up more than it was last quarter. ","All right. With that, I just want to -- before I let James close it, I just want to let everybody know that while we were doing this call, it started snowing. And we had a lot of -- after a very slow start, we had a lot of snow over the weekend and more coming down now. So we hope -- we know many of you, maybe most of you, are planning to come to our investor conference in a few weeks, and look forward to seeing you, and maybe some of you can stay around and enjoy a little of Utah outdoors with us on Friday.","James R. Abbott","Thank you, everyone. If you haven't heard about the Investor Day, please feel free to call me or e-mail me and we'll get you on an invitation. And it's on Thursday, February 16. We look forward to seeing you. Thank you, again, and we'll talk to you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program.

You've joined Zions Bancorporation's second quarter 2017 earnings results webcast. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James Abbott","Thank you, Latif and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2017 second quarter earnings. To begin, we will hear prepared remarks from, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer. Additional executives with us in the room today include, Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer; as well as other Zions executives who are available to address your questions during the question-and-answer section.","I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com and we will be referring to these slides during the call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including preprovision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and the GAAP financials is provided within the published documents and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.","We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. During the question-and-answer section of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to 1 primary and 1 related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions. With that, I will now turn the time over to our Chairman and CEO, Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thanks very much, James and we want to welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our second quarter results. On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. We were pleased with the strength of the loan growth and the sources of that growth, notably C&I loans, excluding oil and gas loans, consumer loans and there was less dependence on commercial real estate loans than in years past. We were pleased to contain the cost of deposits and the combination of those 2 factors led to a healthy increase in sustainable net interest income.","Finally, we're very pleased with the trends in credit quality, particularly in the oil and gas space which has been a substantial portion of our problem credits in recent quarters. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation.","On Slide 4, our adjusted preprovision net revenue reflects steady improvement, up 27% year-over-year and about 19% if one excludes the interest income recovered on 4 larger previously charged-off loans that we call out as unlikely to be sustained. Some of the growth is due to the benefits of rising interest rates and securities purchases which we do not expect to be as significant of a contributor to growth over the foreseeable future, but we do expect continued solid loan growth and customer-related fee income growth that we expect will contribute to further positive operating leverage.","Turning to Slide 5. We posted an efficiency ratio of 59.8% in the second quarter. Excluding the interest recoveries described throughout the release, the ratio would be closer to 61%. Because of seasonal factors in both revenue and expense, it's more appropriate to compare the efficiency ratio to the year ago quarter as shown in the chart on the left, our goal for 2017 is to achieve an efficiency ratio in the low 60s range, while holding adjusted noninterest expense growth to between 2% and 3% from the 2016 actual results of $1,580,000,000.","As we have highlighted many times before, we're achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects. We were very pleased with the successful implementation of the consumer loan module of the core system which took place over the Memorial Day weekend. And I really want to complement hundreds of employees and particularly the management team for that project on a very successful systems conversion for our consumer loan portion of this project that took place several weeks ago.","We expect that these investments will ultimately make the company more efficient and reduce risk and beyond these technology investments, we're investing in the hiring of relationship managers and similar positions that we expect will enhance our revenue growth. In the back office, we continue to work hard to identify additional opportunities to become more efficient.","Moving to Slide 6. We experienced softer loan growth over the last years than was desired, but as we said in conference appearances in recent weeks, we experienced a solid second quarter, up nearly 9% on an annualized basis. One of the strengths this past quarter has been on 1- to 4-family loan area which experienced an 11% annualized rate of growth and had that a similar growth rate over the prior year's level. We also experienced strength in commercial and industrial and owner-occupied loans. We were not dependent upon commercial real estate for growth in the quarter, although we continue to originate new loans for customers, we're adhering to our internal concentration limits and we expect only moderate growth in commercial real estate as a result.","Loan growth outpaced deposit growth in the quarter, with a moderate period and deposit attrition, we increased wholesale funding and utilized cash and securities to fund the loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, period-end deposits increased 4.2% and average deposits increased 4.8%.","Slide 7 depicts the overall credit quality metrics of our loan portfolio. We're encouraged with a meaningful improvement in classified loans, nonperforming assets and net charge-offs. Much of the improvement came from the oil and gas portfolio and we remain optimistic that we'll continue to see further favorable changes to oil and gas credit metrics as we continue to see strengthening revenue and cash flows from many of these companies.","Slide 8 depicts 2 key profitability metrics, return on assets; and return on tangible common equity. Return on assets increased to 103 basis points in the second quarter. And excluding the items listed in the bullet, the ROA was in the mid-90s, up from the mid-70s a year ago. Return on tangible common equity increased to 10.2% from 6.3% a year ago. And excluding interest recoveries on 4 loans, it would've been in the low 9% area. I'd note that we achieved that with one of the strongest equity positions among regional banks. We're encouraged by the continued improvement and remain focused on achieving highly competitive returns on our balance sheet, both assets and equity, relative to peers.","Before I turn the time over to Paul to discuss the financial results further, I'm pleased to report that our capital plan for the next 4 quarters triples the common dividend rate and increases the dollars allocated to share repurchase by more than 250% relative to the prior 4 quarters. Given the expected balance sheet growth, we expect we'll see some moderate increase in the leverage of the balance sheet which should also help improve our return on equity.","With that overview, I'm going to turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to further review the financial results. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 9. For the second quarter of 2017, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $154 million or $0.73 per share which is up from $0.44 per share in the year ago period. There are some items within the second quarter 2017 result that are operating but generally infrequent and those include, interest recoveries of $60 million on 4 loans that had previously been charged off; securities gains of $2 million; income tax benefits that are not expected to recur in a material amount which were about $4 million in the second quarter; and accelerated recognition of preferred stock issuance costs of $2 million due to the redemption of preferred shares in the second quarter. These items amount to about $13 million in after-tax dollars or about $0.06 per share.","Let me make a few comments about revenue. Approximately 80% of our revenue comes from net interest income. Slide 10 depicts the recent trend in net interest income which continued to demonstrate growth in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, quarterly net interest income was up $71 million or 14% and about $55 million or 10% if one excludes the aforementioned loan recovery income.","The most significant factor in the year-over-year increase in net interest income is the $5.9 billion period end and $6.7 billion average balance increase of the investment securities portfolio. Slide 11 shows the growth in the period end balances. If I extend the time period back just a bit further, since the fourth quarter of 2015, the growth of securities has resulted in about $185 million of increased interest income annually. Before I move on to the next slide, I will reiterate that we continue to exercise caution with respect to duration extension risk and combined with a relatively flat yield curve, utilize some of the cash flow from the securities portfolio in the second quarter to fund our excellent loan growth.","Slide 12 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type, relative to the year ago period. The size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios. Total growth, including the effects of a declining oil and gas portfolio and the national real estate portfolio, was 2.8%. We experienced 4.2% year-over-year growth in loans outside of the oil and gas portfolio and we now expect oil and gas loans to stabilize generally from here, providing some improvements to the overall growth profile over the next several quarters. The key take away from this chart is the relatively balanced growth for most of the circles, i.e. loan portfolios. Commercial and industrial, C&I, owner occupied, construction and home equity loans all increased in the mid-single-digit range while we experienced solid growth in the 1-4 Family loan portfolio, offset by weakness in oil and gas and national real estate loans. Excluding national real estate loans, commercial real estate loans were relatively stable, up only $27 million over the prior year. As we discussed over the past several quarters, our internal commitment to manage our portfolio of concentration limits is the reason for the general stability in the commercial real estate portfolio. Shown in the bottom is our expectation for loan growth by product type.","Turning to the rate component of net interest income on Slide 13, this slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is the loan yield which increased 24 basis points from the prior quarter to 4.38%. But as noted in the press release, about 15 basis points was attributable to key recoveries of interest income. The remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in short term benchmark interest rates. The securities portfolio yield decreased 4 basis points this quarter compared to last quarter which is due largely to higher premium amortization on our SBA portfolio within the securities portfolio. Our cost of total deposits increased only slightly relative to the prior quarter. While we're monitoring the competitive landscape and will act accordingly, we're not seeing systemic pressure on deposit pricing. The cost of interest-bearing funds increased somewhat compared to the prior quarter due to increased wholesale borrowings which were used to fund our strong loan growth in the second quarter.","On the bottom right side of the slide is a table of the various indices to which our loans are indexed, with the first column of numbers showing the gross percentage of loans linked to the respective indices and the second column of numbers showing the offsetting effects from floors and swaps, while the third column represents the net effect. Compared to the prior quarter, there is not a significant difference, although some loans have moved off of their floors at this point and beginning in July, the swap portfolio has begun to experience some limited attrition.","On Slide 14, we have adopted our new model which is a single-point estimate of the effect on net interest income in a rate environment that is 200 basis points higher than the current level. We have also shown the results of the model we had been using for the last several years for comparative purposes. The primary difference between the models is a refinement in the new model, regarding how much of the deposit base is treated as core versus transitory.","Turning to Slide 15 and noninterest income. Total noninterest income was $132 million which was up from $126 million a year ago. Customer-related fees, shown on the slide, increased to $121 million from $118 million a year ago and were up from $115 million in the prior quarter. We made good progress on card-related income, up $2 million from the prior quarter; low fee income which is up about $1.5 million on good progress with our new loan syndication platform; as well as good performance on Wealth Management and on customer interest rate hedging activity.","Turning to management activity, it was relatively stable from the prior quarter. As noted in the press release, noncustomer related activity, such as securities gains and dividends from small business investment company investments, contributed to the bottom line, although not as much as in the prior quarter. As we continue to focus on customer-related fee income, we're still targeting mid-single-digit annual growth for the full year 2017.","Noninterest expense on Slide 16 increased to $405 million from $382 million in the year ago quarter. If adjusted for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other similar items, noninterest expense increased to $399 million from $385 million in the year ago period. Notably, salaries and employee benefits were relatively stable from the year ago period at $242 million, up only $1 million. Year-over-year, FDIC premiums and the revenue sharing agreement with the FDIC on loans purchased, equaled about $6 million, the former of which is largely due to the temporary surcharge by the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank Act and the latter is linked to stronger revenue performance and as such, both items are somewhat transitory in nature. Excluding these items, the year-over-year increase in adjusted noninterest expense was approximately 2%. The key changes relative to the prior quarter are listed on the slide, so I won't take any more time here other than to reaffirm our expectation that total noninterest expense is likely to increase between 2% and 3% in 2017 when compared to the 2016 actual results.","On Slide 17 is a list of our key objectives for the remainder of 2017 and 2018 and our commitment to shareholders. We're fully committed to continue to achieve positive operating leverage. We have a couple of years behind us at this point in our effort to materially improve profitability and grow earnings. We remain committed to further improvement and simplification of our operational processes. Harris mentioned the foundational technology improvement earlier in his comments today, so I'll move on to capital. When we first rolled out this slide, we indicated that we were going to be targeting much more substantial returns on capital, than what could be seen then and we're tracking well toward those goals. Regarding returns of capital, we indicated that we plan to be more assertive in our capital plan for the Horizontal Capital Review in 2017 and we're pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our new capital plan, the key actions of which are outlined on this slide.","Finally, Slide 18 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We're maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing which is to be interpreted as an annual rate of growth in the mid-single digits. Using a modified net interest income of $512 million which excludes the $60 million of interest recoveries on 4 loans that we have called out as transitory, we expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next 12 months. We're not assuming an additional rate hike in this outlook and we do not expect further benefit from the rate increase thus far in 2017. Additional increases in short term rates are expected to improve net interest income.","Turning to the provision for credit losses. We posted a net provision for both funded loans and unfunded commitments of $10 million in the second quarter. We said throughout the quarter that we were becoming increasingly optimistic that the credit deterioration from the oil and gas portfolio was turning or had turned the quarter. Despite somewhat lower prices for oil, the health of the companies within our portfolio continues to improve and we're effectively reducing our outlook for credit costs from the April outlook which was about $18 million per quarter, down to about $10 million per quarter or maybe slightly higher, with a few million dollar range of imprecision. This also assumes that energy prices do not experience a substantial decline from the current level. We expect that customer-related fees which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase moderately from the level reported in the first quarter.","We currently expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase in 2017 between 2% and 3%, relative to the 2016 reported results. Because our outlook now extends to the first half of 2018, in order to preempt the question about growth in 2018, we believe it could grow in a similar range for that year as well, although we're not planning to loosen up on our efforts to streamline and simplify various processes. One example we've begun to shine a spotlight on is procurement in taking costs out of our supply chain. We're in the first inning of that effort. We don't expect large numbers of physical branch reductions, as digital adoption continues to take hold, but we do expect some fine-tuning of physical branch locations. At the same time, we want to hire strong talent that will drive revenue growth and enhance the value of the franchise and that is the general rationale for expense levels which may increase slightly.","Excluding the adjustments for the 2017 accounting guidance for stock-based compensation, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the 34% to 35% range for the next 4 quarters, barring any meaningful changes in the tax code. We expect cumulative preferred dividends to be approximately $34 million over the next 4 quarters and diluted shares may fluctuate, due to both share repurchases and the dilutive effect from our outstanding warrants. The dilutive effect of the warrants is predominantly dependent upon the price of our shares which we described in the January earnings report. Please see the appendix of our test slide deck for further sensitivities on the warrant effect.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Emlen Harmon of JMP Securities.","Emlen Harmon","You guys had included in your capital return for this year, in your repurchase, you'd included the, up to the full CCAR ask amount. I mean, do you anticipate anything that could push you off a trajectory to complete that full amount?","Harris Simmons","Well, we don't at the moment, but it's obviously something that the Board's going to look at every quarter before they declare it and see if conditions have changed, either deterioration in the general economy or our portfolio, et cetera, but at the moment, we don't foresee anything.","Emlen Harmon","Got it. And then, deposit costs were really well controlled this quarter. How long do you guys feel like you can keep a lid on that? I mean, obviously you noted you're not seeing a whole lot yet. We have started to hear from some of your peers that there's a little bit more competition on the commercial side of things, but just be interested in your outlook on that.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, we're seeing a little more competition which I -- this is Paul which I referenced in my comments. We're not seeing systemic pressure, but we're seeing sort of one-off which we're addressing through kind of our regular processes. You would imagine this is critically important to our interest sensitivity and therefore, net interest margin and income and profitability, so we're watching this very, very closely. But as I said, we're not yet seeing any systemic pressure on deposit pricing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","Paul, I would ask you about the margin versus the NII. As you've been purchasing securities in the last couple of quarters, there wasn't really a substitution, so your balance sheet actually expanded. Is that why your margins didn't kind of expand as much, but yet NII kept the same pace of growth?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, Marty, by my calculation, these are very rough and approximate and probably subject to debate. But the securities portfolio of growth that we experienced in the first quarter was a headwind of about 8 basis points or so on the net interest margin. In the second quarter, I calculate that headwind to be 4 to 5 basis points. So that is to say, you correctly point out, the purchase of securities has actually expanded the size of the balance sheet, whereas in the past we were just replacing cash. So therefore the sort of marginal spread of what is being added is lower than that strict cash replacement which is why you're seeing a little bit of a headwind. Now with all that being said, as I said at the end of the first quarter call, the securities portfolio of growth is effectively done. In fact, you saw the securities portfolio, the ending balance was actually down a little bit, even though the average was up. So my expectation going forward is that net interest margin headwind will no longer be there.","Marlin Mosby","And then a follow-on to that. The second stage was the interest-bearing swap as you add to and begin to neutralize the sensitivity through the swaps. Do still feel like you're going to do that? And where will that show up? In what line item will that be a benefit?","Paul Burdiss","Well, Marty, I'll tell you, right now, our swaps portfolio is approximately -- at the end of June, it was about $1.4 billion and had a carry of about 10 basis points. The yield curve has become so flat that it's -- swaps aren't nearly as exciting as they used to be. But that being said, I think we're looking at least what's rolling off and kind of considering strategies to replace those to kind of maintain our current level of asset sensitivity. But without a really big change in sort of the shape of the curve or the risk return for kind of extending duration, I don't imagine that we're going to materially reduce our asset sensitivity from here, all other things equal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth Usdin","Just as a follow-up on the balance sheet. So Paul, if you're rightsized now on the securities book, in the last few quarters you've been using the wholesale borrowings, the short term funding to fill that GAAP which you said you would. Now -- but this quarter also, deposits shrunk a little bit. Can you just talk us through the dynamics of deposit growth versus the short term borrowings? And is any of the deposit shrinkage related to kind of an indirect data? Or how our customers moving money and is any of it related to the rate increases we've seen?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Sure, Ken. It's hard to specifically tie deposit movements to the change in the rates, at this point, because we're still kind of early innings, right? Anecdotally, I've heard of, kind of cash being used by our businesses for -- kind of investments and other things and so I'm not seeing anything systemic that would lead me to think that we have got deposit dollar movement because of changes in rates. That being said, while it's true that our ending balances were down, I do note that our average balances were actually up quarter-over quarter. We do, because of the nature of our deposits, we do see some volatility on any given day and so any time on period end balances, for example, you compare any 2 days and you could see some volatility. So I'm actually watching average balances much more carefully than the ending balances. And I am not seeing a discernible trend that is causing me concern, to think that we're beginning to see deposit run off. All that being said, deposits, well-priced, relationship-driven deposits are kind of really a big part of the core value of this organization. This is something we watch very, very closely and take very seriously and we will protect our deposit base.","Kenneth Usdin","Understood. Well put. And just one question on credit. You mentioned that there were the actually recoveries, all the NPA categories are looking good. You still have the 8% on energy as well. And you mentioned that provisions that are approximate or be slightly higher than this quarter which was as low as 7 on losses and 10 credit overall. Can you just talk us through just what -- there doesn't seem to be anything underneath, in terms of credit problems. So can you just talk us through what your expectation there on the provisions staying so low?","Paul Burdiss","Maybe I'll start with that, Scott, if it's all right, maybe you can jump in. The issue -- and what we said in the first quarter was that energy was going to continue to get better and we've actually observed that and there's an expectation that, that's going to continue. The dollar, you pointed out the energy reserves and I'll just remind everyone and thank you for saying it, that we're still holding over an 8% reserve on that energy portfolio. And so while the dollar amount of that reserve has gone down, the portfolio has also gone down a little, of which is why you're seeing really, strong sort of reserve ratio. So all that being said, the rest of the portfolio is performing so very well that it's hard to imagine that, given the sort of length we're in the credit cycle that, that can continue indefinitely. So as we think about potential weaknesses, what we're thinking about is everything else in the portfolio that's not energy and while we're not seeing any indication today as you correctly pointed out, that there is deterioration in the portfolio. Yes, we think it's possible. And so we try to embed that into our outlook.","Scott McLean","Hi, this is Scott McLean and I would just add to that, that clearly, assuming energy prices stay where they are we'll -- or better, we'll see continued improvement in that part of the portfolio at it'll mean less pressure on the provision. But as Paul notes, we're remaining cautious about where we're in the credit cycle. And secondarily, the loan growth is certainly there and it soaks up some of this provision requirement as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Moss of FBR.","Stephen Moss","I was wondering here, given your constructive comments on loan growth, how should we think about funding it, whether it's securities, deposits or continued increases in short term borrowings?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I'm certainly hopeful that we can continue the trend of solid deposit growth that we've seen. That is our first and best kind of source of funds. You correctly point out, we have, over the course of the last quarter, dipped into our cash position which I think on a relative basis, still very healthy and probably a little higher than it needs to be. And the securities portfolio is also sort of a ready source of funding. Absent all of those, then that's when we would look to the wholesale market. And we looked at that, I would say last, but we've got a lot of availability there. If you look at our debt relative to peers, you'll see that what we're one of the most deposit-funded organizations. And so while we expect to continue to be almost entirely deposit funded, we do have capacity to incrementally add debt to support loan growth.","Stephen Moss","Okay. And then, what were new money yields here for the second quarter?","James Abbott","Are you talking on loan yields or?","Stephen Moss","Loan originations for the quarter.","Scott McLean","Loan originations, probably about 4-15, 415 basis points on a yield basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","The common equity Tier 1 is still at 12.3%. Clearly the higher buyback of dividend, coupled with loan growth helps to bring that down a bit. But what's the right level for that ratio longer term? And how quickly do you think you can get there?","Harris Simmons","Well I think, as we look at kind of regional peers, we expect the end of the first quarter median for the group that we use for compensation for comparative purposes anyway, was about 10.4. And I don't know that we get to 10.4. I suspect we may want to stay a little north of that, but we've obviously got some room to either grow or continue to repatriate capital. And the course is pretty well set through the CCAR cycle. But as we go into next year, that's -- longer term, as we think about targets, it's probably someplace, in my mind, it's probably between 10.4 and 11, something like that.","Paul Burdiss","And I would remind you, Jeffrey, we've mentioned in the past, yes, we publish our semi-annual, kind of DFAST results and the loss content in our model is a lot loss less than the lost content in the Fed's model. So in terms of what we think we need to hold, right now we're being constrained, I would say through the Horizontal Capital Review process, but in fact we think we can hold less capital than that, as Harris said.","Geoffrey Elliott","And the Horizontal Capital Review process, what exactly do you mean by that?","Paul Burdiss","Oh, sorry, that's the process formerly known as CCAR for banks of our size and complexity. The name has changed, I don't know if the headlines have caught up with it yet.","Geoffrey Elliott","Okay. And then, but surely on the 10.4, I mean the peer group is going to move down over time, isn't it, as other banks are paying out 100% of earnings and growing loans a bit. So I mean isn't there, as a peer group moves down, then that's got to get lower than that?","Harris Simmons","Well, yes. And I'm actually just looking -- I had, I said 10.4. It was actually 10.7. So 30 basis points difference. The peer group may move our thinking about it phase. We'll -- I guess the point being, simply, I think we'll want to remain at or a little better than the peer group. I mean there's several ways to think about this, including using the results of our DFAST, our own internal models, et cetera. We want to be sure that in the downturn, that we've got plenty of capital, that we're not a laggard, so. That's something that we'll just keep evaluating. But I -- rather than be precise about it, I think the message is that we still have some room, right?","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester","Hey Paul, you've mentioned feeling hopeful about deposit growth going forward. We're just wondering, what you think the shape of that looks like over the next year. And if you think moderate deposit growth is something you can achieve in the current environment, so something in like the mid-single-digit range.","Paul Burdiss","I think mid-single-digits is going to be a little tough, to be honest with you. That being said, as I've said, we've actually been more successful over, certainly since I've been here, than our business leaders expected. We've got of a lot of very high-quality relationships that we continue to attract money into the bank. But the environment is changing and it's kind of hard for me to be really certain that we could achieve a deposit growth in the mid- to mid-single-digit range. I would like to do that, that frankly is probably going to be the high end of what I would expect.","David Rochester","Okay. And then just another question and then real quick, if I could. The loan book yield ex the recoveries was around 4.23. That was up about 8 bps if I back out recoveries this quarter and the reversal last quarter. Can you talk about the accretion of prepayment penalty income trends in 2Q that may have impacted that trend this quarter?","Paul Burdiss","It wasn't a measurable amount. We really -- we tried to call out what we thought was the big piece which was the recovery income. The rest of the pickup, as you correctly pointed out, we're largely ascribing to the change in short term rates. And if you go back to that slide that was in my comments where we described kind of the expected changing in coupon, attached to the change in index, I think you'll find that if you kind of run the math through, that sounds about right.","David Rochester","Yes, okay. And then just one last one if I could. Could you just talk about the performance of that new small business platform? You guys had adopted this quarter into the small business loan generating platform. I know you had a decent increase in pull through from that platform. And then, just any color on how much you [indiscernible] that was to grow this quarter?","Harris Simmons","I have Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer, talk about that. Michael?","Michael Morris","Thanks. We call that the business banking loan center, the BBLC. They've had very solid success, both in the approval and pull through rate. We've added balances of about $11 billion in a pretty short time period and we're we talking about...","Harris Simmons","Roughly $11 billion, excuse me, $11 million. Sorry. Anyway, the platform is up and running. It's running well. We like what we're seeing from a credit perspective. We like what we're seeing from a yield perspective. And certainly, the turn time within that platform has been greatly shortened.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill.","Bradley Milsaps","Just wanted to follow up on the provision guidance of around $10 million. You guys have had, at least this quarter, a pretty healthy dose of recoveries. Is that also a part of your calculus? I know those are hard to anticipate, but just kind of curious kind of what the pipeline for further recoveries if there was a big driver this quarter, if that kind of plays into kind of some of your guidance there as well?","Paul Burdiss","I'll start up out and then maybe my partners here can join and. I will remind you that it's not explicitly $10 million, it's sort of $10 million plus, so maybe a little more than $10 million. Yes, there are recoveries in there. But yes, we're looking at the credit quality of the portfolio and we generally have a pretty decent insight into the sort of upcoming charge-off that's generally true. And so our expectation is the credit performance continues to be so strong, that we could modestly adjust that outlook for provision, downward from what we've seen in the first quarter.","Scott McLean","This is Scott. I would just add that as you noted, recoveries -- projecting recoveries, it's very episodic, it's hard to do. But when you look at the levels of energy charge-offs we've had in the last 24 months, just any rule of thumb recovery rate on that should produce a higher level of recoveries than we've experienced say, in 2014 or '15.","Bradley Milsaps","And just one follow-up, if I may. Scott, just -- would see if you could comment on any additional color, maybe specifically on Amegy, looks like that was about 40% of the growth in loans this quarter, including a big chunk in C&I, x oil and gas. Just kind of curious what trends you see there, if there's any kind of chunky pieces in the C&I or any other color you could offer around Texas?","Scott McLean","Sure. Happy to do that. One influence was the fact that energy loans were flat as opposed to contracting by, anywhere from $100 million to $150 million a quarter which is what we've been experiencing, so that's the sort of the bullet point #1. But more importantly, the math, they've just seen really solid middle market, small business, lower end of corporate growth. And they've really seen that pretty consistently through last year and through the first half of this year. So I would just describe it as good, solid, community banking, middle market, private banking, loan opportunities, very granular and the -- of note as well is on the CRE side, there's virtually no new underwriting going on there. There is some, but not, it's not adding to loan balances, materially. The 1-4 Family business is doing very well in Texas and we've not seen any real energy impact on FICO scores, et cetera, but a little bit of deterioration, but not much. So it's just good, granular, community banking type activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba of Suntrust.","Jennifer Demba","Around the national commercial real estate portfolio, what is the size of that now? How long before that likely stabilizes?","James Abbott","Yes, hi Jennifer, this is James. We've got $1.8 billion at this time and maybe I'll turn the call over to Michael here to talk about some changes in policy on that.","Michael Morris","Yes, I would add that the national real estate portfolio average balance is below $1 million per ticket. So it's very granular, it's starting to slow down, the attrition is starting to slow down. We've made a couple of changes to the platform and it should invite some new loan growth, but nothing that would rock the charts. But it's a platform that we will stay with and continue to grow where and when we can.","Harris Simmons","I would be help hopeful that it's, that we're within probably 3 to 4 quarters of it really stabilizing and starting to grow. That would be my best guess, but it's purely that. It's largely a function of how much liquidity is out there, particularly with the Community Banks we like. We sourced a fair amount of this product from a network of Community Banks around the country and they're all very liquid. And so that slowed the originations, but it's getting to a point where it will start to stabilize.","Jennifer Demba","Okay. Follow-up question. You mentioned, Paul that you're in the very early innings of supply chain cost improvement initiatives. Any way you can quantify the opportunity there?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, Jennifer and I think you probably heard me talk about this before. Unfortunately, I can't quantify that yet. I will say we're kind of completely modernizing our supply chain process. And I expect that there's going to be a lot of efficiencies to come out of that. And we highlight that is one example, because we get the question a lot around keys. It seems like you guys have really controlled expenses over the course of the next couple of years. How much longer can you do that? And the point of highlighting that is to say that, there continues to be opportunities as we, have consolidated the charters 18 months ago, continuing to work through kind of back office and other sort of operational efficiencies, there continues to be opportunities to continue to make substantial investments in the business, while controlling expenses. And so I can't really quantify that 1 without probably going through a whole other laundry list of all other things, including things we might be investing in. So I don't want to mislead you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Kenneth Zerbe","Two quick questions. I guess, the first in terms of the oil and gas portfolio. You talked about it being stable. Is that due to less runoff of the existing book or is that due to more willingness for you guys to actually put on new loans?","Scott McLean","Ken, this is Scott. We have done some new underwriting in midstream and in the upstream. But the services portfolio, just the payoffs in general, have slowed. And -- but I would note that you just go back 18 months, to the end of 2015, services -- the energy services loan outstandings are about -- they're down about 40% from that time period. And that's basically because the -- most -- about 2\/3 of that portfolio is term loans that have been amortizing and certainly charge-offs have had an impact on it too, but that's far less impact than basic amortization. So some new underwriting in midstream and upstream and then just a slowing in paydowns, in an appropriate slowing in paydowns, is what I would say. We're seeing revolver usage start to pick back up again, as the rig count is almost doubled -- it's not quite doubled in the last year, but nearly doubled.","Kenneth Zerbe","Got it. Okay. Helpful. And then, just a question for Paul on the tax rate. If I heard right, I think you said your guidance over the next 4 quarters was 34% to 35%. But you don't -- I guess, how we should we think about the first quarter stock-based accounting change that flows through the tax rate in the first quarter? I presume that, that would actually happen again next first quarter, correct?","Paul Burdiss","Right. Well, look, it's the -- maybe. Not necessarily. It is the next 4 quarters, as you point out. The -- that impact is dependent upon the strike price of the equity-based compensation when it was issued and the kind of prevailing stock price at the time. So what I thought I said and what I intended to say was that excluding the effect of that accounting kind of guidance on stock-based compensation, we expect the tax rate to be 34% to 35%. And the reason -- yes, 34%, 35%. But the reason is that it's really hard for me to predict what that kind of accounting guidance figure is going to be. Hopefully that makes sense.","Kenneth Zerbe","Got it. No, it does. So the base rate is 34% in first quarter of next year and then we subtract whatever percentage due to where your stock is at the time. Okay, I think I understand that.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, it was intended -- the outlook was intended to exclude that accounting guidance piece, because it's a little hard to predict.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","On the loan growth and on the commercial side, I'm just trying to get a better feel of how much of that is a pickup in demand, where you're seeing pipelines better and maybe CapEx driving growth and everything, versus anything you're changing? Because there a real notable pickup in growth here and then I'm just curious if any of that is pricing or any change in your willingness to lend in any way?","James Abbott","If I might just jump in and get started, John, real quick and then kick it to others but -- and this is James. The origination volume that we did in the second quarter of '17 was almost exactly identical to what we did in the second quarter of '16. The big difference was really in the prior quarter. In the first quarter of 2017, we saw probably about $700 million less origination volume than we had in previous first quarters and we don't have a fabulous explanation for that. But we and the rest of the industry, all had the same problem. And -- so I think that it was more of an anomaly of what was going on in the first quarter than what we've seen in the second quarter.","Michael Morris","And this is Michael. I'll add that demand probably has picked up a little bit. It's probably a combination of demand in process improvement, but not really expanding the underwriting box.","Scott McLean","And we certainly haven't changed our pricing perspective as well, either. We're maintaining the same pricing approach as we've had in recent years.","John Pancari","Okay. That's helpful. And to James, your point -- admittedly though, the third quarter and fourth quarter '16 was pretty much flattish on EOP total loans' total and C&I was a little bit sluggish there as well. So, I guess, it's more of a pickup versus just last quarter but over the prior couple of quarters as well.","James Abbott","That's right.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then one other follow-up is, around your guidance fee, the -- your expense guidance base that you're going off of, is that, does that base exclude the FDIC $3 million impact in the second quarter?","Paul Burdiss","The outlook -- the 2% to 3% is -- right, it does not. It's -- what we're intending to demonstrate is the sort of adjusted expenses which we're using for the efficiency ratio. So it does exclude things like reserve, [indiscernible] lending commitments. And you can see, at the back of our press release, we've got a schedule of GAAP to non-GAAP reconcilement. And you can see the things that we're including and excluding in that.","John Pancari","Okay. Though I guess, I'll just look at the next 12-month guidance, of up slightly to moderately increasing and I'm just wondering if that is off of the second quarter number where you take out the FDIC loss share impact.","James Abbott","Yes, John, if you think of the -- so it was $399 million on an adjusted noninterest expense which is in the tables in the back. If you subtract out the revenue sharing with the FDIC which is about $3 million, you're asking is, is it off of that base, of $396 million? And the answer is no. It's just off of the $399 million.","Paul Burdiss","And the reason, John, is that, that expense also comes with revenue, right? And so we're focused on operating leverage. And as you know, efficiency ratio is just a kind of a handy way to get at our intent which is positive operating leverage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Just as a follow-up to Geoffrey Elliott's line of questioning. So in the treasury white paper, there seems to be a lot of proposals that could directly address some of the constraints directly related to Zions which has been CCAR, small business and CRE, as it relates to both CCAR and regulation. And I'm just wondering, I think the message is very clear to your shareholders that your risk management has significantly tightened since the crisis voluntarily. I'm wondering though, if you could give us a sense of what is the gap between what's driven by regulatory regime and what you think is prudent in terms of how you're running your business. So you clearly got a line of questioning on CET1 levels, but I'm wondering strategically, what could change if we do get red reform in Washington?","Harris Simmons","Let me, this is Harris, let me start off here. I think the -- a primary benefit, if we saw some red reform that provided greater transparency in the CCAR process for that to change the threshold so that we weren't subject to the process in the first place, would be with respect to the, just the complicated capital management regime that CCAR, that is now known as Horizontal Capital Review, is creating. I don't think it changed fundamentally the way that we're doing risk management around things like concentrations. It may give us a little more, incrementally more room, because we don't have sort of this unknown constraint hanging out there. But listen, we recognize that we're probably deep into a credit cycle that there are particular pieces of the CRE segment that everybody needs to be careful about, retail being one of them. We've been, I think, pretty disciplined around multifamily over the last year or 2 and will continue to be. So I mean, we're thinking about those kinds of things independently of the regulatory regime. But it would simply remove some of the -- a couple of, sort of artificial constraints, particularly on the way we manage the capital piece of it, so. That's how I would think about it. Anybody else have thoughts?","Erika Najarian","And just maybe a follow-up there. What kind of liquidity -- or what changes in the balance sheet composition could happen if the liquidity coverage ratio was no longer applicable to Zions?","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. Under Dodd-Frank Reg YY, we're also constrained by maintaining a 30-day coverage, coverage of 30-day cash outflows. That's actually more constraining for us, as it is for many banks of our size, than the modified LCR. So if the kind of LCR just sort of evaporates, frankly I don't think it's going to affect us too much. And I will also say, this kind of 30-day cash outflow thing is really kind of a proxy for liquidity stress testing. And we have, all the banks, have significantly changed our risk management practices generally. And specifically, in liquidity, not unlike what's gone on in interest rate risk for the last several decades, liquidity risk is now really being measured and defined by stress testing and that's what we're doing. So I would not see -- I would not expect to see, even if Dodd-Frank went away, I would not expect to see a measurable change in the balance sheet composition as it relates to liquidity because we're all just really focused on stronger balance sheets today than we have been in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Maybe to follow up on Erica's question. Harris, I saw you testify in front of the Senate Bank Committee last month. After the time you spent in Washington, what's your level of optimism for the potential of the $50 billion threshold getting lifted?","Harris Simmons","Well, as you saw, there's some opposition to it.","Steven Alexopoulos","I did see that.","Harris Simmons","Nevertheless, there is a fair amount of consensus that the $50 billion threshold, as I tried to note -- I mean, there's a lot of consensus that the number is wrong. And I'd like to be optimistic about the fact that ultimately, that common sense and good policy will win out over politics. But right now, the politics are pretty -- are reasonably daunting. I think that it could take a little while -- I mean, the bill that I refer to as the Luetkemeyer bill, passed the House in December and it would have eliminated the $50 billion, replaced it with basically a systemic risk index. That bill has been reintroduced, so the effort is on to re-sign cosponsors, et cetera. And the question is whether this can be done, is kind of a rifle shot as opposed to part of a larger bill. And it's unclear to me, given the dynamics around -- I think what's happened with health care probably muddies the water a little bit. There's just more blood in the water than there probably, than we would have hoped for. So it could take a little bit of time. But I think ultimately, it will happen, just because people, including former Fed Governor Tarullo, Janet Yellen, I mean, there's some credible voices from kind of center-left, if you will, agreeing that there's a better way to do this. So I don't know when it'll happen, but I remain optimistic that it will happen.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's good color. And if I could just ask, Scott, looking at the loan growth detail, why are you not seeing better C&I growth out of the Zions Bank sub?","Harris Simmons","Michael, do you want to...","Michael Morris","Sure, I mean -- well, the Zions Bank MSAs is really your Salt Lake City and Boise, those are the big MSAs. And we're seeing most of the loan growth come from our larger population bases in MSAs, like various parts of Texas outside of Houston, actually. And really good, solid loan growth in California bank and trust C&I portfolio. So that might be one of the reasons we're not seeing stronger growth. I mean, Zions First National Bank, obviously has a great presence in the Salt Lake and Boise markets and communities, but we're just seeing stronger loan growth in deeper MSAs and population bases for now.","James Abbott","Yes, I don't know that I have a simple answer to that. But it's certainly something that we're pushing, but it didn't show up here. You saw it in some other pockets on C&I this quarter, but C&I was a little bit slow here. I don't know what the answer is.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible] of Katcha Investments.","Unidentified Analyst","My quick question is, in most of the markets you're in, the area really is on fire. We're 9 months in this expansion and most of the markets that you're in, the unemployment rate's somewhere in the 4s. Do you see some nice upside from here? Or are we sort of reaching a top in just available labor and the ability of the economy in those areas to expand?","Harris Simmons","I might just say that we talked to, I think, last quarter about some of the things we've done to kind of reengineer processes for small business loans. And we think that, that's starting to take hold and we'd done something similar with middle-market kinds of credits, loans from kind of $3 million up to $10 million or $20 million in size. And we had a call this morning with a lot of our relationship managers and credit officers going through a variety of process simplification kind of items that we think will make it easier for them just to get deals done without compromising credit quality, doesn't change the size of the credit box, if you will. But it just makes it easier for them to get across the goal line. And I think that, that's -- I really think that going to help on the margin. It doesn't feel like anything is really slowing down in the economies around the West. And so, I'm reasonably optimistic that we could see, for the coming 4 quarters, a pretty good business environment for lending. There's still a lot of cash out there. I think if there's -- if there's anything that's really hindering loan demand, it's probably the amount of cash that companies have piled up and if they'll start spending it, it will help a lot.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?","James Abbott","Thank you very much for joining the conference call today to discuss the results. We look forward to seeing you at a conference sometime soon or at the next earnings call out in October. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please go ahead.","James Abbott","Thank you, Abigail, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2016 first quarter earnings.","Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at ZionsBancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer section. We ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thank you very much, James, and we want to welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our first quarter results. I'm going to talk about some information on the accompanying slides, just some opening comments here.","On Slide 3 are some highlights for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is a result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted net interest expense levels that are in line with our stated expense initiatives.","Another item that appears to be an emerging trend in the last six months is stronger loan growth. In the first quarter, loans increased at an annualized rate of 7.6%, accelerating from the prior quarter's rate of 5.3%. It was one of the best first quarter growth rates Zions has posted in the last decade. We achieved positive operating leverage for the third consecutive quarter and we're tracking well on the efficiency initiative that we announced last summer, with the efficiency ratio falling to 68.5%.","Although there will be much discussion about energy lending on this call, which only comprises about 6% of our loan portfolio, the other 94% of our loan portfolio continues to perform extremely well, and energy is a manageable situation for us. Of note, although the earnings per share only increased $0.01 per share over the prior year period, the change in the provision for credit losses between those two quarters is equal to about $0.12 per share. So, although energy concerns will be with us for 2016, that effect is fairly transitory compared to the improving trend in underlying financial performance over the course of the last year.","If we turn to Slide 4, our pre-provision net revenue has improved by 21% over the past year. This positive operating leverage has been driven by holding adjusted non-interest expense growth of 2.5%, while adjusted revenue has increased nearly 8% over the same period. We expect to continue to post continued strong momentum in this area over the next couple of years.","On Slide 5 we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the fourth quarter we experienced an acceleration in the first quarter with loans held for investment increasing, as previously noted, 7.6% annualized, after posting a healthy 5.3% annualized growth rate in the prior quarter. We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth, specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans.","Deposits declined modestly, about 1%, from the prior quarter, which is somewhat common for a first quarter for us, and the year-over-year improvement of 3.7% is similar to the performance in first quarters over the, approximately, the last decade.","Moving to Slide 6, we're well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio to 66% or better for the full year 2016. We're encouraged with the improvement from the prior quarter to 68.5% in the first quarter, which included a couple of significant seasonal expense items.","Advancing to Slide 7, excluding energy loans, credit quality is really solid across the Company by various loan types and geographies. Total classified loans increased to 3.7% from 3.4% in the prior quarter, but aside from energy, classified loans declined slightly to 2% of total loans.","Non-performing assets, expressed as a percentage of loans and OREO, increased to 1.3% from 0.9% in the prior quarter. However, if one excludes energy credits, the non-performing asset to loan ratio is only 0.7%.","On the topic of losses, substantially all the losses in the first quarter were attributable to energy loans. We'll have some further discussion on that later. But the takeaway here is that the energy situation is quite manageable and the overall provision and loss rates remain in line with industry averages.","On Slide 8, this is a repeat of a slide we produced for our Investor Day back in February, but it helps to visually show the various initiatives that we're tracking to help improve the operating performance of the Company. I'm pleased with the progress made in several of these areas in a relatively short period of time, and most initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and timelines.","Similarly, Slide 9 has a summary of the key financial performance metrics that we are targeting and we feel very good about the progress we've made and expect that, with continued discipline, that we'll meet or exceed these goals.","With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris. I'll begin on Slide 10.","For the first quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $79 million or $0.38 per share. Relative to the fourth quarter, net interest income increased about $4 million. Adjusted for fourth quarter recoveries of interest income and income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased $17 million or about 4% on a linked-quarter basis. Customer related fees, which is the bulk of non-interest income, were flat to the fourth quarter and improved about 7% from the first quarter of 2015.","At just less than $400 million, non-interest expense was slightly lower in the first quarter when compared to the fourth quarter. However, there were several notable items impacting both quarters.","First, on salaries and employee benefits. The first quarter included $6 million related to equity grants to retirement eligible employees and $7 million in seasonal payroll taxes, while the fourth quarter included an incentive compensation accrual reversal of $5 million. Additionally, as noted on the fourth quarter earnings call, fourth quarter non-interest expenses included elevated levels of FDIC loss-sharing expense and an elevated legal accrual. We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our costs of doing business, our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted non-interest expenses at less than $1.6 billion for 2016.","Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, as we conveyed at February's Investor Day, we increased our allowance for credit losses in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, reflective of continued stress in our oil and gas portfolio. As we progressed through 2016, we currently expect quarterly provisions to be roughly consistent with first quarter results. A key driver of this outlook is overall market conditions, including the level of volatility of energy prices. Scott will provide more detail on our energy portfolio in just a moment.","Slide 11 outlines our recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the first quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was about 8.5% -- was up about 8.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. On a linked-quarter basis, net interest income was up at an annualized rate of just under 4%. When controlling [ph] for the $13 million of elevated FDIC related revenues and interest income recoveries reported in the fourth quarter of 2015. The linked-quarter growth rate is closer to 15%.","This recent rate of growth in net interest income, while not sustainable over the long term, reflects our focus on improving the profitability of our balance sheet and has been significantly helped by strong loan growth, the movement of cash, the high-quality liquid investments, the maturities of higher-cost wholesale funds, and December's federal funds target rate increase.","Looking ahead, net interest income is expected to increase throughout 2016 as loan growth and active management of the investment portfolio impact the size and mix of earning assets. Importantly, our performance objectives assumed a 25-basis-point increase in the federal funds target rate in December of 2016. We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates as shown in the box at the bottom right of Slide 11.","Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high-quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the first quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent, high-quality, liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rules.","Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in baseline and downside economic environments when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the first quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $1.3 billion on average when compared to the fourth quarter. This average balanced growth was influenced by the $1.1 billion point-to-point increase in available-for-sale securities, as well as the continued impact of purchases we made in the prior quarter.","We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet sensitivity, interest rate sensitivity, as we purchased fixed-rate investments, and with respect to duration extension risk inherent in the investment [ph] portfolio. The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over three years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is about 2.6 years today. And if rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 3.1 years.","On Page 13 we break down year-over-year loan growth in a slightly different format than we have utilized previously. The size of the bubbles on this chart represents loan portfolio size, while the position against the vertical axis represents year-over-year growth. As shown, Zions is generally growing where we want to grow, while owner-occupied C&I and residential mortgage remain opportunities for additional growth. Compared to the prior quarter, period-end loans grew 7% on an annualized basis, with particular strength in C&I and term CRE. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth while maintaining our underwriting standards.","There are four loan classes that have been in decline this past year or more, and the most substantial rate of decline are in the national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio, each declining approximately 16% from the prior year-ago period.","The national real estate portfolio represents about 5% of loans and the attrition here has resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point of the overall growth of a loan portfolio during the past year. We have indicated that we expected the rate of attrition to taper, and that is beginning to happen, recently declining an annualized $276 million as compared to the year-over-year decline of $215 million.","On energy, as we move through the spring redetermination on upstream energy products [ph], we expect pay-downs due to reduced borrowing basis.","To summarize, our outlook for loan growth for the next 12 months is for an increasing portfolio, which should be in the mid-single-digit rate of growth range.","Another key component of net interest income, which is the rate or yields of the portfolio and loan production, can be found on Slide 14. The slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which declined 10 basis points from the prior quarter to average 4.14%. As described in the press release, the prior-quarter container recovery of interest income of about $8 million included in the fourth quarter loan yield, as well as elevated income from FDIC supported loans. Excluding these two factors, the yield on the loan portfolio increased somewhat from the prior quarter, lifted by the increase in benchmark rates. However, older loans that were booked at wider spreads are regularly maturing and continued to place slight pressure on loan yields.","The securities portfolio improved slightly this quarter, largely due to the changing composition of the portfolio as we add new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk, as well as the increased rates that affected our floating rate securities. At the bottom of the chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percentage of earning assets, which continues to be quite low and was stable relative to the prior quarter.","The net interest margin increased to 3.35% in the first quarter, a 12-basis-point increase from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the ongoing shift in earning asset composition to a higher concentration of loans and securities and a lower concentration of cash.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss our fee income initiative, as well as provide additional detail about our energy portfolio. Scott?","Scott McLean","Thank you, Paul. On Slide 15 we're pleased to report the continued strength in fee income growth. Because of the seasonality of the results, we think the year-over-year comparison is more relevant. Through the hard work of our employees, we were able to increase customer-related fee income by 7% over the year-ago period. These results have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification of the expense associated with rewards programs such as cash-back from the non-interest expense category to net against our card revenue, which was done to align our accounting approach to be more comparable to the majority of banks within the industry.","The areas experiencing the most significant growth in fee -- in customer fees included loan fees, which increased nearly $4 million or 38% from the year-ago period, to equal [ph] $14 million in the first quarter of 2016. Bank card fees increased more than $2 million or 17% to equal nearly $18 million. Treasury management is our largest category of customer related fee income, which increased 3% from the year-ago period to equal about $35 million. Relative to the prior quarter, we experienced an increase in dividends, although there was a valuation adjustment to one of our investments that adversely affected dividends by about $2 million.","Transitioning to energy now, obviously is of significant concern to many investors and it's an all-hands-on-deck effort here at Zions to do as much as possible obviously to protect the value of both the principal and the interest of our loans at the same time demonstrating our long-term commitment to our customers.","Before we dive in to the numbers though, let me first address something that is the subject of much discussion on the earnings conference calls of other banks with energy exposure, the Shared National Credit Exam results. As you know, this is a regulatory exam and is subject to disclosure restrictions. We have incorporated the vast majority of the results of the Shared National Credit Exam in our first quarter results. And we've incorporated all of the results, the financial results of the quarter would not be materially different.","Our grading methodology has been and continues to be consistent with regulatory guidance. As you may know, the Shared National Credit Exam is not final. Some grades of loans where we are a participant bank are in their appeal period. Obviously we downgrade credits based upon the Shared National Credit results where applicable. But if the Shared National Credit results are better than our internal grade, we leave the internal grade in place. So, as investors looking at our financial condition, you're getting a very conservative view of the portfolio.","Let me move now to Slide 16. As you can see, our energy loan outstandings, and also from the material in the press release, increased $21 million from the prior quarter, with declines in the services portfolio, offset by some new underwriting and upstream, midstream and downstream, and a handful of defensive draws. Of course, energy loan commitments and balances are down substantially from a year-ago period and we do expect further attrition as we move through the borrowing base redetermination process. We're about 40% through the spring re-determination and we anticipate the average borrowing base of a client to decline by about 12% to 15% relative to the fall redetermination.","Also on Slide 16, as you can see on the right side of the slide and the chart on Page 4 of the press release, classified energy loan balances increased by $194 million from the prior quarter to equal 27% of outstanding balances, and non-accrual loans increased by $220 million from the prior quarter to equal 10.8% of loan balances. The increase in both categories was evenly weighted between upstream loans and services: loans to energy services companies. The primary driver of these increases had to do with the severity of the commodity price volatility early in the quarter, a flattening of the NYMEX strip, and a continued uncertain outlook.","Turning to Slide 17, we are displaying some new information here to help investors better understand the nature of our unfunded oil and gas commitments. We have just under $400 million of unfunded loan commitments in the criticize category or just under 20% of total commitments. However, and this is very important, about one-half of that $400 million is unavailable to the borrower for various reasons, including borrowing-based restrictions, covenant breaches, or anti-hoarding provisions. During the quarter we experienced six loans that did draw up on their lines, equaling about $55 million of balances, again not something we're happy to see but it is manageable, and as a senior secured lender, we feel good about our loss severity in the event that there is a default on any of these loans.","Moving on to Slide 18, it may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of our criticized and classified energy loans, and even non-accrual loans, are still current on their payments. Only 9% of non-accrual loans are past due.","Moving to Slide 19, as we all know, in the first quarter there was significant oil and gas price volatility. This volatility, combined with continuing rigorous credit-by-credit review and our top-down regression models, is leaving us to update our outlook for energy loan losses. More specifically, if oil were to hover in the mid-30s area, we currently expect losses in 2016 to be in the $100 million area. Recall, our prior outlook was for a range of $75 million to $100 million for the year. Clearly, prices today are above the mid-$30 range level. However, we always want to be prepared for lower prices. During the second quarter we will be closely monitoring the results of the spring reserve-based redetermination and the actions being taken by our private equity sponsors to better inform our full-year energy loss outlook.","We continue to build our energy loss reserve to a level of $214 million, or more than 8% of energy balances. This is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.","I'm sure we'll have questions about energy lending, but let me step back and look at the objectives we're working towards as a Company. On Slide 20, this is a summary of several items we articulated at our recent Investor Day. We are fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage. And I think at this point, with more than 20% year-over-year growth and PPNR [ph], we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and the upgrading of our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit, customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back-office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, and many additional advantages.","Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we -- than what can be seen today. And we are tracking well against these goals as discussed earlier. Regarding returns of capital, it is premature to discuss capital returns opportunities as we are awaiting the results of the 2016 CCAR. However, we aspire to have a much higher return of capital than experienced in the recent past.","Finally, we're absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgement that our commitment to doing business locally really is a strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research. As you know, we received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank in the United States. And we are only one of four banks that have performed at industry-leading levels since the initiation of this survey.","Paul, with that, I'll turn the call back over to you to conclude.","Paul Burdiss","Thanks, Scott. Slide 22 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are adjusting our loan outlook to increasing, due primarily to factors already discussed in earlier comments.","We expect net interest income to increase from the first quarter level as continued growth of loans and investment securities offset possible pressure on loan pricing. Our outlook does not include the effect of the any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect to benefit to an annual net interest income of about $75 million to $135 million for each 100-basis-point increase in rates. That's particularly focused on the short end of the curve.","We expect a quarterly provision for loan lease losses in 2016 that is roughly consistent with the provision taken in the first quarter of 2016, assuming current market conditions. This incorporates the maintenance of a strong reserve ratio on energy loans, although we expect energy loan balances to continue the declining trend.","We expect that non-interest income, excluding dividends and securities gains and losses will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area. As stated previously, we have committed to holding non-interest expenses to less than $1.6 billion for 2016 excluding severance and restructuring expenses.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than the normal quarterly run rate, which was facilitated in part from the consolidation of our banking charters. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 35% for the full year of 2016.","We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. As noted last quarter, the preferred tender completed in the fourth quarter will reduced preferred dividends by approximately $10 million in 2016 versus 2015. I expect that you have noticed the preferred tender announced today along with this earnings release. This action if successful is expected to reduce our run rate preferred dividends to an annual level of roughly $45 million.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Abigail, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. First question I had. Just in terms of the provision expense. Totally understand that your guidance is for stable the first quarter. First quarter is probably a little bit higher than what I think some people may have been expecting. But help us understand why the provision expense should stay higher given oil has made a pretty sharp improvement from $30 to, call it, the low $40 range. It seems that things should be getting better for your energy portfolio, not necessarily worse.","Scott McLean","Ken, this is Scott. Thank you for the question. You know, if you look back at the price of oil and gas that, as we entered the quarter and then even throughout February, it's a very dynamic process, and it's just been in the last 30 days, including the first part of this quarter, that we've seen this rally. And so we're grading loans dynamically, we're evaluating the reserve dynamically. And we just -- it was such a punitive first quarter when you -- from an oil and gas price volatility standpoint, particularly the price of natural gas. The decline there was a fairly new event. And we just felt like the most important thing we could do would be to prepare for those first quarter oil and gas market conditions to continue.","As it's turned out, they've not. The last 30 days we've seen a really nice rebound in oil and natural gas prices.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Understood, but I guess phrased a different way, if oil stays at $42, you still feel very -- and you know that for a fact, would you still guide for a provision expense equal to first quarter?","Harris Simmons","I think -- Ken, this is Harris. I think I'd just say that we're trying to be conservative and, listen, we know that this isn't going to be smooth through the quarters. We've tried to be helpful and giving a little bit of additional guidance in terms of what we think the losses in the portfolio are going to be, so I think that, you know, I think we're still comfortable with their kind of $100 million range this year. And could it come in better than the first quarter? Sure. That is going to, you know, I think bounce the other way too. But that's just kind of our best thinking in terms of where we think losses are going to be and trying to be conservative in terms of what we think could be out there in terms of continued pressure on the reserve if prices remained volatile and things don't continue to heal.","Scott McLean","I would also say, in a market like this, you really, you know, we have visibility maybe three to five months out, but we don't have clear visibility all the way to the end of the year, even if prices were to stay at $40. And so I just -- that's why we're going to err on the side of being conservative.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, understood. And just in terms of loan growth, I think it sounded like your guidance was a little bit stronger than what it was last quarter. Does that reflect an improvement in your expectations for future quarters or does your new loan growth guidance just simply reflects the stronger you had in the first quarter?","Harris Simmons","Well, I think, you know, and this quite ties into the -- your first question with respect to provisions, I mean, the kind of loan growth we're going to, you know, that we've been experiencing also was -- is going to be a factor in thinking about provisions, so it's not just energy. But it's -- loan growth for us has been a little bit of a fickle kind of a thing the last several quarters. What we can tell you is that we have seen quite a lot of consistency over the last six months and so far what we're seeing into the second quarter is encouraging. But it's hard to extrapolate that out very far.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open.","Tim Hayes - FBR Capital Markets","Hey guys. It's Tim Hayes for Paul Miller.","Are you seeing any second derivative [ph] from energy? Is this -- is it flowing through to CRE or any other industries and any of your geographies?","Harris Simmons","We'll have Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer, speak to that.","Michael Morris","So we're tracking both CRE and consumer very closely. We initiated the same kind of heightened supervision and loan level ground-up analysis of the CRE and the consumer portfolios, and we aren't seeing large noticeable shifts or negative migration patterns. We are especially watchful of our multi-family portfolio in Houston, and we are seeing some rent concessions for longer-term leases. And so that has somewhat of an effect on net effective rents and NOI. But most of our properties are absorbing quite nicely, and office, there is some risk there, but the loan sizes are not significant and the underwriting is very solid with 50% to 55% loan to cost on some of the construction loans where they were done on a little bit of a speculative basis. And we have great sponsors there. And so we have quite a bit of comfort.","If we see migration in the CRE book, it will mostly be in the past grade ranges, with maybe a few outliers that go to [inaudible].","Scott McLean","I would just add to that, Michael mentioned our office exposure in Houston, but the two -- the only two-spec office buildings we had totaled $36 million. One of them now is experiencing leasing and the other actually was put to bed with the long-term amortization as well. So we don't believe our office exposure is going to be material, although we do have exposure there.","I would just comment also that you really have to look at our CRE exposure in Texas relative to what we had in 2008. We have about $1 billion less in total CRE exposure today than we had in 2008. We have significantly pivoted from construction lending to CRE term there, and you can see that in our numbers. We have virtually no Land A and B [ph] and we had close to a billion dollars of it going into the '08 downturn that was principally because, when you did construction loans, then you generally finance phase two and phase three land.","And then the final point is that we -- the amount of equity that has gone in to office, multi-family, particularly, is almost double what it was in the cycle leading up to 2008. So, a lot of factors that are very different today than the last cycle we went through.","Michael Morris","And Scott, I would only add that, with respect to the consumer portfolio knock on risks there, I would point to Slide 26, which is this surveillance that we have on high oil and gas employment counties and we monitor FICOs, we refresh FICOs every two months, and we haven't seen any negative migration or blips in either FICOs or delinquency rates in consumable.","Tim Hayes - FBR Capital Markets","Great. Thanks for the color. And one more question for me. On margin. Just assuming that rates were to stay where they are today for the remainder of the year, how much more room is there to run with just converting lower-yielding assets to loans? And will this support NIM expansion for the rest of the year?","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. Thank you for your question. I expect, you know, while we continue to fight loan pricing, I expect that the opportunity to redeploy cash into investment securities and loans will, at a minimum hold the net interest margin stable and perhaps could allow some modest expansion.","Tim Hayes - FBR Capital Markets","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Hey, good afternoon.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hello.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Hey, Paul, just to follow up on the last question, in terms of maybe the amount of remixing that you think you [inaudible] to do, just kind of curious, the overall size of the balance sheet, going forward, will we start to see that grow or do you think it kind of stays stable and you continue to remix?","Paul Burdiss","I'd say our current plan is for a relatively stable size of the balance sheet, although I'll say by the time we get to the end of the year it's conceivable that the balance sheet could start to modestly grow. As you know, we've provided outlooks previously on the amount of growth that we expect in the investment portfolio throughout the year, which is kind of roughly probably, from here on out, kind of between $750 million and a billion dollars a quarter. So, depending on deposit growth and depending on our cash position, you could see us either adjust that or adjust the size of the balance sheet moving forward.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Okay, great. And then just one quick follow-up on energy. Just curious if you guys could maybe give us a breakdown of the $100 million or so of expected losses. How would that break down between sort of E&P and service?","Scott McLean","Sure. It's probably going to be 70% -- 60%, 70%, oilfield service and the remainder reserve-based.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill","Great. That's all. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Unidentified Participant","Hey guys. This is Josh in for Ken. You saw a nice jump in securities yield this quarter, and can you just speak to roll-off versus new money yields and whether you -- whether there are any one-time helpers this quarter you note?","Paul Burdiss","I would note, the biggest -- one of the biggest one-time helpers this quarter is that about 25% of that available-for-sale portfolio is floating rate [inaudible] so we saw a benefit this quarter related to that. As far as the rest, you know, we continue to try to be measured as we think about the, as noted in my comments, the types of bonds we're putting out and the yields with those bonds. So, clearly, the shape of the curve, looking ahead, the shape of the curve will clearly affect the yield of those bonds coming on.","Unidentified Participant","Okay. And then just shifting gears, could you speak to how much more opportunity there could be in tendering for additional preferred in debt?","Paul Burdiss","Well, the tendering question is difficult because, as you know, kind of the more you go after these bonds, the more difficult, they become hard to find. So in our capital plan, in 2015, we had a $3 million tender for preferred, which the announcement today kind of rounds that out for that $300 million, and there's a capital issue and subject to CCAR, I'm really not at liberty to discuss incremental plans with respect to preferred redemptions.","Unidentified Participant","Great. Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari - Evercore","Good afternoon guys.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hi, John.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hi, John.","John Pancari - Evercore","But to the $100 million loss expectation, could you just give me a little bit more detail on how you got that or why the change. I'm not sure I really get it. You were previously at 75 to 100 if oil remained at $30. What specifically made you bring that higher with oil here at 40 bucks?","Scott McLean","Right. This is similar to Ken's question I think in the sense that we, you know, that estimate really is based on our concern about the volatility of the price of oil in January and February and the decline in the price of natural gas. So -- and you may think, well, gee, that was the end of February and now we're in April, but we just -- we don't really pivot that fast and we, you know, that was pretty troubling what we saw in January and February and it could return. We've seen $40 before. We saw it coming down. And so now we're seeing it going up. But we could be back at $30 again. So we're just -- prefer to err on a more conservative side.","I would also say on the -- as it relates to oilfield service, the longer this goes, which it's going to go, you know, even if prices improve, there is general understanding in the industry that the oilfield companies will not come back as quickly as the E&P companies do, there are a lot of reasons for that, and so we feel pretty confident that oilfield service will be under considerable stress for the remainder of this year and a fair amount of next year.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. All right, thanks.","Scott McLean","\u2026where reserve-based E&P companies may see nice rebound in the second half of the year, we don't think that's going to translate through to oilfield service nearly as quickly.","John Pancari - Evercore","Right. Okay. All right. And then separately, on the margin, just wanted to get a little bit of additional color on how much the Fed hike actually benefited your loan yields. You know, if you adjust for the FDIC loan impact as well as the loan recoveries that you have had previously in fourth quarter and you adjust for that, by my math, I guess loan yields were up about 3 basis points, is that all that you would expect from the Fed to help your loan yields or is there more coming?","Harris Simmons","Yeah. You know, that -- as you know, predicting the net interest margin could be really difficult. There are a lot of countervailing things here. Obviously the Federal Reserve rate increase helped us. But as you remember and as we disclosed on our Investor Day, we provided some incremental disclosures around kind of the sensitivity of earning assets to changes in rate.","And one of the things I would point out is that we continue to have some level of loans, particularly prime-based loans, that are floored, and so they, for example, because they are at floor rate, would not have enjoyed the kind of the dollar-for-dollar, basis-point-for-basis-point increase with the Fed. And so that, you know, and we've also got some swaps on the book.","So those things combined with I would say continued pricing pressure kind of led to that overall net yield improvement.","John Pancari - Evercore","Okay. All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Long with Raymond James. Your line is open.","David Long - Raymond James","Good afternoon guys.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hey.","David Long - Raymond James","Hey, Paul, can you just confirm, in your 12-month outlook, did you say that assumes no change in short-term rates?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah, I did. We've got in our performance objectives, as we look into 2017, you may recall that we've got an assumption that the target rate for the Fed Funds would increase in December of 2016. But as a practical matter, we're looking ahead for 2016, we do not have another rate increase in there.","David Long - Raymond James","Okay. And then my second question, regarding the loan recoveries, you said it was $13 million or so in the fourth quarter. Does that mean you didn't have any of that in the first quarter? And how do you expect that to move through the rest of this year?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah, it was interest recoveries, and there were a couple of items. One was income associated with our FDIC assisted loans and also interest income recoveries from loan recoveries. And those totaled $13 million, different kind of quarter to quarter.","As it looks -- as it relates to the remainder of the year, that's not the kind of thing that I would expect to see. And so our outlook would not include any of that.","David Long - Raymond James","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Hi there, it's Geoff Elliott from Autonomous Research. Thank you for taking the question.","Just a quick numbers type question, could you break out the provision between energy and non-energy, just for the quarter? Because I'm kind of confused looking at the increase in reserves from 5% to 8% on a $2.6 billion balance of energy loans plus the $36 million of energy-related charge-offs? I'd have thought with that quantum of increase in reserves, the provision would have been higher. So I'm guess there must have been a release elsewhere.","James Abbott","Geoff, I'll -- this is James Abbott, I'll just give you a quick thought, is that we -- one of the things -- one of the things that we did take a look at is our reserve for unfunded lending commitment, so let me start with that, and we made some fine-tuning adjustments based on the way we compute the reserve on that, particularly for smaller business customers that are less than $750,000 in size. So that was part of that allowance for credit losses in the overall portfolio balance.","And then we -- the reserve for loans, excluding the energy loan portfolio, which is $2.6 billion. But excluding that, we'd have a reserve to loan ratio of about 1.2% on that book of business. And that would compare to no net charge-offs in the quarter on that portfolio and would also compare to about 70 basis points of non-accrual loans. So it's really pretty strong reserve relative to the current credit quality positioning at that and it's just continued to get better and better, so there's not as much support as there was two or three years ago for keeping that reserve level higher.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","And then just to follow up, in the release you used the world stellar to describe the non-energy credit, which is pretty forceful language, so, can you talk about what's so stellar about it?","Harris Simmons","Well, that we're seeing essentially no charge-offs, not just this quarter, but I mean we're seeing kind of a pattern of that. We're seeing delinquency rates. Almost any major of that, remainder of the portfolio, is looking about as strong as we've seen it right now, about as strong as we've seen it for a very long time.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Eads with UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads - UBS","Hi, good afternoon.","Looking at Slide 27 where you give loan growth kind of in great detail, the growth in energy was really, really strong, and just curious if you could give a little color on kind of what the outlook there is in Texas, and then maybe if you have detail on how should the growth came in Houston versus the other parts of the state.","Scott McLean","Yeah. This is Scott. There was one large credit that was done there, it was a corporate credit, had nothing to do with energy, had nothing to do really with Texas economy. And it's a large 20-year client of the bank that we were able to move a transaction out of one of the global banks, they were at the end of a syndications process and the loan will pay down pretty quickly actually, will have about half of it amortized by the end of this year, if I remember correctly.","They are seeing moderate growth in middle market and one to four-family mortgages, so, middle market commercial lending and one to four-family mortgages, and a portion of this real estate portfolio funded just basically related to construction -- the construction portfolio.","David Eads - UBS","All right -- yeah, go ahead.","Scott McLean","And in terms of the outlook, they're -- having gone through these declines before down there, they are -- their risk filters are very well-tuned and have been quite frankly for about two years, but there's a lot of good market share movement that will go on during a period like this. It happens in most other periods like this. And so there will be opportunity.","There will also be energy underwriting that'll take place, as the stressed assets are purchased by new acquirers and as companies are put together, merged, so there will be new energy underwriting that probably will begin to manifest itself in the second half of the year.","David Eads - UBS","Maybe just to follow up on that, can you just kind of talk about, if that happens, what your appetite would be for taking on new energy loans right at this part of the cycle?","Scott McLean","Well, I would say that our appetite would be, you know, totally based on the normal credit underwriting criteria with again our full risk filters on. But if you were going to underwrite a reserve-based oil and gas transaction, today would be a moderately good time to do that. And so there will be good transactions that have presented themselves and will present themselves.","On the oilfield service side, I would say the odds of that happening are much lower. We certainly will not ascribe much value to borrowing, you know, the borrowing basis, etcetera, etcetera, and the equity levels would be very high. The kind of financing we do there would probably generally be receivable-based more than anything else. But the new underwritings in energy will be more reserve-based and midstream than anything else.","David Eads - UBS","Right. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining-Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","Thank you. I want to ask a little bit about expenses just to change the subject a little bit. Personnel expenses were about 60% of the composition and year over year it grew about 6%. About half of that was related to I think moving those retirement-based awards up one quarter, so we're still seeing about 3% growth. Do we think that, as we move forward, we should be able to see some of the initiatives kick in and maybe that growth rate begin to slow down a little bit?","Harris Simmons","Listen, I think you're going to see it pretty flat and perhaps down a little bit. I mean you do have underlying these initiatives, I mean we were clear I think at the outset that those targets are growth targets, not net. And so you have normal kind of merit increases in compensation. We have a little higher incentive compensation accrual here in the first quarter than I think we had a year ago. And all of that's subject to kind of continued performance through the year. So that could be still variable and will be.","And I would also note that, I mean, there are some job categories where the -- where wage pressures particularly in IT kind of related areas, I mean there are a few kind of specialized areas where the pressures are very real. So our hope would be to keep those flat to down, I think consistent with -- at the end of the day, we're really keeping an eye on the $1.6 billion and the efficiency ratio number, and that's what I'm most comfortable affirming that I think we're on a pretty strong track to accomplish those goals.","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. If I could reinforce Harris's comments. We are very focused on the $1.6 billion maximum on non-interest expense. We're very focused on positive operating leverage. We're very focused on achieving our efficiency ratio objectives. So that's -- our focus is on the aggregate. And as Harris said, we've got levers in several of those line items and our expectation is that we'll achieve our target.","Marty Mosby - Vining-Sparks","The second question I was going to ask is another subject, I'm not asking about the level of capital deployment, but just the approach, back when we were at Investor Day, the stock price, you know, of the industry was very depressed, so you had a big discount to your tangible book value. That pretty much had been eliminated. So as you sit there, if you look at dividends and share repurchase, does the change in stock price level change your objectives in the sense of what you would ask for distributed between dividends and share repurchase?","Unidentified Company Representative","Go ahead, Harris.","Harris Simmons","Well, I'm not sure that it would today. But I mean, it's something, you know, we'll think about certainly hard before we -- before we pull any trigger.","You know, it's really an exercise in thinking about the path we're on, relative valuation between our company and others in the marketplace, and trying to be careful that the -- and, you know, more to come I guess once we get CCAR results. But I think the major theme would be that we're really certainly very cognizant of the need to ramp up distributions, and then how we do it is going to be a function of what the market looks like, what we look like, etcetera at the time, so.","James Abbott","Thanks. Abigail, it's -- we got about five minutes to go and we have a few questions left in the queue, so we're going to go to the lightning round so we're just going to go one question and then we'll try to be concise in our answers and see if we can get through all of them before we close.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","I was just curious a little more about what has changed on the loan side, you are finally starting to see some good momentum and more consistency, especially like in a quarter that's seasonally soft. Is it the runoff slowing? Are your markets strengthening? Or is it just momentum building on itself? You know, what would you point to?","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. I can start and ask my partners here to chime in.","There are a couple of items. One is, if you go back six months ago, there was a lot of internal operational things that were kind of going on, and I've become convinced after speaking with those on the line that there was a little bit of a distraction. And now that we've got everybody fully engaged and actively out marketing, we're starting to see the benefit of that.","I will say, anecdotally, although I haven't necessarily seen the evidence, but anecdotally, we believe that pay-downs, particularly in commercial real estate, are beginning to slow down or have slowed down in this quarter. And so that clearly would be also helpful.","James Abbott","We did -- Joe, this is James -- we did see origination volume in the quarter that was about 20% higher than it was in the year-ago quarter. And that I think supports Paul's comment that there were some distraction and it's really started to improve on that front. But also payoffs were slower.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets","Yup. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust","Thank you. Good evening. Could you talk to us about the loan severities you've seen and the energy charge-offs you've experienced over the last three to six months?","Scott McLean","Sure, Jennifer. Yeah, this is Scott. Right. And you just mean sort of anecdotally?","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust","Yes, correct.","Scott McLean","Yes, yes. So, generally speaking, on the reserve-based side, it's really kind of more of a marking to market, if you will. And on the oilfield service side, the losses there generally have related to private equity firm that may choose not to play forward and kind of forces a situation in the bankruptcy and liquidation. And I think that'll continue to be the trend. I think the losses on the oilfield service side will be lumpier and they will be because they just can't continue, and so that just accelerates the whole realization process, whereas on the reserve-based side, it's going to be kind of dribs and drabs here and there, and I don't think we'll have any real significant large pieces because we have no second lanes and we have no high-yield debt, and generally we had very conservatively underwritten senior pieces.","Unidentified Company Representative","Thank you.","Jennifer Demba - SunTrust","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is open.","Jack Micenko - SIG","Hey, good afternoon. How much was the reward card expense re-class and how should we think about the other expense line item on a run rate. It dropped it at around 56 this quarter. How do we -- is that a good run rate now with that expense out, or how should we think about that?","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. I'll start with your last question first. There's a lot of things that go into that, some of them being highly variable. I can't think of any items in particular that would change that number kind of quarter to quarter. So that's a decent approximation I think for run rate.","As it relates to the bank card reclassification of the expenses, that is an annual number of about $20 million.","Jack Micenko - SIG","Twenty-eight?","Paul Burdiss","Two-zero, 20.","Jack Micenko - SIG","Two-zero. All right, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Your C&I loan yields went down by 10 basis points this quarter after increasing 15 basis points in the fourth quarter. You mentioned some older loans are putting pressure on that portfolio and some of them are based off of prime versus LIBOR. Could you help us understand like how many loans actually rolled off or matured in the first quarter to cause that big swing in asset yields despite the Fed increase?","Harris Simmons","Yeah, I think, and we tried to be as transparent about this as possible, the key -- one of the key drivers there of that increase in loan yields in the fourth quarter, which we disclosed then and we disclosed this quarter, were these interest recoveries on loan recoveries, and this elevated loss share [ph] income associated with the FDIC. That was about $13 million in the quarter, wherein, if you're going to do the math, as I think it was John correctly did, that's worth about 13 basis points on the loan yield in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next --","Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray","Go ahead, sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Moran with Macquarie Capital. Your line is open.","John Moran - Macquarie Capital","Hey, thanks. I just wanted to revisit the defensive draws [ph]. I think you said there were five or six of them this quarter. Was that more out of the services or the upstream book? And then, what can you guys do to mitigate that or, kind of once it's there, how do you carry it?","Scott McLean","Well, first of all, the -- in terms of kind of the second part of your question, in terms of mitigating it, most banks are putting in anti-hoarding provisions and you don't have to wait for the maturity of a transaction to do that. It's generally almost everything in the energy space right now is being amended, renegotiated, etcetera, every six months or so. And so we're having pretty good luck at getting these anti-hoarding provisions in, number one.","Secondly, generally speaking, when it's one of our strong private equity firms that's involved, the odds are much less likely that they'll try a defensive draw [ph]. So -- and that's been what we've experienced. And to answer the first part of your question, I mentioned there was about 50 million in defensive draws [ph], one of which is payback or will pay back shortly partially. And it's about 50%, by company it's about 50% upstream, 50% services.","James Abbott","Yeah. By dollar amount it's about $30 million in upstream and $20 million in services.","Unidentified Company Representative","Services.","John Moran - Macquarie Capital","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is open.","Terry McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Just a quick question for Paul. When do you get to that $45 million run rate on the preferred stock dividends and can you just help us with the quarterly variability that we typically see?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I have a schedule here, if you could just hold on just a second. And just as a reminder, that $45 million, that's a 2017 figure. And I don't have that broken out all the way. I'll have to get back to you on the quarterly composition on that one. We'll have James follow up.","James Abbott","I was going to say, I'm happy to follow up. It's roughly $10 million on alternating quarters and $12 million on the other quarters. But I'll get back to you, Terry.","Terry McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Harris Simmons","Well, we just want to thank you all for your interest and participation in the call and we look forward to talking to many of you then.

Abbott","Good evening, and thanks, Jaimie. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our third quarter 2013 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the time over to Harris.","Harris H. Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you to the call today. Say, start by saying that in general, we are encouraged with the third quarter results. We're quite happy with the strength of our credit quality and the progress that we've made on reducing the cost of capital.","Looking back over the last year, I think it's especially noteworthy that we can report that the dollar amount of tangible common equity has increased nearly 15%, or nearly $550 million. That's a -- that's been a lot of progress. Talk about capital for just a moment, our common equity capital ratios, as I said, increased materially. They were boosted this quarter by preferred stock redemption, which effectively transferred $126 million from preferred equity to common equity. Doyle's going to elaborate more on this transaction later. Although it's something that we've been very transparent about in investor conferences and in our past SEC filings. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio, under Basel I increased to 10.4% from 10.0%. Although we still have some questions about how the Federal Reserve would be handling some risk weightings that will affect the Basel III ratio, we currently expect it to be above 10.0% as of September 30, 2013, totally phased in, assuming that we opt out, or in other words, exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from impacting the regulatory capital ratios. We expect the loan grow-- net loan growth didn't turn out to be as strong as we had anticipated. But we see a silver lining in the sequential quarter improvement in commitments, as well as an improvement in production. Growth was softer in the third quarter than it's been for 18 months, while residential mortgage and construction loans created some lift for us, it didn't get much lift from our commercial and industrial loan balances in the quarter.","These C&I loans have grown at a 10% compounded average interest rate for more than 2 years, but primarily because of elevated repayment activity in the third quarter, we experienced virtually no loan growth in this category. However, unfunded C&I commitments increased at a healthy rate, which is an encouraging signal. This will probably be a well-worn statement by banks this earnings season, but because of the elevated uncertainty coming from Washington of late, and we think there's a possibility that we'll continue to see a softer rate of growth than normal in the fourth quarter. An extension of the debt ceiling debate into January, doesn't really do much to help small businesses, who are kind of our bread-and-butter audience, to gain the necessary confidence they need to draw on their lines of credit and buy new equipment or build inventory.","Loan pricing remains competitive. Pricing declined a few basis points from the prior quarter, which is due in part to a shift in mix, with a little more residential mortgage than last quarter, and a somewhat greater amount of production of larger loans. We have mentioned on prior calls and the conferences for loan pricing pressure generally increases as the size of the loans increases. For Zions, the smaller loans account for about 2\/3 of our total production and the like amount of our overall portfolio. Nevertheless, because we're still experiencing adjustable rate loans resetting at lower levels and real estate loans refinancing at elevated speeds, we don't expect -- rather we do expect further pressure on loan yields. We don't expect that pressure to let up quite yet.","Credit quality is very encouraging. Our gross charge-offs are significantly below many of our peers' net charge-off levels. This quarter, net charge-offs were only 9 basis points annualized of average loans. The release provided statistics on the continued improvement in classified loans and nonperforming assets. But I might add that nonperforming asset inflows declined about 15% compared to the second quarter, and that loss severity rates also improved. Both of those bode well for further improvement in credit quality ratios. This continued improvement resulted in a further release of the allowance for credit losses.","As we have stated regularly, Zions is significantly asset-sensitive. Not only do we expect earnings to increase when rates arise, we expect to be able to avoid the significant haircut to equity that many banks may experience and some have already started to experience. There's a heavy concentration to long duration assets with securities with negative convexity. Under an immediate rate shock scenario, where rates rise 2 percentage points in a parallel fashion, our current estimate of the market pie of equity, which is the present value of assets plus the present value of liabilities, rises nearly 6% under a deposit repricing scenario that has us repricing our deposits reasonably fast and it increases nearly 12% under what we'd call kind of a slow deposit repricing scenario, of the 17 peer banks we compare ourselves to, only 7 report such a figure. But of those that do, about 70% reported negative market value of equity in that kind of a scenario. So we're -- we continue to be cautious in the way we manage that.","So with that overview, I'll now ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris. Good afternoon or evening, everybody. As noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common of $209.7 million or $1.12 per diluted common share for the third quarter. That compares to the prior quarter of $0.30 per share. There are 3 significant items that impacted the results and 2 of those items occurred in the third quarter and one occurred in the second quarter, but wasn't repeated. So let me highlight each of those for you. As mentioned, we called the Series C preferred stock in the quarter on September 15, which triggered after-tax income to common equity of $126 million, as Harris mentioned. Essentially, the par amount of the Series C preferred was $800 million at the time of the call, but the book amount was $926 million, with the difference being the value of the so-called beneficial conversion feature that arose out of, if you go all the way back to 2009, to the modification of the, some of the subordinated debt that we had at that time. The call then triggered the movement of the $126 million from preferred stock to retained earnings, and that occurred via an income statement line that you've not seen before, and probably will not see again from us. It's called preferred stock redemption, just below the preferred stock dividends on Page 10 of the -- which is the income statement in the earnings release. If you've got additional questions about how it was created, or why calling the Series C triggered this in the third quarter, we'll be happy to discuss that further later. But I think most of you were expecting a change in capital. Some of you might not be -- have been expecting, in fact, well, based on consensus estimates, probably few, if any of you were expecting it to go through the income statement in the way it did. But it's clearly isolated there for you.","The other third quarter earning that -- or third quarter item that impacted earnings this year arose from our ongoing review of our allowance for credit losses. In this case, specifically the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, which based on our experience, we refused. Line utilization rates as we have discussed from time to time on these calls or with you in person, have remained below historic averages for quite some time now. And essentially, we adjusted our credit conversion factors to use a lower expected line utilization rate in setting the reserve for unfunded commitments. This change in assumptions and models accounted for $18.4 million of the $19.9 million reduction in the RULC, and the rest was just the normal change in unfunded commitments outstanding and loan grading, et cetera.","And finally, the third item is that in -- remember in the last quarter, we had a $40 million pretax charge that was related to the successful tender offer for $258 million of our pretty expensive senior notes, as well as the redemption of the 8% Series B trust preferred issue. The expense was a result of the tender premiums and discount accretion on those instruments in the second quarter and wasn't -- and didn't repeat, obviously, in the third quarter.","So let's go through some of the revenue drivers now. We'll begin with a review of some of the key drivers on Page 15. Average loans held for investment increased $300 million compared to the prior quarter. In the period, loan balances increased $142 million, excluding FDIC-supported loans and loans held for sale.","The total loan production actually increased 4% sequentially as, because, as Harris mentioned, there were a higher level of repayments this quarter. We did not achieve the net loan growth that we had experienced in the prior quarter. We, along with several other banks, sent a cautionary signal at the Barclays conferences in September in this regard, and net growth was there, but it was slower this quarter. As an example, the C&I repayment rate was 13% higher than in the prior quarter, or about $350 million more of C&I loan runoff, not counting their originations. Anyway, $350 million, more runoff than in the trailing 4-quarter average.","Turning to Page 11, we have a couple of highlights from the loan table. Commercial industrial loans were relatively flat in the third quarter compared to the second. However, unlike recent quarters, we actually experienced attrition in C&I loans in Utah and Texas, while California, Arizona and Nevada experienced relatively healthy growth. So almost role reversals there between our -- the banks for a number of quarters have been the strongest and some of the others that have been more flattish.","Line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans declined further relative to the prior quarter, and we're at 32.2% compared to 33.2% at the end of the quarter. And again, for reference, we were kind of precrisis running in the 38% to 40% was a more normal utilization rate.","Construction development loans increased $49 million or about 2% sequentially, a slower rate than in the prior quarter. It was due entirely to higher repayment speeds in the third quarter. As we've discussed previously, new construction commitments have been fairly strong for the last several quarters during a period when pricing terms and covenants were very good. These loans are now in the funding stage after the equity has gone into the project. Total new unfunded commitments increased only 1% sequentially as we're hitting self-imposed concentration limits in some construction loan types in some markets. And in those markets, we are effectively constraining further growth.","As is evident from the runoff rates, some of our construction projects have completed, and are finding long term permanent fixed rate financing away from us, which is a segue into term CRE, which declined for the fifth quarter out of the past 6, in part due to the refinancing I just mentioned, and in part due to our national real estate book of business running down, which we've discussed in detail on previous calls. Excluding that national real estate, term CRE loans would've grown at a moderate rate.","Our production volume increased in term CRE, but it was concentrated in a small number of large syndicated deals. On those deals, the pricing was a bit thinner, but given the very low credit risk, we elected to participate, and those transactions resulted in a lower weighted average pricing on term CRE this quarter by about 33 bps. However, excluding the largest deals, the pricing on term CRE was actually quite stable across the other various sized buckets that we track and has been for the last 3 quarters.","Consumer lending improved materially, with balances rising by $163 million, which is primarily attributable to residential mortgage in the credit card businesses. On residential mortgage production, the weighted average coupon was 3.6%. It had a weighted average time to reset of 5.5 years on the production this quarter.","FDIC-supported loans continued their steady decline, which has been in a fairly tight range of $45 million to $60 million per quarter as we continue to work out of that portfolio. As it pertains to interest income and indemnification expense related to this loan book, we currently believe that the current expected cash flows will be nearly $80 million over the next 5 years, although most of that will be realized by the end of 2015, which compares to $21 million recognized in the third quarter.","The indemnification asset amortization expense, which is a subcomponent of other noninterest income, should amount to about $42 million and be exhausted by the end of 2014. So my general comment is that this portfolio continues to outperform the assumptions that we used when we priced it, but the accounting was, is and will remain complicated. And James will be happy to walk you through all of that if -- those of you who want to torture yourself with it. But it's important to realize that, that asset is still large enough and the accounting is such that it -- these entries each quarter materially impact both interest income, as well as noninterest expense, and they tend to offset each other partially when you get to net income at the bottom.","Okay, margin and net interest income, Page 15 of the release, you'll note that the NIM declined considerably compared with the prior quarter, about 22 basis points of decline. However, recall that in the prior quarter, we had indicated NIM benefited from a significant increase in income -- in interest income from FDIC-covered loans, and that we did expect this benefit to drop considerably in the third quarter, which it did, back to something more like the run rate of the prior couple of quarters, by the second quarter and a couple before that. Total interest income from FDIC-supported loans fell to $21 million from $35 million, which accounted for 11 basis points, or half of the NIM compression. The further buildup of cash, which is now 18% of earning assets, further impacted the NIM by about 3 basis points. The rest was due to the ongoing pressure from the loan book resetting as old loans run off and -- or roll off, and are replaced at lower rates and spreads.","Although we ceased providing a core net interest income number, we did commit to giving you the components, so that you could continue to calculate it. The additional accretion is found on the table at the bottom of Page 11, equaling $15 million and a discount amortization on sub debt was $12.8 million. That's a number I don't believe you can find as a single line item, but it's buried in interest expense. Adjusting for these factors, there was about a $1 million linked quarter decrease of net interest income, or not very much.","Turning to noninterest income, after adjusting for the noise and the securities gains\/losses, this was a pretty straightforward quarter, with 2 notable items. The first being the decline in loan sales servicing, which was attributable to a drop in mortgage refinancing volume. I doubt that, that surprises any of you. Our refi volume declined 36% sequentially. But our purchase volume increased 8%. Second item was a $4 million gain on the sale of several branches from our California franchise, which is included in other noninterest income.","Turning to the noninterest expense, the salary and benefit line increased modestly. There are a number of moving parts, such as lower incentive comp, offset by base salary increases. But in general, it's trending in line with previous guidance in a modest expected growth rate. Also in July, we set expectations that professional and legal services expense will be elevated through at least the end of the year. And these are largely consulting expenses related to improving our stress test capabilities as we graduate into the CCAR class, and there's a lot of work to do that is being done there. On credit, I'm going to skip credit quality, other than to echo Harris' comment that things look very good and seem likely to continue to improve on most fronts, including NPAs and classified assets.","With regard to capital, we completed the call of the Series C in September as we discussed. This should end a, what has been a very significant noise source in the earnings reports for the past 4 years. Going back to June of 2009 when we modified the sub debt to include an option to convert into preferred stock. And more than $750 million of conversions actually took place in rather unpredictable and volatile amounts each quarter there for several years. And we finally, the last entry probably is the -- moving the beneficial conversion feature from preferred back into common, $126 million that we just did. Although the -- I know this has been noisy, and at times frustrating to many of you trying to model the company. The cost of this capital was considerably lower than if we had just issued common stock back in June of 2009 when the stock was trading at less than 50% of tangible book value, I will note that our regulatory capital ratios, common equity Tier 1 on a Basel I basis increased 40 basis points to 2.43%, and -- what did I say? Two? Sorry, I'll send the defibrillators out to anyone who got panicked by that, 10.43%. Other regulatory capital ratios came down a bit because of the call of the Tier 1 -- other Tier 1 preferred stock during the quarter.","The -- turning to -- wrapping up with a little bit of outlook, and then we'll take your questions, with regard to loan growth, this one's tough. It's frankly hard to predict. Our lenders report to us that we have not noted a major step down in customer optimism, given all the goings-on in Washington, although it's probably too early to tell. And as I think Harris mentioned, we've got another go around potentially in just a few months in January. A number of you used to ask whether we were kicking the can down the road in converting some of our C&I, our -- excuse me, our construction real estate loans into term and we assured you not. We can't hold a candle to the can kicking. It seems to be going on in Washington these days.","In addition, because of the strong appetites by nonbank entities, such as life insurance companies and pension funds, which we don't expect to abate, we're probably going to modestly lower our outlook on loan growth to slight to moderate, instead of just moderate over the 1 year time horizon. But I will tell you that loan growth through the first 3 weeks of the quarter has been pretty good, and the fourth quarter generally is a pretty strong one for us, particularly in the last few weeks of the year, which then reverts in early January.","The bottom line is, pipelines remain fairly strong, line utilization remains fairly weak. And it's just really hard to figure out. There's no compelling change in the direction either -- certainly not getting dramatically weaker. But there's no evidence that the sentiment in loan demand is growing stronger out there that we can see, either.","So net interest income, excluding any effect from this -- the expected decline in interest income from the FDIC-supported loans, we expect net interest income to decline modestly, primarily due to loans resetting at lower rates, as well as new production yields that are averaging near 3.8% on a weighted average basis compared with the current book yield of 4.4%. I might note, there's not that much price softening going on. There's price pressure, but a lot of that yield is mix, where we've got more residential mortgage production than has just now, historically been the case.","Noninterest income, we expect the less volatile components of noninterest income, such as service fees, to continue on a modest upward trend. Noninterest expense should be somewhere near $400 million in the fourth quarter. This factors in a more normal provision for the unfunded lending commitments, a more normal legal accrual and some increase in expenses from our core processing systems conversion project. We expect that provision expense will remain negative, given modest loan growth and a continued improvement in problem loans. And in light of what by almost any metric is an ALLL that is among the strongest in the industry. So the outlook is for continued modest reserve releases over the next few quarters.","Although we continually evaluate the reasonableness of various factors that drive the model, we don't expect a recurrence of anything like the magnitude of change in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments that we did this quarter, particularly until we see a more consistent drawing down of unfunded commitment lines.","Preferred stock dividends in the fourth quarter should drop to about $17 million or $18 million, and should total about $66 million in the year 2014 with just due to the timing of dividend payments, will vary a few million, up or down on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But the total for the year should be about $66 million.","Jaimie, with that, we will take questions, and will you please open up the lines?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just want to see -- if you can give us a little more color on the outlook for the loan yield more specifically, I mean, it looks like x the FDIC items, the core loan yield was down about 12 bps, I guess, linked quarter? Correct me if I'm wrong. And should we expect a similar decline of that magnitude based on your comments there, Doyle?","James R. Abbott","Hi, John, this is James. I -- the -- I'll tell you, most of the compression in the loan yield this quarter compared to last quarter, was due to really 2 factors. One is the residential, higher concentration of residential mortgage, which is coming in at 3.60%. And that's substantially below where we were at, the 4% the last couple of quarters in overall production. But then the other one is the large loan volume. We did 2 or 3 loans this quarter, there were some syndicated credits, and those had very solid backing and as a result, they had a little thinner spread than what we normally would participate in. But -- so it's hard to say that it's going to continue to drop at 12 basis points per quarter but...","Doyle L. Arnold","I would say it's -- that I hope and I think that, that 12 is probably a little more than we should expect on a quarter-to-quarter basis if we -- again, if we abstract away from a few large syndicated credits, and we -- if we see more a rebound in our bread-and-butter -- excuse me, C&I middle-market type of lending, the pricing on that is not as pressured in some other markets. And I think the -- probably that level of pressure is overstating the case.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up will be on the securities side. So the amount of increase and securities balances this quarter, just wanted to get a little more color there and then, how we should think about the securities yields. So I know they moved quite a bit in the quarter as well.","Harris H. Simmons","David Hemingway, our Chief Investment Officer is here, and he's clicking at the available for sale... David, that increased be about 149, or so?","W. David Hemingway","Yes, we did just buy some floating-rate agencies obviously, that had lower yield than the other available-for-sale securities that are in there. Obviously, we have a higher yield than the money market, yes that's at just -- had sat at 25 basis points. So I would think as we see some opportunities to increase the overall income, without taking a negative convexity risk or without taking credit risk, we'll probably continue to buy a few things. But I wouldn't expect anything dramatic.","Doyle L. Arnold","I would note that even with buying a bit of securities, our total cash and due from and money market actually continued to increase in the quarter, in part driven by -- if you look at the balance sheet, about a -- over a $700 million increase in noninterest-bearing demand accounts, which the money -- another sign of perhaps indecision, at least on the part of commercial customers, because that remains the primary place where those DDA balances are growing.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And on the deposit side, you just mentioned that you're having a tough time putting the money to work on the loans, and most banks are, and you don't really want to extend your securities portfolio, why not try to drive some of those deposits out, that's probably being a drag on your NIM?","Harris H. Simmons","Well, we don't want to drive deposits out by driving customers out. And it's basically existing customers leading more cash with us, and we're going to assume we're providing -- let's just say about as little an incentive for them to do that as we can conjure up. So it remains a struggle to -- because, I mean the fundamental cycle here is that the Fed is pumping -- continuing to pump liquidity into the economy, and it piles up when people and companies that are cautious and undecided and uncertain about what to do with it. So here it sits. And we, in turn, park it, give it back to the Fed, I guess, so they can buy more bonds. And wash, rinse, repeat. But I don't have a good answer for you. It's something we just continue to struggle with, and we haven't found the magic key. I mean, it's having our customers, having that degree of confidence in us that they'd rather keep their cash here than in a money market mutual fund or -- at another bank, we like that part of it. But it's not a good problem.","Doyle L. Arnold","I mean, we've got about, I think about $2.6 billion that we've -- have helped customers move into money market suites. And so we're looking for opportunities where that makes sense for them and for us.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And a follow-up question, is there any regions doing better than other regions? I know you have a pretty good diversified customer base, but I'm just wondering, is California doing better than Texas? Or where do you see -- and do you see any growth out there in some of the geographic areas?","Harris H. Simmons","Real estate demand, commercial real estate demand remains reasonably strong in a lot of areas. I think the big change this quarter was the softening in C&I demand in Texas in particular, which had been a driver of growth. Whether that is something that's likely to persist or not, we've not had the time really to delve into that. But -- and as we mentioned in the remarks, so in general loan growth was a little stronger in Arizona and Nevada and California than it had been. James, do you want to -- do you have any other color you want to add there?","Doyle L. Arnold","It looks -- actually, things look reasonably pretty -- with like I said, the exception of the -- Amegy this quarter had a $32 million decline in commercial and industrial loans. And historically, Amegy has seen $150 million to $300 million worth of growth in C&I in a quarter. So that was probably the one spot that was softer than it historically has been. Otherwise, certainly very encouraging to see Nevada and Arizona and Colorado strengthening, clearly strengthening.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I think you mentioned that growth was a little bit stronger and I think that commercial growth was a little bit stronger in the first couple of weeks of October. Is that due to a slowdown in prepayments or is it actually due to more of a rebound in the underlying demand for loans?","Doyle L. Arnold","I -- do you have an actual answer?","Harris H. Simmons","Well, I was just going to-- unless repayments, altogether, stopped at Amegy in a 1-week period of time, I would say that there's some additional line of credit growth people have drawn on their lines at Amegy. We've seen over $100 million worth of C&I growth just at Amegy in the first -- so far this month. So I don't think there's massive change in prepayment speeds. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","No, I was going to say the same thing. It's probably just -- I mean, that -- we've seen, in total, I think it's something like $150 million of growth in 2, 3 weeks. $100 million of it is there at Amegy in C&I and it's got to reflect just draws on existing lines of credit, nothing else changes that much that fast really. And the question is, is that -- we haven't seen this -- we've mentioned, because we've talked to some of you about it, this is -- we've seen a strong first month of the quarter in the third quarter and in the second quarter, followed by real softness in the second month of the quarter, followed by some strengthening again in the third. Whether that is going to prove to be a persistent pattern or what this represents, there's no way for us to know at this point.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, that helps. And then just a follow-up question on the resi growth in the quarter, obviously this isn't where, I guess -- I'm going to say it's not your area of expertise if I could say that. But how much growth would you be willing to put on in resi if we don't see any meaningful improvement in commercial over the next several quarters?","Doyle L. Arnold","Harris, do you want to comment on our residential mortgage initiatives and what we've been doing there or would you like me to?","Harris H. Simmons","No, I'd be happy to. I mean, we're doing a lot of kind of reengineering in the back office, on the residential mortgage operation. Our expectation is that eventually that's going to allow us to support higher levels of production. We think there's more we can do, given sort of our natural market share, if you will, in a lot of these markets. And while we've been pretty underweight in residential mortgage, I'd tell you that anything we put on the books is going to have reasonably modest duration to it. I think you all know kind of how we think about negative convexity risk that I've been talking about so much. But it's going to take -- I think it's going to take -- it's not going to show up immediately. And I think we've got a reasonably decent business there. It's one we think we can turn it into a really great business. But it's -- but that doesn't happen overnight. I do think that you're going to see a better environment for us in this business. There are a lot of private -- a lot of lenders that are just going to find it too complicated to be in the residential mortgage business. I think that you're going to have some very small community banks making under 500 loans and they'll have some exemptions under the QM rules. But there's a whole other tier of banks, over $ 2 billion and over 500 loans, who I think are going to have a tough time having the scale to be fairly effective in that line of business.","Doyle L. Arnold","I would -- I'd comment more broadly. I mean, even with this growth, I haven't actually calculated, but I'm pretty sure that our total consumer portfolio is probably still less than 20% or in the neighborhood of 20% of total loans. Strategically, that is -- we would like to grow consumer to a somewhat larger percentage of the total, and the 2 natural areas for us to do that are to focus on some 2 product lines that really had not been a focus previously. One is resi mortgages, both first and equity lines, the other is credit card, where we're starting off a much smaller base but plan to grow in both cases within our footprint, kind of serving our community regional bank customer base. And that's what you can expect as the offset to what clearly will be less concentration than, if you go back to the mid-2005, 2006 era in commercial real estate, particularly in land lending and early-stage development lending. So less CRE, more consumer and lots of C&I is what we'd like the portfolio to look like.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I would just circle back, more to clarify than anything else, on the slowdown in C&I this quarter, which sounds like principally Amegy but somewhat Utah too. So do you just not have much of an explanation for that yet or is there -- do you have a sense more what's kind of behind that trend, which is reversal from what sounds like several quarters now?","Doyle L. Arnold","We've got Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer here. He can talk a little bit about Utah, at least. Go ahead, Michael.","Michael Morris","Well I think you've picked up on Amegy. I think some of the attrition has come through the National Real Estate Group which does a lot of owner-occupied financing, which gets classified as commercial. So some of that rundown is intentional and...","Doyle L. Arnold","That's probably Utah and the National Real Estate, not at Amegy.","Michael Morris","So at Amegy, I don't -- I think the economy there remains very strong. I don't -- the frac-ing boom continues, et cetera. I don't have -- wish I could text Scott McLean if he happens to be listening in, but I can't because I don't have a sense that anything fundamental has changed in Texas and why we had this pause this quarter, I'm not quite sure.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like it's already off to a good start this quarter, so that makes sense. And then just, I guess, a separate follow-up is can you quantify what term CRE pay downs were this quarter and how did that compare to the amount you saw last quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","James is flipping through his chart book. I'm going to stall for time here while he finds it -- okay.","James R. Abbott","The repayment rate this quarter was about 32%, Joe, compared to about 27% last quarter. So the -- I'm not sure if that's what you were looking for, but the national real estate if you're tracking that, that was down about $75 million compared to the prior quarter. So if you normalize for that, we saw about a 20 -- a little over $20 million increase in terms of commercial real estate if you exclude the effect of National Real Estate.","Harris H. Simmons","I would make just one quick observation there, Joe, and that is if you look at the 5-year treasury, that we've -- today it's about 135 [ph]. Five years ago today, it was about 282 [ph]. But by the end of 2008, it was down to 155 [ph]. So, I mean, if things really changed pretty precipitously toward the end of 2008, beyond that may have made a very, very little sense. So I do think that will probably get -- going to get to a point where that's the kind of the risk-free rate and you've got the credit spreads on top of that. They've certainly [indiscernible] to it too. But I do think that the impetus for refinancing and the reset rates at which things are refinancing, because a lot of our resets on some of this longer-term paper -- longer-duration paper tends to be about 5 years, I think, within a couple of quarters, we're going to get to a point where a lot of that has bled through. But I -- I mean, that's just my opinion.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the last call you guys talked about the haircut you need to take on your Tier 1 capital calculation under Basel III because of the CDO book. Can you just update us on whether you've gotten any closer to finalizing what that's going to be, ultimately? And then if you haven't had that Tier 1 capital ratio adjusted for this quarter for Basel III?","Doyle L. Arnold","There's still a little bit of uncertainty in the CET1 under Basel III but fully phased-in. I believe, as Harris mentioned, we now estimate that it would be north of 10%. The -- so it's pretty -- that's a pretty strong Basel III. It's going to be somewhere, we think, in the 10% to 10.5% range.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the Tier 1 capital ratio?","Doyle L. Arnold","Now that one -- I was going to say the Tier 1 capital and the total capital -- risk-based capital, where the impacts of the corresponding deduction approach will impact us, and I don't have those numbers in front of us, but James actually has pulled them out. So we'll give you some -- probably some of the estimates.","James R. Abbott","Yes, they would be almost identical, Dave. The -- I'm a little hesitant to give the number that I'm sitting on right now because of -- we're still finalizing it, but the difference between the Tier 1 common and the Tier 1 total is only about 5 basis points different.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So really no change from the last quarter then.","Doyle L. Arnold","No.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In terms of the difference.","Doyle L. Arnold","Correct. But what's happening, the interesting thing is that all of this doesn't start really for another 5 or 6 quarters. In every quarter, we are getting pay downs now on the CDO portfolio. So every quarter, the amount of that other Tier 1 and Tier 2 haircut is being reduced. So essentially, the big picture here is very strong CET1 ratio and then the other ratios, present trends, continue should grow as the CDO portfolio, particularly the senior tranches, continue to pay down.","Harris H. Simmons","Yes. And, David, we actually included a new table in the press release this quarter just because of the paydowns or potential sales of these securities over the course of the next year or 2, might become an interesting part of the story to follow. And so we've included a table on Page 5 of the press release, showing the change in the CDO portfolio relative to the year-ago period. It doesn't change fast enough to show, compared to the prior quarter, but compared to the year-ago period. So the par value is down about $175 million, which is -- that's helpful, obviously, to the corresponding deduction -- calculation. So we've seen the AOCI improvement, on a pretax basis, up about $260 million. So given that...","Doyle L. Arnold","But the reason that asset is important is the reduction of amortized cost of $259 million.","Harris H. Simmons","Yes.","Doyle L. Arnold","Okay?","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, got you. So I guess it's just the way you think you're going to have to calculate those ratios today, 1 to 2 years from now, are you comfortable with that calculation in those levels?","Harris H. Simmons","Comfortable, well...","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In terms of the overall level for Tier 1 capital ratio and whatnot?","Harris H. Simmons","CET1, yes. Tier 1, I mean, frankly, if it were fully phased in today it would look, despite having on a Basel I basis, over a 2.3% of RWA is preferred stocks, for example, on a Basel III basis fully phased in, we would be quite light, relative to peers, instead of being heavy in that, relative to peers. So I'm not -- frankly, we're not anxious to issue more preferred or sub debt to -- particularly preferred, than we have today. So I think we're going to ride with it and see if that CDO portfolio doesn't continue to improve. And frankly, we've got get over 1 year before that phase-ins starts, and then 3 more years after that. And our projections show that under a reasonable, very modest continued recovery, we will see a lot of movement in the amortized cost and the fair value of that portfolio over that time period.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Murray from ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit, you and many other banks are seeing pretty healthy growth in commitments and yet utilization rates are near historical lows for most. What is sort of the disconnect there? And when these companies are adding to commitments and taking out new commitments, what's sort of the dialogue? What are they indicating why they're not using it? Just curious there.","Harris H. Simmons","I think the reason why they're not using it is uncertainty. Because I think there -- that's not always the case, but in the C&I world, it actually costs you money to take out a new commitment and then sit on it. So there has to be a degree of caution, uncertainty and conservatism on their part if they may be viewing it, in some cases, to some degree, as an insurance policy.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes. I mean, the only thing I would add is locking into some certainty with respect to rate.","Harris H. Simmons","Yes.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then...","Harris H. Simmons","Wish I had -- gee, I hadn't thought of that answer for you, but I don't.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And just -- you had a little bit of OTTI again on the [indiscernible] CDO portfolio. When you think about the rating agency view of that portfolio and where you'd like to be down the line on debt costs, do you think you're getting closer to an understanding there, or is it still a ways off?","Harris H. Simmons","The -- oh, I got a -- I went down the wrong path there trying to follow your question. So let me comment in a couple of respects. Yes, we did have additional OTTI this quarter. Not all that much in the grand scheme of things. Primarily resulted from a changed model for evaluating OTTI and fair value in which we -- the main driver of the increase was a new variable in the model, in which is how long -- time and deferral. How long has a deferring bank been deferring? And the reciprocal of that is how much time does it yet have to cure? The theory being that the longer it's been deferring, all other things being equal, there must be something the regulators or somebody is concerned about that we can't observe and, therefore, the probability that it might not cure goes up. So between -- I'll just say, between kind of that change and the fact that a number of banks are curing themselves and dropping out of our deferring bank pool, we have ratcheted up the weighted average default probability and the remaining pool from about 44% fourth quarter a year ago to 66% this quarter. In other words, the good have gotten better and dropped out of the pool, and we've gotten a little more conservative on some of those remaining in the pool. That -- but that latter, the getting more conservative, drove this and that was kind of a onetime change in our model. The rating agencies are kind of split on the securities themselves. Moody's and Fitch have been regularly upgrading a number of these securities, sometimes by -- a matter of fact, most times by multiple notches. S&P has been the lagger here. They have -- they seem to have a pattern of not upgrading a security until shortly before it actually pays off, which strikes us as being a little strange. But...","Doyle L. Arnold","Very conservative.","Harris H. Simmons","Oh, yes. Very conservative. And with regard to -- if you were asking a question about -- with regard to our own ratings, Zions Bancorp's ratings, yes, I think it's still a concern, but as the portfolio reduces in size, it's still very, very large. But -- it's becoming less of a concern, but it's still a real concern. And how much varies by agency, do you want to comment any further, James?","James R. Abbott","I was just going to say we've got about 4 minutes remaining, so we're going to shift to the lightning round. [Operator Instructions]","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So historically, Doyle, you spoke of needing, I think it was $400 million or $500 million a quarter of loan growth off of the asset yield compression. Given the outlook for a fairly tepid growth and it seems that more of the growth is coming from lower-yielding loans. Can you help us think about the magnitude of margin pressure you would expect at least over the near term?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I actually ratcheted down my $400 million to $500 million to, maybe, $300 million to $400 million based on the -- knowing that some of the sources of margin pressure were going to be abating by third quarter of this year, namely, some of the -- the bulk of the repricing of the National Real Estate portfolio that was made in kind of first half of 2008, and 2 years prior to that would be behind us and a couple other things. However, it does appear that there's been some -- you're right, the new loans makes us a little less rich from a margin standpoint. And there seems to be some renewed, more -- the pricing pressure, just in general, has not abated as we thought we might. So yes, it might take still $400 million to $500 million to keep the margin stable, and it's not clear in this environment that we will get it, hence our slight softening of our net interest income guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neill.","Brad J. Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a question on credit quality. It sounds like you guys feel pretty positive about where things are. Just the pace of the reserve release, maybe less this quarter, given your positive comments around credit, relative to the first and second quarter, just any additional color there and what you think -- how quickly you draw that down as you move into 2014?","Doyle L. Arnold","No, I don't think we're going to change our fundamental posture. The -- setting aside the unfunded lending commitment change, the drawdown on the ALLL was actually the smallest this quarter than it's been in at least 1 year. No particular thing driving that. I would expect some -- probably, unless something changes, my guess is the reserve release would look more like the prior quarters, on the ALLL, than the current quarter, at least for the next 2 or 3 quarters. Something in the $15 million, $20 million-maybe range. Just a guess, the calculations will be what they will be toward the end of the quarter. But based on the trends, that's kind of what my gut tells me.","Harris H. Simmons","I would just comment, if you -- I think, if you added the RULC and the ALLL release this quarter, it about averages what the total ACL change has been for quite a few quarters now. So the unusually large RULC was coincidentally offset by a smaller ALLL. But I would guess the total would still be kind of in that higher range.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","As we get into you guys moving into CCAR from CaPR this year, and you have -- you got through the Series B and Series C. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the prioritization of either putting in for more of these sub and senior debt redemptions as you go through CCAR, versus your other potential uses of capital return as you think about CCAR now going in with a 10% plus Basel III ratio?","Doyle L. Arnold","Are you trying to get me to -- I don't think I want to go there because we haven't really had those discussions. I would note that the -- about the only expensive capital that we have haven't addressed yet was we've got -- we tendered for about as much senior debt as we could get. There's probably not much point in doing another tender. It matures in the third quarter of next year and just pay it off and replace it with cheaper debt would be the logical thing to think about. And with regard to the sub debt, that matures in '14 and '15, depending upon the issue. We'll look at tender premiums and whatnot as a part -- and that possibility as a part of our capital plan and see if it's worthwhile to accelerate any of that. But you've got $0.5 billion -- it's over $0.5 billion between the modified and unmodified sub debt that's still out there and pretty expensive. In terms of where I won't go is in terms of common equity, stock buybacks, dividend increases. I'm just going to defer on that totally until we go through the process.","Operator","The next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My one question is if the revenue environment continues to be soft for the industry into next year, is there room to lower that $400 million quarterly expense run rate that you mentioned we should model for you in 4Q?","Doyle L. Arnold","No. I mean, not materially. We've got so much -- we're lowering it where we can. And regulatory assessment costs and things will be lower next year than this year. But realistically, I think -- maybe not quite as much on consulting expense next year as this on CCAR, but I think, if any of our consultants are listening in they'll be delighted by this comment, I think we'll still have them around, to some degree, next year because we just frankly won't get everything done to the level we need to on CCAR this year. And the core upgrade and accounting systems upgrade projects will -- the increased spend on that will kind of offset for the next year or 2 at least, maybe several years in the case of the core project, the improvements that we expect on some of those other fronts: litigation expense, regulatory assessment expenses, et cetera.","Harris H.

I don't know if you dug into this and I missed it, but with the charge off ratio, I think you said 9 basis points and with the allowance, I think it's 2.3%. How are you guys -- have you guys changed your mind on sort of what a long-term normalized level would be for these measures, or are you still kind of thinking the same?","Doyle L.

I -- long term, to me, includes a probable change from an incurred loss to an expected loss model to occur sometime in 1 to 2 years out. And I would expect that for us and the industry to result in reserves higher than -- for the industry, higher than where they are now, for us, probably something more like where we are now, something in the low 2% range. If -- but until that happens, and we're under the current incurred loss model, I would expect, with this kind of credit quality, our total ACL, which I believe was 2.3% this quarter down from 2.4%, to continue to come down every quarter, probably until there's nothing else changed, it's probably on a glide path to get in the mid -- to 1.5% to 2% range, somewhere like that, kind of where a lot of others are.","Harris H.

Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just on the release of the provision for the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, is that figure calculated on a kind of a strict look back of average utilization levels, or is it really based on a little more of your expectations and feel for kind of where things are going to go over the next, say, 6-12 months?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, the ALLL component is based on outstandings. The reserve for unfunded lending commitments is based on the unfunded portion. Both are based on look-backs. As Harris kind of briefly mentioned, we're basically, in both cases, taking our actual experience from the beginning of 2008 right up through the most recent quarter, and every quarter we're adding 1\/4 to look at loss rates by loan type, by geography, by credit grade. And so as any of those things changes, it changes the quantitative portion of the ALLL. And then the additional factor for the unfunded lending commitment reserve is what the expected utilization rate is. That -- we don't change that every quarter, we kind of made a onetime change from something like 45% average, previous quarters, to something in the low 30%s this quarter based on the experience that we've had here. And kind of that's the way it's done, and then on top of that, we have a qualitative portion that's derived from another number of judgmental things. We frankly haven't changed much in the last few quarters, those judgmental qualitative factors. So the changes you're seeing are driven primarily by the quantified part of the reserve. Does that tell you what you needed, or more, or less?","Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes, that's very helpful. I appreciate it.","Harris H. Simmons","Well I think we're about done. James, do you want to wrap us up?","James R. Abbott","Thank you very much for joining the call today. We will be happy to take further questions from you. If you do have them, please call me or drop me an email. Thanks so much, and we'll talk to you again next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today.

I will now turn the time over to James Abbott.","James R. Abbott","Thank you, Jamie, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our second quarter 2013 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?","Harris H. Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and we welcome all of you to the call this afternoon or evening, depending on where you are. We're encouraged with the second quarter's results, which included positive performance in areas of loan growth, credit quality, capital levels and costs.","Talking first about loan growth, we enjoyed stronger loan growth in the past several quarters, along with solid improvement in loan production volumes. We experienced strong growth in commitments, including more than a $600 million increase in unfunded commitments during the quarter, which is often a sign of customer optimism, and indeed conversations with our relationship managers suggest that customer optimism has improved compared to late 2012. So we do think the environment is getting better that way.","Loan pricing remains competitive, although the yield on our overall production was pretty stable compared to the prior quarter, and this trend was confirmed by recent reports from our relationship managers suggesting that pricing today is not significantly worse than a quarter ago. As we've mentioned on prior calls and in conferences, the loan pricing pressure comes predominantly from the largest loans. The pricing on smaller loans, although down in the last 6 months, has been much more stable than the pricing of larger credits. In fact, small loan pricing is declining at a rate that's about 1\/3 of the rate of decline of large loans, and that's important for us because smaller loans account for about 2\/3 of our total production in a similar amount of our overall portfolio. Nevertheless, because we are still experiencing adjustable rate loans resetting lower and real estate loans refinancing at elevated speeds, we do expect further pressure on loan yields, perhaps to a lesser degree today than we did 3 months ago, given the rise we're seeing in 5-year and 10-year benchmark interest rate.","On the credit front, we continue to enjoy declining credit costs, with net charge-offs reaching their lowest point since the beginning of the crisis several years ago at 6 basis points of average loans. That includes the effect of significant recoveries this quarter. The earnings release provides statistics on the strong rates of improvements in classified loans and nonperforming assets, but I might add that nonperforming asset inflows declined, showing an improvement of about 10% compared to the first quarter and that loss severity rates also improved, both of which -- both of which bode well for further improvement in credit quality ratios for the next several quarters.","As we stated regularly, Zions is significantly asset-sensitive. Not only do we expect earnings to increase when rates rise, we expect to be able to avoid the significant haircut to equity that many banks might be expected to experience due to their heavier concentrations in loan types that have longer durations or securities with negative convexity. I would note that our tangible common equity per share increased in the second quarter by about 2% or $0.42 per share compared to the prior quarter. Our accumulated other comprehensive income improved by $32 million compared to the prior quarter. It has improved by more than $200 million during the past year.","Finally, with respect to capital, our Tier 1 common equity capital ratio remains above 10% under Basel I. Although we haven't yet finalized our calculation of the fully phased-in Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, we currently expect it to be approximately 9.2% as of June 30, 2013 on a fully phased-in basis, assuming we opt out of the AOCI inclusion in regulatory capital ratios.","So with that general overview, I'll turn the time over to Doyle Arnold, and ask him to review our quarterly financial performance in a little more detail. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris. Good evening, everybody. First, brief overview as noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $55.4 million or about $0.30 per diluted common share for the quarter. In the prior quarter, we reported EPS of $0.48 a share. The most significant item that adversely affected or impacted EPS this quarter, when compared to the prior quarter, is the $0.14 per share impact from the tender offer for $258 million of our expenses senior notes, as well as the redemption of our 8% Series B Trust-preferred issues. Although these debt extinguishment costs impacted earnings this quarter, in combination with the issuance of lower-cost debt and other securities during the quarter, we made significant progress toward our previously and oft-stated goal of reducing interest expense on our cost of preferred capital going forward.","On the revenue side of the equation, the income from the FDIC-insured loans was meaningfully higher than in the prior quarter and added about $0.03 per share to earnings. The negative provision for credit costs, including for both funded and unfunded loan commitments, benefited EPS by about $0.06 per share in the second quarter as compared to $0.12 per share benefit in the prior quarter. And additionally, security gains and losses, including OTTI, netted to a loss about $3 million or $0.01 a share similar to the prior quarter's level.","Turning now to a little bit of a commentary on revenue drivers, I'll begin by noting that average loans held for investment increased by $419 million compared to the prior quarter or roughly 1%. We paid more attention to average loans because of the variability of period-end balances and because it's the number that actually drives earnings. End-of-period loan balances actually increased by a bit more, $471 million.","Let me draw your attention to the loan table on Page 11 of the release. The pages are numbered in the upper-left corner of the tables. C&I loans grew by nearly $400 million in the second quarter. The growth was broad-based, both geographically and by industry. Interestingly, for the first time in quite a while, line utilization rates on revolving C&I loans experienced an increase over the prior quarter. They were about 33.2% compared to 31.8% at the end of the first quarter. Commercial commitments grew at an annualized rate of about 8% and accounted for more than the half of total linked quarter commitment growth.","Within C&I, smaller loan originations grew at a significantly stronger rate than the larger loans. In fact, for loans above $10 million in commitment size, we actually had a net decline in originations in each of the past 3 quarters, in part due to a very competitive and oftentimes unattractive pricing environment for those larger loans. You can -- I'll give you a couple of benchmarks here to give you a perspective on the pricing pressure. Gross yields on our large loan production, that is new loans in the quarter, declined nearly 12 months -- excuse me, 12% during the past 6 months, while yields on smaller loans have only declined by about 2%. Our production and our loan portfolio itself are, as you know, skewed towards smaller loan sizes. It's always to say, we're -- our address is 1 Main Street, not 1 Wall Street.","Construction development loans increased about $150 million or about 7% sequentially. As we've discussed previously, new construction commitments have been fairly strong for several quarters, during a period when pricing terms and covenants generally were pretty good. Those loans are now in their funding stage after the equity has gone into the project, so we expect this category to continue to grow through the remainder of 2013. We also did extend net new commitments in the second quarter, which was about 1\/3 of the linked quarter growth in total commitments. On the other hand, owner-occupied loans and term CRE loans each declined during the quarter for a combined $148 million of reduction. About 90% of this decline is attributable to the continued reduction in our national real estate portfolio, which is split between the 2 categories, that is roughly 60% owner-occupied and 40% term CRE. The national real estate portfolio declined at an annualized rate of 14% and we expect it to continue to decline, particularly as long as community banks have abundant liquidity and need the earning assets on their balance sheet, and therefore, stopped or reduced the quantity of loans that fit the criteria, which we will buy that they're offering for sale.","Excluding the effects of the NRE portfolio, the owner-occupied loan portfolio would have increased slightly, while the term CRE portfolio would still have declined modestly. On each of these types, pricing was stable to moderately better in the second quarter when compared with the first quarter, with the only exception being on the largest loan sizes. Consumer lending improved, with balances rising about $105 million, just partly attributable to seasonality on residential mortgage and credit card businesses.","FDIC-supported loans continued the very steady decline of about $50 million per quarter that you've witnessed for a number of quarters now. As it pertains to interest income and indemnification expense related to this loan book, we currently believe that the current expected cash flow supporting accretable income will be approximately $100 million over the next 5 years, although about 95% of that will be realized by the end of 2015. The indemnification asset amortization expense, I can't say that very fast, which is a subcomponent of other noninterest expense, should amount to about $51 million and will be exhausted by the end of 2014.","Turning now to the net interest margin on Page 15 of the release, you'll note that the NIM was absolutely flat or stable compared to the prior quarter, as reported. However, the NIM did benefit from a significant increase in income from the FDIC-covered loans, as I mentioned, due to faster prepayments and better performance than previously modeled. This improvement equaled about 70 basis points of NIM support. For the third quarter, we currently expect this benefit to revert back to a level similar to the first quarter. Although we ceased providing a core net interest income number, we did commit to giving you the components so that you could continue to calculate it. The additional accretion is found on the table of the bottom of -- the table at the bottom of Page 11, equaling $28.4 million. Discount amortization on subordinated debt was $12.2 million. Adjusting net interest income for these factors, there was about a $4 million linked quarter increase, which is explained by an additional day of interest income in the second quarter and\/or the growth in average loans.","In summary, we think that at the end of the analysis, net interest income was pretty stable, which is consistent with the outlook we've been giving you. Loan yields declined 12 basis points sequentially, which was attributable to the resetting of 5-year adjustable rate loans or loans with similar interest rate characteristics, as well as new production at spreads that reflect the competitive marketplace and also the reduced risk profile of customers, i.e. reduced risk equals lower spread to index. Securities yields increased slightly due primarily to the re-performance of some of the nonperforming or kicking payment-in-kinding of some of our CEOs. As long as the economy continues to remain fairly steady and slowly improve, we expect such re-performances to continue.","Turning now to noninterest income, fairly straightforward quarter, not a whole lot to comment on. Outside of the usually volatile gains\/losses on securities, we recognized about $2 million of income related to legal settlements in the sale of other assets. Those numbers are not particularly repeatable. We had a stronger quarter for service charges and loan fees due largely to a 17% linked to quarter increase in loan production volume and 8% annualized net increase in total commitments.","I think we detailed the CDO developments pretty well on the release. In summary, we're generally pleased with the way valuation is improving and the steady rate at which the bank collateral making up those CDOs is re-performing.","On the credit front, you can look at Pages 12 through 14. Harris has already commented on the generally strong improvements, but I'll add that nonaccrual loan inflows declined nearly 10% from the prior quarter to about $380 million annualized rate, which compares favorably to a nonaccrual loan balance of $516 million at quarter end. Basically the lower inflows bode well for continued future reductions in nonaccruals.","OREO inflows declined nearly 20% to an annualized rate of about $63 million. We resolved about 25% of total nonperforming assets during the quarter. The overwhelming majority ended up going our way, i.e. favorable resolutions reached a new high at 79% of total resolutions.","Turning now to capital, we were generally pleased with the result of our various offerings during the quarter, locking in a significant amount of long-term preferred equity at an average rate of -- dividend rate of less than 6%, as well as redeeming the higher cost Series B Trust-preferred securities. And we also retired about 50% of our very high-cost September 2014 maturity senior debt via a tender offer, and the subscription rate on that tender was much higher than we had originally hoped for or planned for. So we were pleased with that outcome. Both of those redemptions should lead to significantly reduced net interest costs in the quarters going forward.","The estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio on a Basel I basis, as Harris was mentioning, was largely unchanged from the prior quarter. As far as Basel III numbers go, we're still fine-tuning our estimates as Harris mentioned, but we currently believe that the Tier 1 common ratio will be roughly 9.2% if it were fully phased-in today. Also note that we've not yet made any decision about opting in or opting out of the AOCI mark treatment for us. With the CDO portfolio, that decision is a bit more complicated and it might be for some other regional banks, and also entails thinking about the total return swap or TRS. So we've not yet nearly completed that research.","Second and fairly unique to Zions, I will point out that there was a change made by the Federal Reserve between the notice of proposed rule-making and the final rule regarding the treatment of Trust-preferred securities will differentially impact us and will result in the deduction from Tier 1 capital, not common equity Tier 1, but Tier 1, of any amounts above approximately $450 million of the amortized cost of our bank and insurance trust preferred CDO securities. If fully phased in today, this would -- and I would emphasize that, fully phased in, it would result in a reduction of more than $1 billion of Tier 1 capital. Assuming that we issue an additional $200 million of perpetual preferred shares and subsequently call all of the Series C shares, which is about $800 million, Zions would have about $1 billion of non-common Tier 1 equity, and it has about $1.4 billion of bank and insurance Trust-preferred CDOs today. And therefore, we would eat up to 10% bucket plus about that $1 billion. There's -- those securities are paying down, and we project them to continue to pay down over the next coming quarters. So we actually do expect that impact to be mitigated over time through those paydowns and\/or through dispositions of some of the securities as liquidity returns to that market.","Finally, wrapping up with a bit of outlook guidance with regard to loan growth. With continued strength in loan pipelines and the increase in commitments in the last 6 months and our customers feeling a bit more optimistic, we expect a continued moderate loan growth over the 1-year horizon. We expect therefore that excluding the somewhat volatile interest income from FDIC-supported loans, we would expect net interest income to be fairly stable, at least in the next few months through a few quarters, with some continued pressure on loan yields being offset by the loan growth that I just mentioned.","Noninterest income, we would expect the less volatile components of noninterest income, such as service fees, to continue at a moderate upward trend. And with regard to noninterest expense, they're -- we think they're generally under control, but I will point out a couple of things that we mentioned in the earnings release. First, we've hired a number of consultants from several firms to help us upgrade our stress testing and capital planning processes to prepare for -- to get up to so-called CCAR standards. It was a little over $3 million in the second quarter, and we would expect continued similar amounts at least through the next couple of quarters and then begin to taper off probably in 2000 -- middle of 2014, depending upon the results of our CCAR stress test at the end of this year. Second is we also disclosed in some detail in the press release, we've decided to go ahead and launch a major upgrade to our core loan and deposit systems and accounting systems. We've been studying this for probably a couple of years now, thoroughly vetting different alternatives and different vendors. And we have pulled the trigger to go forward on those projects, although there are a number of off-reps or we can turn them off or scale them back if we don't like what we're seeing as we phase it in. But we will -- this will require the hiring of some additional staff in addition to the vendor and other professionals, and thus salaries and benefits in professional services are likely to increase from the current levels. We believe that much of the incremental costs can be offset by reduced so-called environmental costs, such as credit-related noninterest expenses and regulatory assessments and FDIC premiums and the like. As an additional offset to these expenses, as discussed earlier, we expect the FDIC indemnification expense to continue for about another year, averaging about $13 million per quarter, at which time the other noninterest expense line should run in the area of $60 million per quarter, which I believe is down somewhat from where it's been.","With regard to provision for credit cost, we expect the provision expense to remain low or negative for additional quarters. Continued reduction in problem credits and the ongoing improvement at loss severity rates have the potential to result in a negative provision as it has been in the last 3 quarters, even with some modest loan growth.","Finally, I want to comment on preferred stock dividends. They're expected to increase in the third quarter to approximately $31 million to reflect the full quarter of dividends on the Series H shares that we issued in May. In the fourth quarter, we expect the dividend to drop to a level more near $22 million. And that is -- number includes our contemplated issuance of an additional $200 million of preferred basically prior to the fourth -- so that most of that cost would be in the fourth quarter.","During 2014 in the foreseeable future, we would after that. And after our expected call of Series C expect -- anticipate a full year preferred dividend rate of around $60 million per year or slightly higher in a little bit of variation, depending upon the exact coupon or coupons that we achieved on the last $200 million of preferred that we expect to issue this year.","With that, I will pause and ask the operator to open up lines for questions. And we'll -- we've got about a little over half an hour to try to take as many of your questions as we can.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Levin from Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So if you look at the expenses, if you back out the $40 million through extinguishment costs, they ran around $411 million during the quarter. If you just went through a list of puts and takes, how do you see that $411 million trending over the next few quarters?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm -- you want to comment, James?","James R. Abbott","Well, Josh, I think with the core systems replacement project will begin to ramp up gradually, but it'll -- it's in effect at this point. We signed the contract and work has begun, so that's going to start to -- that'll start to appear at this point. It's official. The other credit-related costs that are partial offset to that continued to decline, and we've continued to see good performance on inflows and outflows of problem credits, so we're happy with that direction. And so there's just puts and takes, but I think it will -- and then the FDIC indemnification asset, of course, is a major driver of that $411 million that you mentioned, and that will be fairly quickly tapering down. We have about $51 million more of expense to go before that's gone, and that will be gone by the end of the third quarter of 2014.","Doyle L. Arnold","I would just comment that the only significant thing that we've kind of changed here is this core product. And if you -- and major, just rough ballpark numbers at this time, but if you take $200 million and say 1\/3 of that is capitalized, more or less, you're at kind of $130 million, $140 million a year -- over 5 years. So you're talking $25 million per year or $6 million per quarter. And that's ramping -- that won't all pop up instantly. It will ramp up over some number of quarters, probably several. So I don't think you're not looking at any significant spike up in total expenses. And as we noted, where credit-related costs and legal settlements and professional or legal services or -- and FDIC premiums should still trend down. So I don't think you're looking at a significant ramp-up in noninterest expense, if any, over the next year or so.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then on the loan growth side, you guys sounded more optimistic than a lot of your peers, which have been dialing back expectations. You said -- where do you attribute the difference? Is it just mostly the fact that you -- a small business is more optimistic than large business right now?","Doyle L. Arnold","I -- if you look at kind of what differentiates us from some of our peers, it is that we are more small- and middle-market business-oriented, and that's where we're seeing a lot of the activity. We have missed out on a number of larger deals because we won't match the pricing that some of the bigger banks are throwing out there on those deals. So I have not had a chance to listen to the color or in the commentary from many of our peers, but that probably is what distinguishes us.","Harris H. Simmons","Yes, Josh, I would just add. I mean, we -- our production on the small business really increased in the second quarter. It was a nice 25-or-so percent jump in terms of total volume coming out of the smaller-sized loans.","Doyle L. Arnold","New production?","Harris H. Simmons","Of new production compared to the production that we saw in the first quarter.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, that's not an annualized -- a 25% annual growth rate. That's just a jump in the new originations.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I guess the first question I had just on the FDIC-supported loan income that you're getting, I think I got most of your comments that you mentioned that the $50 million of amortization runs off by the end of the third quarter of '14. But should we expect that number, which I guess, was a net $6.6 million this quarter, it seems that you have basically twice as much income as amortization over the next 2 years. Is this a number that should run as sort of a 0 to net positive benefit for the next few quarters and then a more material positive in the back half of '14 and then into '15? How should we think about the net impact there?","Doyle L. Arnold","George, I think he's got it. No, I mean that's pretty much it. What we we're -- we were trying to highlight a couple of things and I'll let -- one is that it was an unusually large benefit this quarter. And there will still be a benefit next quarter, it just won't be as large. And yes, the expense kind of runs out before the benefit does, which will run for another year. So I think you've got it about right. Anything else, James?","James R. Abbott","No, that's it. We do expect in the third quarter of this year, so next quarter, next reporting quarter, we expect the revenue number to decline to about the $20 million area, maybe $21 million, $22 million. So it will be a fairly significant drop. But then you're right, after the indemnification asset expense is exhausted, it -- the revenue remains for a considerable period of time there, a year or 1.5 years before it -- it'll be -- come to an end. Pretax benefit is about $50 million to capital if you want to look at it instead of an earnings stream an accretion to capital. That will be another way to think about it.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. Perfect. And then just one last thing, on the CDO, in the section where you're talking about CDOs, it says you had $4.3 million loss on the sale of 6 CDOs. Should we read anything into that in terms of the market is becoming a little more liquid that you might try to sell some of the TruPS a little bit, or is that just kind of a one-off?","Doyle L. Arnold","I don't think the market is not yet liquid enough that we're likely to sell material amounts unless we see further improvement. But I mean one of the things that motivated us to do that was we did want to kind of test the pricing for -- on a variety of tranches at different points in the waterfall. They were directly securities that we own to make -- to kind of further validate our pricing of the whole portfolio. And so we selected 6 securities that were representative of various -- very, very different parts of our risk exposure. And generally I would just say, those prices tended to validate exactly what we've been doing.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credits Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just to come back to the investment in the loan and deposit system, Doyle, it sounded like you excluded the $67 million that you'll be capitalizing. I'm just wondering under GAAP accounting, doesn't this get depreciated? And won't you have an increase of depreciation expense of about $2 million a quarter from this?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, first of all, you're being much more precise than I was with my -- in getting it down to $67 million. Yes, it will be -- this will be amortized, but not -- that won't start until it's placed into service. And we don't anticipate the first probably loan system beginning to convert into -- well into year 2 of this project. So it's -- again, you're not going to see anything like an instant jump in that expense.","James R. Abbott","Yes, so [indiscernible] there is 2015. Mid-2015 or so was when you'd start to see some amortization expense, perhaps.","Doyle L. Arnold","You want to ask a follow-up on that one?","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, actually I do have a follow-up. And then turning back to the uncapitalized portion. It sounded like to the answer to your prior question some or most of that -- or maybe all that $6 million you targeted could show up in the third quarter. Is that correct, or am I a little early there?","Doyle L. Arnold","I think -- it's way early. I wish we could hire that many people that fast and get on with this. But no, that's -- it's going to ramp up a little more slowly than that, I believe. Maybe a couple of million in the third quarter but we're -- the final decision was made about 1 month ago, maybe -- well, I guess, more like 6 weeks ago, and so we're beginning to actively recruit, and we have hired some people. Some of the project leadership we've been hiring over the course of the first half of this year already. So some of the more expensive people, if you will, are already on board and then the numbers. But the rest of it will ramp up over the next few quarters, not 1 quarter.","Harris H. Simmons","This is Harris. I would also note that some of -- not all of this is incremental spend either. I mean, a fair amount of this resource is internal resources that are currently working on other things. And I don't want to suggest that there isn't net addition. There certainly will be, but some portion of it, and it's a little early to know how much is going to be offsetting -- offset by other projects that were maintaining some of these old systems, for example. There are also current costs associated with maintenance of the number of these systems that will, as we put the new into place, will also disappear. So it's not all new add. There are offsets, including some -- what we expect will be some reasonably significant productivity benefits as we get this in place.","Operator","The next question comes from Erika Penala from Bank of America.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is on the capital level that you mentioned, the adjustments under Tier 1, do you think it's that adjustment that's more important in terms of $1 billion hit that you mentioned Tier 1 capital, or is it the absolute level relative to the Basel III hurdle? I mean in other words, even if you unwind in the CDO portfolio more slowly, that shouldn't really -- that impact shouldn't really impact your capital return plans for 2014. Is that a good way to think about it or...","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, first of all, it's -- the impact is essentially entirely in noncommon Tier 1. That's kind of one point to make. Two, it is phased in over time. It's actually over 5 years. Third point that I would make is that if the phase-in for the non-globally active or internationally active systemic banks for this begins in 2015, that will -- that period is included in the upcoming CCAR forecast period. So it could begin to influence capital decisions in 2014 because it will be within the projection period. But beyond that, we haven't begun to do any analysis on that.","Operator","The next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I want to see if you can give us a little more color on loan growth in the quarter in terms of the drivers, more particularly around C&I. If you can give us some color on the regional breakout. How much of that came out of Texas, for example? And then a little bit more around the types of loans that you're seeing a nice pickup in demand.","Doyle L. Arnold","I will let James give you some of the color. He's picked up on talking around our franchise.","James R. Abbott","Sure. Thanks, Doyle. John, in terms of the companies, the C&I geographically, Zions Bank actually had about $120 million worth of net C&I growth. California Bank & Trust also had a very strong quarter at $132 million or $133 million. Amegy was at $23 million positive, so it was -- it had just many, many historically strong quarters. And this was a good quarter for them, but not as strong as it has been in some -- in the past. Nevada and Arizona actually one point that is probably worth making here is that Nevada seems to have turned the corner. Nevada had net positive loan growth for the quarter, in total about $39 million. But just the C&I portion of that was about $21 million. So it's Dallas Haun, our CEO there, is leading a good improvement in getting more C&I done and relying a little bit less on real estate there. I'll pause there if you have a follow-up question.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","No, no, that's helpful. And then on the commercial real estate side, I know you've been talking about an inflection in that portfolio. We're starting to see some there. I just wanted to get a better view of when you expect a material pickup there in the growth in those balances, particularly given the growth in the commitments that you see.","James R. Abbott","Well, I guess, I would comment a couple of things. One is prepayments, these have been pretty high on the term commercial real estate portfolio. And the impact from the 5- and 10-year Treasury moving higher is not reflected in the second quarter numbers. We may start to see some of that benefit of slower prepayment speeds in the third and fourth quarters if they remain up here. That would be hope, although the phrase is hope is a short comes to mind. The second thing that I would say on the construction and development, we still continue to see good commitment growth there. It's actually the commitment growth out of the construction and development teams this quarter came from a -- it was not all multifamily. So it was -- in fact, it was less -- far less than half was multifamily. It was -- industrial was a strong pickup this quarter for us, office, some retail. And so we're actually seeing a pretty diversified mix of production there. So that's a good story that we're happy to see that diversification. So the growth doesn't concern us there and is actually encouraging. And then in terms of balances outstanding, we would expect the construction portfolio to continue to grow at a reasonably good pace similar to the second quarter as we go throughout the third and fourth quarters.","Operator","The next question comes from Gaston Ceron from Morningstar Equity.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the question on the offsets for the spending project that you detailed. I was just a little confused because I think in your comments, you talked about how some of these can be reduced by, I think you said, so-called environmental costs and regulatory sub-spends and FDIC premiums and things like that. I guess what I'm trying to understand is these offsets, are they all related to the project, meaning the reason that this could be a cost offset or were some of these going to happen anyway?","Doyle L. Arnold","No, none of those things is related to the project. Those were things that were going to happen anyway. I was just trying to address the question of are we about to see -- I'll paraphrase the question that was, are we about to see ramp up in expenses after 3 years of really solid flat expense control by you guys? And the answer is -- the answer I try to give was no, you're not. But yes, there will be some incremental expense from this project. That's unavoidable. And we want to lay that out there. There will be some offsets directly attributable to this project. But the nature of the saves is that they come toward the back end -- back half of the project, whereas the spend starts immediately. But you can't get the first benefit until you actually turn on the first piece of the first system. And then the various expense savings, and we actually hope some revenue increase, occur -- ramp up over the back half of the project, kind of in years 3 through 5 to 7.","Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then lastly, just on a different subject, you talked about competition and I think you said something about that you're not willing to match your pricing offered by some of your competitors. I'm just trying to get some color on how rational or not, frankly, the competition is being in your view.","Doyle L. Arnold","I don't want to speculate on their own rationality. I'll just leave it at we're not trying to match that competition. We're not. I mean there's -- I guess, the areas where we're consciously being less competitive are probably large C&I loans and long-term CRE loans, 20, 25 years where the pricing from securities, markets and government-sponsored entities, et cetera, is just too thin for us to want to take on that interest rate risk. And that's why despite James' comments about hope, I think that over the rest of this year, we're probably likely to see some continued CRE term declines that will offset the construction and development CRE growth partially offset it just like we did this quarter. I think that's kind of the best outlook for next couple of quarters. And remember, we've been -- I think we've been very clear about this, too. We've made a strategic decision in this company not to let the CRE portfolio grow back to anything like the proportion of the total portfolio that was in circa 2006 and '07. We will be cautious about letting that growth get too carried away.","James R. Abbott","I was just going to add, if you look at capital as a scarce resource, which it is, and if you can get more than 100 basis points on the smaller loans, it's probably a good trade. If there's a little bit of higher costs associated with that, with doing the small loans because you don't get as many -- we have more employees that you could point to and say, well, you have more employees and that's -- it does require more infrastructure to do the small lending that we do. But it's a much, much higher yield.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Marty Mosby from Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you 2 questions. One is pretty simple. The Fab transactions on the capital side you completed this quarter. I'm estimating $0.04 to $0.05 of quarterly positive with most of that kind of showing up as we come moving to the third of fourth quarter. Is that about right?","Harris H. Simmons","Some of that's about right. You're probably about right there. Some of that is certainly recognized in the second quarter, Marty, and -- but we -- for example, Trust preferreds were done at the beginning of May. So we've got 2 months under our belt there, but we've got another month's worth of benefit to realize on average balanced basis. The senior debt was done really later in the quarter and so we -- that benefit will not really -- was not in the second quarter. And we'll get most of that in the third quarter, so that's right.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The total amount is about right, though, about $0.04?","Harris H. Simmons","I think it's right, yes.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Doyle, as you go through this system change and overhaul on the deposit side and then looking at what's you're doing on both of your kind of your front ends here, are you going to be able to take off the shelf a package that you can kind of plug in or you'll -- because this project is so long in duration, are you really tailoring this and doing a lot of internal work that creates a little bit more risk as you're kind of going through the development process?","Doyle L. Arnold","Good question. The answer is more I think toward the former. The system that we are going to implement is a modern integrated banking system that is used in probably by I think it's something like a couple hundred institutions around the world. Parts of it are used on Wall Street, but we would be the first U.S. implementation of a full integrated system. So there has to be some customization of that system for the U.S. market. The vendor, Tata or TCS, is obliged to undertake that on their own nickel. That's not our cost. We will, on the other hand, have to work with them and incur some costs to basically implement our product set and our operating methods on their system as you would with any other platform. But our overall goal here is to minimize the amount of customization that we have to do and pay for as we go through this rollout.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's good to hear. Our past experience has been the more you try to develop yourself, first panel plug in with an engine that already works really, especially at the amount of time you're talking about it, it tends to really increase the risk of the projects so that's -- we fairly agree.","Doyle L. Arnold","We are keenly aware of that, and have had numerous discussions internally about that and we'll institute kind of escalation processes to make sure that customizations requested by our banks, as we implement this are vetted at basically, the highest levels of the company before we go forward. There's a whole lot of reasons to -- including risk, but also including giving up future flexibility to take ongoing upgrade and whatnot that you got to be careful of. And therefore, we very much want to avoid as much customization as we can.","Operator","The next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So Doyle, can you give us some thoughts on how long you think credit cost net charge-offs are going to stay unusually low? This has been source of upside for the group for a while. I'm just wondering about your opinion on how long your loan losses are going to stay so low.","Doyle L. Arnold","James has indicated -- I mean, he wants to answer that question. And then I'll reserve the right to ratify or contradict whatever he is about to say.","James R. Abbott","We -- Jennifer, it's a good question. We actually -- I asked the same question of our Credit Administration folks, and I said, \"We've had very successful recovery so far. What is the likelihood that those recoveries will continue?\" Because the growth charge-offs are not -- I mean they're great. They're at very good level, but it's not what's driving the 6 basis points. It's the recovery side. And they did a fairly detailed analysis loan type by loan type. And as any analysis, it's not perfect and there are assumptions that were made. But we do think that the recoveries are -- we're nearing the end -- we're probably maybe 7 inning on the recoveries. We still have $15 million to $20 million more recoveries per quarter is the best guess coming out of our Credit Admin group for the next couple of quarters but then it does start to tail down based on when we charge it off and how much more exposure we have in those loans. So if you normalize the recoveries, you're probably back to the 30-basis-point to 40-basis-point net charge-off range, and I think that's fairly consistent with some of the concentration risk metrics we've put in place to keep us out of the loan types that cause problems, the stress testing keeps -- helps us keep an eye on, which loan types cost us the most in terms of financial charge-offs, so we're actively avoiding those, and just net, overall, better credit quality from our customers. Want a detail or...?","Doyle L. Arnold","No, I'll first just state that James is going to keep his job, so you can continue to dial 801-844. Anyway, but I would -- the only -- I think James was spot on in what he described, which was what's the likely pattern of net charge-offs. If you're -- by credit costs, you're really getting to provision or lack thereof, I would say, basically, it's not at all how we get there, but net recoveries have driven a lot of the negative provision. They kind of -- the numbers are roughly similar orders of magnitude. But the underlying metrics of classified loans and loss severity and whatnot also continue to improve. So you take away the recoveries. If those begin to wane after another couple of quarters, maybe you're back to something like a 0 provision for a while, but you're probably not back to a significant positive provision for a couple more quarters after that, unless loan growth begins to pick up more significantly. Was that helpful?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] It looks like we do have one more question from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones here at the end, can you talk about what the all-in loan production rate was for the quarter? And if you have, then the rates you're getting on the large C&I and the smaller C&I loans?","James R. Abbott","So from a rate perspective on various loan types, on the C&I, I'll just give you that it was relatively stable versus the prior quarter. It was down 4 basis points. It's in the high 3s when you look at the all-in yields on below -- on the C&I production. You could talk to other banks out there and find out what loan pricing is on large loans, and you'll get probably a LIBOR plus 200. And so that will give you some sort of sense as to the fact that we're not doing a lot of large loans.","Doyle L. Arnold","And I'm not sure what you're -- what metric you're asking us to divulge or just talk about on. Did you say gross production? Because that's kind of a weird number because as we calculate because it includes renewals and totally new loans in that -- what were you asking about there, Dave?","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just the all-in loan production rate, generally speaking. And then you talked about the large C&I rates coming in on the production side a little bit more during...","Doyle L. Arnold","All-in production rate, you mean the rate on new production or the dollar?","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on all product types. So what you produced in the quarter?","Harris H. Simmons","All product types was in -- about 3.85%, and that's a number we've given out historically. So that makes sense, if that's what you're asking us. We were at 3.87% last quarter. We were at 3.85% this quarter.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. And then just a quick question for Doyle on the liquidity side, what do you need to see in the long end of the curve for you to become more interested in plowing at least a portion of that excess cash in the securities?","Doyle L. Arnold","We're just not likely to plow a lot of it into securities because again our basic belief is that as the economy improves, 2 things will happen. One is that loan production will continue to trend upward and at some point, the noninterest-bearing DDA balances that have largely been funding this cash are going to begin to be withdrawn because -- and for the same reason as companies get more optimistic, they will plow first -- some will plow their own money into expansion, withdrawing their cash balances. Others will borrow. And so our basic business is taking deposits and making loans, not taking deposits and buying long-dated securities. So...","James R. Abbott","Doyle's last call request generated a lot more patrons to the bar, I guess, if we use the analogy. So let's take 1 question but no follow-ups from the next couple of people here. Let's got to Steve Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Doyle, I just wanted to ask, I don't know if you gave this out but what is the pro forma Tier 1 capital ratio for the final NPR?","Doyle L. Arnold","Tier 1 as opposed to CET1?","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As opposed to Tier 1 common.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, again if they were fully phased in today, and I want to emphasize that, those numbers would be fairly similar. Kind of in the -- that one would also be in the low 9.2% to maybe a little bit higher than that depending on exactly where we came out. But we -- as we actually get closer to the date, we think that they will divulge, but yes, it would be -- that's what -- you hit on. That's exactly what we're trying to convey that the way that rule was written, that's where the most significant impact to us would be, not on common equity Tier 1 but on noncommon Tier 1.","Operator","The next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I just, I guess, circling back, just wanted to confirm on this guidance for relatively stable net interest income does include kind of all the capital refinances actions you've done and the planned issuance in the second or the third quarter, whatever. And will that $12 million sub debt amortization start to tail off at some point?","James R. Abbott","The subordinated debt. So as the subordinated debt is cold -- or matures, not cold. But as that matures, it will go to 0. But between now and then, it actually increases ever so slightly every quarter. Probably, it goes from $12 million this quarter to $13 million next quarter, and $14 million this quarter after that and so forth.","Doyle L. Arnold","It was not a straight line amortization. It was -- what is that, the level of yield and method of amortization. So it kind of starts off lower and then ends up higher.","James R. Abbott","And the stable net interest income outlook is -- we still do, based on all the modeling that we've done, we still expect a significant amount of -- well, we've given you what the loan yields are coming on at, and you know what the loan yields are on the average balance sheet. So you can see some of the pressure that we're facing there.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Thomas on behalf of Paul. Doyle, I know you guys talked about liquidity on the CDOs, but can you talk a little bit about the pace at which you've seen banks sort of buying back their own TruPS, and whether you think the pace of that sort of continues to increase from here as the economy improves.","Doyle L. Arnold","What we've actually -- we've seen the large banks where the TruPS are being phased out as Tier 1, certainly that's picked up. Among the small banks, we did see some uptick over the last year, but it's not consistent, and we would actually expect, given the final rule does not phase out Trust-preferred as Tier 1 capital for smaller banks that, that rate of redemption might well slow down, meaning more which -- it has mixed impact on us, but it basically means more cash flow for longer, which means the mezzanine tranches that we own probably do somewhat better than we might have otherwise forecast.","Operator","The last question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","James, just the last thing on that front, on the point you just made a little bit ago about where loans are coming on versus where they're coming off. Can you give us an update of kind of where the floors are? How much of the book still has floors against it and how much of that is that burden of the higher versus lower?","James R. Abbott","That's not a number I have at my fingertips right now. My best guess will be about 5 -- sorry, between 10 and 15 basis points of margin support right now, and that's a very significant portion of what we -- when we model these loans running off or running down or resetting that's a big piece of it. The loans are going away or the floor is going away.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So is it fair to say -- do you have a line of sight on at what point you're think that crossover point happens?","Doyle L. Arnold","You mean at what point the floors are no longer supporting the margin?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Well, at what point do you kind of get even on what's coming on versus what's coming off because knowing you're still down 12 basis points this quarter because of this burden, so I'm just wondering kind of how much longer do we have until that -- forgetting the spread side of it, just on the asset yield side of it, when you get to that bottoming out point naturally.","James R. Abbott","Well, the models are -- is doing -- these are very expensive models and they've got thousands of assumptions in them and every quarter, they spit out basically sometimes different numbers. And so prior to the pricing competition we saw in January, February time frame, we thought the margin would trough in the third quarter thereabouts. And the models are now looking at basically fourth or first quarter trough at this point.","Okay. Well, thank you for all of you for joining us today. Thanks, Jamie, for managing the call for us as well, and we will be in touch with you throughout the quarter at conferences and whatnot, and feel free to give us a call at any time and we'll try to answer your questions.

You\u2019ve joined Zions Bancorporation\u2019s First Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James Abbott","Good evening, and thank you, Latif. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2019 first quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial performance; after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions\u2019 financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook for the next four quarters. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer.","Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full release \u2013 earning release as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com and we\u2019ll be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including the pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, both of which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures.","A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour. During the question-and-answer session of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thank you very much, James, and we welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our first quarter results. The results for the quarter were fundamentally quite favorable compared to the year ago results. Slide 3 is a summary of several of the key highlights for the quarter, which we\u2019ll address in detail in subsequent slides.","On Slide 4, you can see the earnings per share results for the last several quarters. In the first quarter of 2019, we reported earnings per share of $1.04. By way of comparison in the first quarter last year, we reported $1.09, although there were a couple of items worth noting.","First, we experienced a $47 million negative provision for loan losses a year ago that amounted to $0.17 per share. Additionally, in the first quarter of last year, we recovered interest income on four large loans, where the recovery per loan was more than $1 million. And those recoveries added $0.04 per share to the year ago results with no comparable large interest recoveries this year.","So excluding those two items in the year ago period, earnings per share would have increased 18%. To be fair, many of the larger banks, including Zions had a modest tailwind related to elimination of the FDIC insurance, surcharge expense this quarter. In the year ago quarter, that surcharge amounted to about $0.02 per share, whereas the surcharge didn\u2019t occur in the first quarter of 2019.","Turning to Slide 5. On the left side, you\u2019ll see adjusted pre-provision net revenue or PPNR, which increased approximately 8% over the same period a year ago. The chart on the right is new. As you\u2019re aware, a new accounting standard for loan loss allowances, CECL or current expected credit losses, is expected to go into place to take effect in the first quarter of 2020.","Paul Burdiss will address that a bit more later in this call. But we are concerned as we suspect many of you are about the comparability of results arising from the new standard across banks. In this chart, we\u2019re presenting a calculation that we\u2019ve been using to measure the performance of our company and incentive compensation calculations for employees for quite sometime. It\u2019s pre-provision net revenue less current period actual net charge-offs.","We\u2019ve expressed this pre-tax number here on a per-share basis. Assisted by a strong 7% reduction in diluted shares and further improvement in net charge-offs, PPNR less net charge-offs per share increased 18% over the year ago period and 128% from the end of 2014.","Allow me to transition to a discussion of strategy for the next few moments. Just last week, we announced by way of a press release our successful implementation of what we call Release 2 of our FutureCore project. That\u2019s a project wherein we\u2019re replacing all of our core loan and deposit systems. This Release 2 milestone completes the conversion of our loan systems that are within the scope of the project.","This is really a tremendous accomplishment that\u2019s required years of planning and intense work to execute it. The modern technology we\u2019re \u2013 that we\u2019re implementing will serve us for years to come and will allow us to more nimbly adapt digital offerings and to reliably serve our customers.","As we\u2019ve said in the past, but it\u2019s worth repeating, a major strategic initiative for the company is the development of technology that enables us to stay highly competitive with large national banks, small and emerging financial technology companies and community banks. We\u2019re simultaneously working to maintain our noninterest expense growth rate in the low single digits, made possible in part by continued simplification and automation.","On Slide 6, you can see some of the key technology investments we\u2019re making, approximately the number of customers, deposits or assets held by such customers had a rough timeframe for completing those projects. The green checkmark \u2013 the green checkmarks rather represent completed projects.","I\u2019ll conclude my prepared remarks with Slide 7, which is a list of our key objectives for 2019 and 2020 and our commitment to shareholders. This has been updated to reflect some new initiatives that should set our course for the next several quarters.","First, over the next several quarters, we expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage, resulting in high single-digit PPNR growth through the actions listed on page. This assumes no changes to interest rates by the Federal Open Market Committee.","Second, we have continued to take steps to dampen potential volatility in our earnings, both regard \u2013 with regard to credit as well as interest rate risk. We have talked extensively in the past about how our credit risk profile has changed. Furthermore, we are actively adjusting our interest rate risk profile to move towards a more neutral stance as Paul will discuss in more detail later.","Next, we expect further growth in earnings and improvement in our profitability. There has been some discussion by industry observers some of who \u2013 whom think the banking industry is at \u2013 is approaching peak earnings. I won\u2019t comment on the industry, but we don\u2019t think that Zions is at peak earnings.","We also believe we have some further room to optimize our capital ratios supported by our internal stress tests. The decision on the magnitude, timing and form of capital return is a Board-level decision and we\u2019ll update you on any of those decisions as appropriate.","Finally, as noted in my 2018 letter to shareholders that was recently published on our website, we\u2019re intending to invest materially in enhancing the branch experience, not with Coffee and doughnuts, but with highly trained bankers who can solve problems that small businesses experience.","This approach is supported by research, which is consistently found that small businesses continue to rank at conveniently located branch and access to an account officer as the top two features, which \u2013 for which they look when they\u2019re considering a bank.","So with that overview, I\u2019m going to turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financial statement in more detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. Thank you for joining us.","I\u2019ll begin on Slide 8. This highlights two measures of profitability: return on assets and return on tangible common equity. As Harris noted in his comments, pertaining to our earnings per share, there were some notable items in the year ago period, namely the negative provision for credit losses and interest recoveries on loans previously charged-off. These served to elevate the profitability ratios as well.","Excluding these two items, the return on assets in the year go quarter would have been approximately 1.17% and return on tangible common equity would have been approximately 12.5%.","We are generally pleased with the recent trends in balance sheet profitability. Although the rate of improvement has slowed from the successes achieved in 2015 through 2017, we expect positive operating leverage to combine with solid credit performance and continued strong capital returns to result in further expansion of balance sheet profitability.","On Slide 9, for the first quarter of 2019, Zions net interest income increased 6% from the prior year period, up $34 million to $576 million. Excluding the interest recoveries recognized in the first quarter of 2018 that were detailed earlier in this presentation, net interest income increased about 8.5%. We did experience a moderate benefit from the higher interest rate environment, which I will discuss later in more detail, but much of the growth in net interest income is attributable to balance sheet growth.","Breaking down the net interest income by both rate and volume, on Slide 10, you can see our average loan growth of 5% relative to the year ago period. Although not listed on the slide, the period-end growth in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter was an annualized 7.6%.","Shifting the discussion to deposits. Given the recent increases in short-term interest rates, we are pleased with the performance of our deposit portfolio. Average deposits increased 4% from the year ago period. Importantly, average noninterest bearing deposits were relatively stable, decreasing only 0.8% from the year ago period.","Relative to the prior quarter, average noninterest bearing deposits declined about 4% and period-end noninterest bearing deposits declined a more tempered 1.6%. We believe that some, but likely not all of the decline in noninterest bearing deposits is explained by seasonality.","The most valuable deposits are those which are generated through strong relationship banking and the strength of our banking relationships is demonstrated through continued growth and deposit balances, combined with a relatively modest increase in deposit costs.","Our cumulative increase in the cost of total deposits since the third quarter of 2015 that is immediately preceding the first rate hike by the Federal Reserve has been only 33 basis points or a deposit repricing beta relative to the federal funds rate of about 15%. When compared to the prior quarter, our deposit costs increased 8 basis points, or about a 36% of the change in the Fed funds rate, which is fairly similar to what we saw in the previous quarter.","Examining loan growth a bit closer, Slide 11 depicts year-over-year period-end loan growth by portfolio type, with the size of the circles representing the relative size of the portfolio. For nearly all loan categories, we are reporting solid and consistent growth. You will also find our current growth outlook for each loan portfolio type on Slide 11","Slide 12 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. The top line is the loan yield, which increased to 4.93%, up 14 basis points from the prior quarter and 52 basis points from the year ago quarter when adjusted for the aforementioned interest recoveries. That improvement is consistent with a portfolio that has nearly 50% of loans indexed to either prime or short-term LIBOR.","Relative to the prior quarter, the yield on securities increased 11 basis points to 2.57%. The primary factor driving the increase in securities yield is new securities being added in the 3% area during the quarter and premium amortization remaining stable relative to the prior quarter, which was modestly accretive to the yield of the overall investment portfolio.","With the recent decline in yields at the five-year point of the curve, we expect security reinvestments to be slightly less accretive going forward. Cash flow from the portfolio \u2013 the investment portfolio continues to be about $200 million per month. This is important, because even as rates have moved higher, cash flow from the portfolio remains comparable to levels we experienced several quarters ago. This demonstrates some level of this \u2013 of success in our efforts to limit duration extension risk in the securities portfolio.","The cost of total funds, which includes all deposits and borrowed funds, increased 13 basis points from the prior quarter, while the cost of interest bearing funds increased by 17 basis points over the same period. When compared to the prior year, these increases are 34 basis points for total funds and 54 basis points for interest bearing funds, respectively.","This differential in the cost of total borrowed funds versus interest bearing funds demonstrates the value of noninterest bearing demand deposits in a higher interest rate environment. These elements combined to result in a net interest margin of 3.68% for the quarter, which increased 1 basis point from the prior quarter.","Year-over-year, if excluding the 7 basis points of interest recoveries from the prior period, the net interest margin expanded 19 basis points, resulting in a net interest margin beta of approximately 20% over the prior year.","As noted previously, one of the more substantial drivers of this margin expansion is the increasing value of noninterest bearing deposits in a higher-rate environment. Because of the nature of our deposits being operating accounts for businesses and households, we expect our noninterest bearing deposits to remain a competitive advantage.","I will also highlight that the spread on average interest earning assets shown on Page 15 of the earnings release, if adjusted for the previously discussed 7 basis points and interest recoveries recognized in the prior period, has decreased by 3 basis points from the prior period. The difference between the slight net interest spread compression and the net interest margin expansion is due to the contribution from noninterest bearing sources of funds.","Slide 13 typically reside in the appendix, but I wanted to highlight in my prepared remarks, because somewhat investor interest in the hedging we are doing to protect against a decline in short-term interest rates. As we announced three months ago, we\u2019ve begun to moderate our asset sensitivity position as the recent trend of increasing short-term rates matures.","You\u2019ll see that, we added $3 billion of interest rate floors and $700 million of interest rate swaps during the quarter. As with other balance sheet composition changes taken \u2013 undertaken over the past several years, such as capital distributions and moving cash into investment securities, we expected to change our interest rate positioning at a measured pace.","Finally, we expected our short-term interest rates to remain relatively stable, the net interest margin should be likewise relatively stable, driven by factors such as longer maturity loan repricing and securities portfolio cash flow reinvestment. The key risk to this outlook remains deposit flows and pricing.","Next, a brief review of noninterest income on Slide 14. Noninterest income and specifically customer-related fees remains a focus for us and we are \u2013 and we experienced growth in loan fees, fees earned from sales of interest rate swaps, which help our customers manage their interest rate risk, letters of credit and wealth management services.","However, that \u2013 those income \u2013 net income was offset by declines in some categories of deposit fees, including the effect of higher earnings credit rates on commercial customer deposit balances. Additionally, we experienced a modest decline in service charges on certain retail and small business products.","Before we discuss noninterest expense, which is on Slide 15, I would like to note a key change in the presentation of our financial results. This quarter and going forward, we have moved the provision for unfunded lend \u2013 lending commitments, which previously was reported as noninterest expense, up closer to net interest income to be right next to the allowance for loan losses, thus, presenting a combined allowance for credit losses and netting that against net interest income.","As a result, the provision for unfunded lending commitments is no longer in our noninterest expense line. Noting that, noninterest expenses increased to $430 million from $419 million in the year ago quarter.","As depicted on the slide, we reported an increase in compensation, much of which is due to increased profitability and very good credit quality. Also in the first quarter of 2019, we increased some key benefits to employees, which are detailed more thoroughly in Harris\u2019s letter to shareholders and all of which are designed to appropriately reward our team for significantly improved financial performance.","Notably, it\u2019s worth mentioning that FDIC insurance premiums are down when compared to last year, as the FDIC surcharge for large banks has been eliminated. This results in a roughly $6 million reduction for Zions, which I discussed in last quarter\u2019s call.","Looking forward on noninterest expense, we are reiterating our expectation for slight growth, which can be interpreted as growth in the low single-digit percentage rate change \u2013 range.","Turning to Slide 16, the efficiency ratio was 60.2%, compared to the year ago period of 61.3%. The efficiency ratio calculations have some seasonality to them in that there are more days of interest income in the second-half of the year than the first and, of course, the seasonal expense increased in the first quarter of each year related to payroll taxes and stock-based compensation. We remain committed to continued improvement in our efficiency ratio in 2019.","Regarding credit quality, as seen on Slide 17, we continue to report improvement in most of our credit indicators, including a strong decline from the year ago figures in classified loans, nonperforming assets and the net charge-off picture. Even as the gross charge-off picture as seen on Page 13 of earnings release is quite strong.","Compared to the prior quarter, we reported a slight bump up in classified loans attributable to one credit, but outside of that we continue to experience improvement in oil and gas classifieds and general stability in the other categories.","Nonperforming assets plus 90 days past due improved by 7% versus the prior quarter, and net charge-offs for the quarter were zero. The allowance for loan losses ratio as a percentage of loans was largely stable with the prior quarter, with most of the provision attributable to increase in loans.","Looking ahead, we are on schedule to be compliant with the new current expected credit last accounting standard, also known as CECL, which will be effective at this time next year. Based upon our modeling, we expect more volatility in a credit loss estimate and less comparability among banks when this new standard becomes effective.","This is expected to \u2013 this expected decrease in financial performance transparency will be impacted by, among other items, varying expectations for macroeconomic trends over the near-term and loan portfolio composition differences, including expected loan lives. Zions will be in a position to disclose more in the coming quarters, including estimated financial impacts from the adoption of CECL.","Finally, on Slide 19, we depict our financial outlook for the next 12 months relative to the first quarter of 2019. We increased our outlook for loan growth to somewhat to moderately increasing, given the recent strength in net loan additions. Otherwise, there are no significant changes to our outlook from that which was and has been reported throughout the first quarter of 2019.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good evening, guys.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","I was just hoping to actually stay on the loan growth topic. Paul, I know you just hit the very end of your prepared remarks mentioned, it sounds like the improved outlook was due to sort of what you\u2019ve already seen. But I was hoping you could actually talk about what you\u2019re seeing in 2Q in terms of loan growth?","And I also want to make sure I just understand. Your outlook is moderately increasing, which is better than what it was before and that applies for the next 12 months. It seems that your loan growth outlook should be kind of better than on an already higher first quarter balance. Is that the right way of thinking about it?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll ask Scott and maybe Harris to chime in. First of all, with respect to the second quarter, it\u2019s so early in the quarter, it\u2019s really hard for us to make any meaningful commentary on that topic. But as you point out, we have through the language we\u2019re using, we\u2019ve tried to telegraph a, I would say, kind of a slight increase or improvement in our loan growth outlook relative to what we saw in the prior quarter. And as I said in my prepared remarks, that\u2019s largely because of the kind of the engagement and the strength that we\u2019re seeing in net loan portfolio additions.","Scott, would you like to add anything?","Scott McLean","Yes. Ken, I would \u2013 I just add that if you look at Slide 22, and basically, our year-over-year growth rates running kind of mid-5s. The first quarter annualized is a bit faster. We\u2019ve been guiding towards mid single-digit loan growth for three, four years now and sometimes it\u2019s going to kind of 3.5 years to four, and sometimes it may get up to six to seven.","But I think it\u2019s still very much in the band that we\u2019ve talked about. And the growth that we\u2019re seeing really is very consistent with the last \u2013 the previous two quarters and the last three or four years, basically 40%, 50% of it\u2019s coming from C&I. We\u2019re seeing some CRE growth, but the CRE portfolio is still really hasn\u2019t grown much if you go back 15 to 18 months, and then really solid growth from one to four family that generally makes up about 20% \u2013 25% of our growth rate.","We\u2019re also seeing really nice growth across all our affiliates depending on the quarter. But I would say, more consistent growth coming from our four smaller affiliates than we\u2019ve seen historically. So just good balance growth.","Ken Zerbe","All right. [Multiple Speakers]","Scott McLean","I would \u2013 as you can see here that, I guess, two other sub-portfolios, municipal has been growing nicely over the last two years as a result of the strategic initiatives we\u2019ve had there and should continue to grow. Again, it\u2019s really a nice yielding loan type and really high credit quality, where ancillary business is starting to flow from it. And our energy portfolio recall that it went from about $3 billion in outstandings down to about $2 billion \u2013 a little less than $2 billion.","We\u2019re now back up about $300 million and we\u2019re very happy with that loan growth. The energy portfolio is about $2.3 billion, and the mix has shifted significantly. Oilfield services was about 45% at the peak, it\u2019s now about 22%. And our energy services term loans, which is where we had the greatest loss rate, they\u2019re now less than $400 million. So it\u2019s a really good mix shift there and most of our new findings are going into reserve base and midstream.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. And just my related follow-up. Can you just talk a little bit about your outlook for deposit price increases now that the Fed as far as we\u2019ve done raising rates?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Ken,. I\u2019ll start with that and allow again Scott or Harris to jump in. We\u2019re really excited about the performance of our portfolio over the course of this rate cycle. That being said, we have seen a modest acceleration in the deposit repricing over the last couple of quarters.","My expectation is, with the flatness of the curve and with the Fed appearing to be sort of on pause maybe indefinitely here as it relates to rate increases, the further we get away from the event of Fed tightening. My expectation is that the pressure that we\u2019ve been seeing on deposit pricing will begin to abate over the next couple of quarters.","Ken Zerbe","Gotcha. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Paul Burdiss","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Rochester","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Dave.","David Rochester","Just on the outlook slide, you guys have mentioned here your efforts to reduce payoff activity. I was just wondering what steps you guys are taking on that fund, if that was what helped the growth this quarter versus maybe a pickup an origination activity?","Scott McLean","Yes. Dave, this is Scott McLean. We did see a higher success rate in retaining CRE term loans and as opposed to them being refinanced into the secondary market. And so \u2013 and then, it \u2013 Michael, you may recall the number, but I think it was a $300 million to $400 million sort of benefit during the quarter. And so nice progress, and we really haven\u2019t seen that kind of progress on that front, but we got a little more aggressive in marketing to those more earlier in the renewal process.","David Rochester","Okay, great. That\u2019s a good color. And then I know you said, it\u2019s early in 2Q. But are you continuing to see momentum in the loan pipeline heading into 2Q at this point just given what you\u2019re seeing so far that\u2019s sort of locked in to close?","Scott McLean","Again, it\u2019s too early to comment. But we\u2019ve really \u2013 since the third quarter of last year, late second quarter of last year all the way through the end of the year and through the first quarter, we\u2019re just seeing good balance growth and we anticipate that to continue.","David Rochester","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Harris Simmons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Usdin","Well, wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the hedging strategies that you discussed in the deck and earlier. So how much way through your planned hedging program are you? And can you talk a little bit about whether you\u2019re either benefiting from putting on those hedges now, or have to amortize a little bit of cost and is that baked into your outlook? Thanks.","Harris Simmons","Yes. Ken, I\u2019ll start with the second part. With the flatness of the curve, there\u2019s clearly no benefit to putting hedges on today. In fact, it\u2019s a modest \u2013 very modest immaterial, which is why I didn\u2019t say it, kind of a modest reduction in net interest income.","But with respect to the program itself, we do not have a \u2013 the ALCO, that is the Asset Liability Management Committee, doesn\u2019t have a specific target in mind other than the expectation is, we will in the near-term, at least, continue to work down that interest sensitivity.","And specifically, as I said on the call, we are particularly concerned with falling interest rates. And when you consider the behavior of our deposit pricing over the course of the last couple of years, you can see where in a decline in rates, the deposits could floor out pretty quickly. Our concern, of course, is that we\u2019ve become very asset sensitive in a falling rate environment, which is why you saw in addition to the swaps, why you saw us put $3 billion of rate floors on, because affectively that would be offsetting the impact of the deposit pricing in a falling rate environment.","So I would say\u2026","Kenneth Usdin","Okay.","Harris Simmons","\u2026we\u2019re kind of trying to be a little more specific. And to your question, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re still pretty early on in the hedging process with a lot more to come.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. And a follow-up on the mix of the balance sheet. You mentioned the outlook slightly declining securities portfolio balances. Up till now, you\u2019ve been funding using the deposit growth to fund both loans and securities. Are you now with a point, where you\u2019ll remix a little bit more on the asset side, just funding loan growth more incrementally with securities rather than necessarily paying up for more deposit growth? Just want to understand what you\u2019re thinking about that? Thanks.","Harris Simmons","Sure. Our securities portfolio exists, as I\u2019ve discussed previously; first, demand liquidity and second, demand interest rate risk. And so, our priority is ensuring that we have an investment securities portfolio that is adequate to maintain liquidity on the balance sheet.","But all that being said, obviously, there is a cost to liquidity. And so we\u2019re measuring or monitoring that very closely. As loan growth has really begun to exceed deposit growth, where going back and looking our investment portfolio and really ensuring that it is of the appropriate size. And so, my expectation certainly is that the portfolio will not grow from here and, in fact, will likely on either an absolute or relative basis will decline a little bit.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Harris Simmons","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your question please.","John Pancari","Good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hey, John.","John Pancari","On the margin side, I know that you had indicated for \u2013 your expectation for net interest income to be moderately increasing. Given that outlook, I mean, can you talk about how that plays out in terms of the margin trajectory from here? I believe you have previously expected some stability here on out, but clearly, you\u2019ve got the swap impact and the impact of the curve. So want to get an idea how you\u2019re thinking about the trajectory of the margin from here?","Paul Burdiss","Sure. On the interest rate hedging, as I said, we\u2019re really not seeing benefit \u2013 certainly not seeing a benefit, but we\u2019re really not seeing a good traction from the margin either, at least, in the current environment. Now all that being said, in my prepared remarks, I mentioned net interest margin stability as we see some kind of repricing in the loan portfolio and especially in the securities portfolio. But the key to that outlook is deposit pricing and deposit flows.","And so as long as we can continue to maintain appropriate share of noninterest bearing demand deposits and so long as the interest bearing portion of the deposits, remains consistent \u2013 priced consistently with our expectations. And importantly, as long as we don\u2019t get seriously out of whack in the balance of loan growth and deposit growth, kind of all of those are implied assumptions in that margin stability, and there\u2019s probably more risk to the downside than the upside in the current environment.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. [Multiple Speakers]","Paul Burdiss","But all that being said, if I \u2013 sorry, John, if I could. All that being said, I \u2013 we are really focused on growth in net interest income and growth in revenue. And so, we don\u2019t specifically manage to the margin, as you know. We\u2019re far more concerned with revenue growth than the margin, which is a kind of an indication of relative profitability.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. And then separately on the expense side, the efficiency ratio, I know you indicated you expect the continued improvement in positive operating leverage as well. Can you talk about how you think about it for full-year 2019? Could it still come in below the \u2013 we\u2019re still expecting below 60% range. And then long-term, I know you\u2019ve indicated mid-50s. Is that still a fair assumption? And what do you think about the timing until when you can get into that mid-50 range? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Sure. Well, in 2018, as you know, we did report efficiency ratio that was below 60%. And in my prepared remarks, I mentioned that we\u2019re expecting continued improvement. So you glue those pieces together and you can see that our expectation is for an efficiency ratio that\u2019s below 60% in 2018. I absolutely think that, it\u2019s achievable to get into the mid-50s.","I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have nor we put out a kind of a timeframe associated with that. But we\u2019re really focused on as we think about our plans and our forecast. We\u2019re really focused on positive operating leverage and the degree to which we can increase that leverage absolutely affects the timeline that will \u2013 we will be able to achieve that efficiency ratio outcome.","John Pancari","Okay. Thanks, Paul.","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Bradley Jason Milsaps","Hey, good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Brad.","Bradley Jason Milsaps","Scott, I was curious if you could maybe offer a little more color on the loan growth specifically in Texas? It looks like that was your really big driver this quarter. I know you talked a little bit about the CRE. But just any additional color for Texas specifically? And what are the chances that you can kind of keep that type of growth rolling in that market?","Scott McLean","Absolutely, Brad. So keeping that kind of loan growth at that pace would be unrealistic and uncharacteristic with the \u2013 with how Amegy has grown historically. So I would just hit that really quickly. And it\u2019s about less than $600 million of growth during the quarter. And basically, if you look back at Amegy for the last 12 months, there was very \u2013 last 12 to 15 months, there was very little growth in Texas.","Texas was still coming out of the energy downturn in kind of the malaise, the post-Harvey malaise, which was the fall of 2017. All of that has \u2013 all of those clouds have cleared off. And so Houston, which is where about 70% of the loan growth in Texas comes from is \u2013 really is performing quite well, and Amegy is benefiting too from its many years of investment in Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio and Austin. 30% of growth is coming from those markets now and those economies are doing well.","So if you just kind of step back, C&I growth during the quarter was about $300 million, about a third of it was energy, a third of it was municipal. And then they had a couple of larger transactions really four to be precise, that could have quite frankly closed in the fourth quarter and for a collection of unrelated reasons ended up closing in the first quarter. So there\u2019s a little bit of a timing thing there.","And the CRE growth that you see in Texas, you can see all of this on Slide 22, about $170 million of growth, it\u2019s mainly coming through construction loans that were originated about a year ago. And from a historical context standpoint, the CRE portfolio in Texas is still about what it was in December of 16, almost three years ago. So, there \u2013 it looks like a lot of growth in one period, but over an extended period of time is equivalent to where that portfolio has been.","Bradley Jason Milsaps","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And just as my follow-up. Paul, the decline in DDA was pretty consistent with what you guys typically see in the first quarter. Anything in your mind that those dollars wouldn\u2019t come back in the fold as you kind of progress through 2019, given where rates are now? Just kind of curious any thoughts on the DDA as you kind of move back to the seasonally stronger quarters for you guys?","Harris Simmons","Yes, sure. The \u2013 I would say that the DDA decline was probably a little bit more than what would be expected from just seasonality. So, our ALM models would indicate that over time, we would expect to see a little less DDA and a little more interest bearing deposits.","So it\u2019s really hard for me based on this one quarter to discern a trend. I would only say that, look, versus last year and certainly over the last several years, our DDA has continued to be strong and well over 40% of our total deposits. And so, based on that experience, I\u2019m expecting continued strength there.","Bradley Jason Milsaps","Thank you.","Harris Simmons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good afternoon. I just want to\u2026","Harris Simmons","Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian","\u2026hi. I just wanted to go back to the statement during prepared remarks about Zions\u2019 earnings haven\u2019t peaked. And I just wanted to unpack that a little bit and sort of expand that beyond the 12 month\u2019s look. When you gave us guide for revenues and expenses, I think that clearly the curve outlook keeps changing. And I\u2019m wondering if your statement is supported by business growth that you\u2019re seeing or your ability to change your expense base relative to the revenue outlook?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I\u2019ll start with that and invite Harris and Scott to join in. I \u2013 as I said, we are \u2013 this is Paul. We are really focused on positive operating leverage. So to the extent, our revenues exceed expenses in terms of growth, we will absolutely continue to see improved profitability.","And so your question was, do we have the ability to sort of change our expenses relative to revenues? I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that over the last three or four years. We have absolutely, while making a massive investment in the business, have been continuing to report controlled expenses and expense growth that is lower than revenue growth. And so, our expectation that, that has been a tightly managed process here. And my expectation is, we\u2019ll be able \u2013 continue to be able to achieve that.","Harris Simmons","Yes. I\u2019d just add that. I think if we look at the economy in the markets we operate in, we\u2019re just not seeing any real signs of the slowdown. I mean, the one maybe \u2013 the exception to that would be just construction trade is really tight, that\u2019s Denver the other day and they \u2013 there\u2019s a fair amount of discussion about the impact that\u2019s having just kind of slowing things down.","I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s maybe kind of a high-class problem, because I think it\u2019s probably acting as a governor on the kind of growth that can get you the trouble, too. But it\u2019s \u2013 fundamentally, the economy is \u2013 across the Western United States is pretty strong. I also think that we have the benefit of not having probably quite as much pressure on funding loan growth that some others do.","We have a pretty good liquidity situation, and I think that gives us a little more room probably to see some loan growth without having it create too much pressure on the deposit side. So I\u2019d just add those to the mix and we\u2019re going to keep very focused on the expense side.","I do think that, I mean, the fee income piece of the puzzle looking across the industry, that\u2019s clearly proving to be a challenge across the whole regional sector. And we\u2019re no exception, but I think we nevertheless have \u2013 we probably have a little less drag that\u2019s going to come from consumer fee income, deposit fee income on the consumer side, because it\u2019s just not as big a piece of our picture. And I think that\u2019s, in my mind, one of the great challenges the industry generally has.","And so we probably \u2013 I\u2019m a little more optimistic in terms of what we can do on the fee income side than it might otherwise be. So, we add it all up and we think \u2013 and we also think that credit quality is just really good. And it\u2019s hard to \u2013 you can\u2019t stay at zero in terms of getting net charge-off for forever. But we\u2019ve been there now for about for a year and we just don\u2019t see a lot of change in that picture. So I think the provision drag is going to be pretty modest here for the next two or three quarters.","Erika Najarian","Got it. I mean, my follow-up question is on the concept of not much pressure on funding loan growth. On the other side of that, as you think about the securities reinvestment, Paul, could you give us a sense on the reinvestment strategy and also the yield that you\u2019re looking at right now in terms of reinvestment?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Well, we have been really disciplined. As we\u2019ve talked about a lot over the last couple of years and quarters, I think, we\u2019ve been really disciplined in where we are investing along the curve. We have an investment portfolio that is relatively short.","We don\u2019t have any 30-year paper in there. It\u2019s a maximum of 15-year final maturity with respect to the MBS that we hold and that\u2019s continuing. And so, the going-on yields of the portfolio in the first quarter were kind of in the 3% range. It\u2019s probably a little south of that now given sort of what\u2019s happened with respect to the curve.","But as I mentioned on the call, the fact that the cash flow within the portfolio has been really consistent here for the last several or many quarters is indicative of the, I would say, the way we\u2019re managing the duration extension risk and because the duration is relatively short and because the cash flows have been proven to be predictable, we will continue to reinvest it at the prevailing rate, which we think is an important as we\u2019re thinking about tightly managing that portfolio and being able to extract liquidity out of it, if need be, but also kind of reinvesting at the prevailing rate.","Erika Najarian","Great. Thank you.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Peter Winter","Thanks very much. Could I ask just given your prior comments about the economy and credit, you have increased the share buyback last couple of quarters. And I\u2019m just wondering given a positive outlook, would you continue to look to accelerate the buybacks?","Harris Simmons","Well, obviously, as you said, we have a little stronger loan growth that, that could actually change your thinking somewhat. But it\u2019s \u2013 as we said in our remarks, it\u2019s really a Board decision and it\u2019s one that we are going to always be very careful about getting out over our skis until we have that conversation with the Board.","So, I mean, I think we have \u2013 we said that we think that we still have some room to optimize our capital ratios. But kind of the timing and that is something we just look at every quarter. So I\u2019m not going to speculate further.","Peter Winter","Okay. And then Paul, just my question to you. You\u2019re certainly a little bit more positive on the outlook on deposit costs, just given the flattening yield curve and the Fed on hold. I\u2019m just wondering if you could be a little bit more specific what you\u2019re looking for in terms of deposit increase on the interest bearing deposits, both in the second quarter and kind of second-half of the year, I would think it would slow even more?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I appreciate your question. However, it\u2019s really hard for me to be a lot more specific than I have been. I \u2013 as I\u2019ve noted in the past, we \u2013 we\u2019ve had some modest increases in what else, I\u2019ll sort of the Board rates. But really where we are managing tightly, the deposit pricing is largely through exception pricing.","And so it\u2019s really \u2013 as we\u2019ve seen over the last kind of a year, six months to a year, where we\u2019ve really seen a lot of pressure is in the larger average balances sort of deposits. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen a lot more deposit beta, if you will, most of our deposits, particularly DDA, our operating accounts, very, very granular, very, very small sort of deposit \u2013 average deposit size.","And so it\u2019s hard to put a specific basis point expectation on it, which I think is what you\u2019re asking for. What I can really say qualitatively is that, where we\u2019ve seen pressure is in these very large deposit or balances. And fortunately, on a relative basis, we just don\u2019t have a lot of those. The vast majority of our deposit composition is from relationship-based operating accounts.","Scott McLean","I would just add to that. Peter, this is Scott, that we do have a moderately sized bucket of customer deposits that are off-balance sheet that are being swept into overnight money market funds. And we may see some growth in our own interest bearing liabilities that just comes from moving instead of paying that FHLB or broker deposits, you may see those balances come down and what we think of is wholesale deposits coming up, because to the extent we can move those client balances back on balance sheet at rates that are less than and we can less than what we\u2019re paying broker deposits or the FHLB, you\u2019ll see us do that.","Peter Winter","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harris Simmons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin James Barker","Hi. Just a follow-up for Ken on deposits. I mean where do you feel you could \u2013 do you feel comfortable with loan deposit ratio getting into the mid to high-90s if that were to occur? And what type of environment do you expect that to occur if it did?","Paul Burdiss","I\u2019ll start with that and ask Scott and Harris to join us if they feel like. I would absolutely be comfortable of a loan to deposit ratio in that high-90s. I think, loan to deposit ratio is an indication of two things, I think, liquidity and profitability. We can absolutely manage the loan to deposit ratio lower by going out and buying money.","But that\u2019s \u2013 so loan to deposit ratio, I think, again, historically has been viewed as a measure of profitability, but I think it\u2019s a little flawed, because it doesn\u2019t necessarily consider the sort of the nature of the deposit you\u2019re bringing in. And likewise as a measure of liquidity, it\u2019s also, I would argue not particularly useful, because we can manage liquidity through term funding that is not deposit-based.","So, looking at just the ratio, could I get comfortable with a loan to deposit ratio in the 90s \u2013 mid-90s. Yes, I absolutely could. The most important thing for us is managing and maintaining profitability and liquidity and we have been doing that and will continue to do that.","Kevin James Barker","Okay. And then just follow-up on expenses, core expenses were up just under 5% on a year-over-year basis. You expect that \u2013 the growth to \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s going to slow, given your guidance. Can you just give us an idea of the cadence of the year-over-year growth as we move through 2019?","Paul Burdiss","Well, as you look at seasonality of expenses, you always see an uptick in the first quarter or historically you have, because you\u2019ve got payroll taxes and you\u2019ve got stock-based compensation for retirement eligible employees and there are things like that that happen in the first quarter they don\u2019t repeat.","And so you really need to take that sort of increase in the first quarter and spread it out over the course of the year. That being said, we have a detailed budget and forecast that we believe would support the outlook, which is noninterest expense in that low single-digit range.","Kevin James Barker","Okay. Thank you.","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lana Chan of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Lana Chan","Hi, good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Lana.","Lana Chan","Paul, can you just give us any color in terms of just with the last answer in the personnel-related seasonal expenses this quarter, how much it added? How much we should come out in the second quarter?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I would encourage you to kind of look at, if you could just look at the \u2013 I think we have enough disclosure in the financials to sort of look at the trend in compensation expense and where you would \u2013 you can see that sort of bump up. I mean, it\u2019s in the range of \u2013 it\u2019s kind of between $5 million and $10 million. But I think you can probably call that out if you look at the trend in that incentive compensation \u2013 or in that compensation expense line.","Lana Chan","Okay. And then on customer-related fees, I think, you guys talked about some softness on retail and small business service charges. Is that seasonal or is that more of an ongoing factor for fees going forward? I just wanted to \u2013 $120 million of customer-related fees, I want to see if we expect any recovery in that going into the second quarter?","Scott McLean","Yes, Lana, this is Scott. That particular item retail and small business service charges has been weak for five years. It is for the industry, it has been for us. We have one year where it increased, and I think it was 2017. And then in 2018, latter half of 2018 and into 2019, we\u2019re seeing some continued softness there. So it \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t think of it as seasonal and I wouldn\u2019t think of it as an unusual trend. It\u2019s actually a trend we\u2019ve been watching for and trying to counter for sometime.","James Abbott","Yes. I think one of the things \u2013 this is James. One of the things that\u2019s consistently down is the non-sufficient funds fees. And I think as we \u2013 as the credit quality of our customers gets better and better and technology allows customers to see their balances in a real-time fashion and provides customers tools to be able to manage that type of thing. That\u2019s one of the natural fallouts of that is that we see a little less of that fee for example.","Lana Chan","Okay, thank you. It\u2019s helpful.","Harris Simmons","Thank you, Lana.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Moss with B. Riley. Your line is open.","Stephen Moss","Good afternoon. I was wondering if we could get a little further into the leads on the hedging transactions. In particular, wondering what the average term of both the rates of the swaps and the floors are and what is the rate on the floors?","Harris Simmons","Yes. These are, by and large, three-year sort of arrangements. The rate floor is about 100 basis points out of money, so they\u2019re kind of around 1.5.","Stephen Moss","Okay. And then my second question, just wondering here what was the driver of the uptick in 30-day, 90-day delinquencies quarter-over-quarter?","Paul Burdiss","Sorry, we\u2019ll have to \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was big obviously. And so I think that was probably noise in there.","Michael Morris","It was just a noise or timing. There wasn\u2019t anything material.","Paul Burdiss","But if there\u2019s something material or specific in there, we can certainly get back with that.","Stephen Moss","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hi, everybody.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","I\u2019d like to follow-up on the offsets to potentially higher deposit costs, which are underlying the stable NIM assumption. The security yields, the new ones are definitely a lever. But how much above the current loan portfolio yield are new loans coming into the book?","Paul Burdiss","Well, it gets to the loan mix, which is \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about this sometime and that\u2019s important. So it\u2019s not just a matter of new loans coming on in the rate of new loans, but the composition of the loan portfolio we\u2019ve seen better growth, for example, in commercial real estate and some construction. Those generally have better yields than, for example, residential mortgage. So it\u2019s a combination of those things in addition to the shape of the curve, which I think is kind of what you\u2019re describing.","Scott McLean","And I would just add, Steven. There \u2013 our loan officers do report there\u2019s continued pricing pressure. So come from quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year a few basis points on, at least, the major food groups, if you will. So it\u2019s \u2013 although the yield on new production is higher than the overall portfolio yield, some of the new loans that are coming on are being refinanced or refinancings of existing because of the improvement in credit quality and other factors, we are seeing some price competition. So there is a little bit of yield compression, if you will, every quarter from that factor.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I had a follow-up for Harris. You said in your opening comments that you\u2019re investing in the branch experience. I think you said more than just coffee and doughnuts. What are you planning and will we see this impact earning \u2013 expense growth? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that materially impact expense growth. But we are being very \u2013 we\u2019re very focused on trying to take the people we have in our particular branches and give them opportunities to develop additional skills and with that little bit of additional authority and we hope to over time to increase the tenure of people we have there.","It\u2019s tough to say your relationship bank work to do the kinds of things that actually create relationships, which include just having the same people there for a long period of time and having them trained and qualified to deal with particular \u2013 with smaller \u2013 kind of the small to small, mid-sized kinds of businesses that frequent branches a lot and particularly in our franchise.","And so that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re determined to do, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s not going to be something that happens overnight. But I absolutely believe that it\u2019s going to be an investment that will yield returns greater than any cost we put into it both in terms of morale and in terms of just creating the kind of sticky relationships that we hope we would have out in our branches. And I\u2019d also say, it\u2019s something that we don\u2019t think many of the larger banks are very focused on. I mean, branches have become sort of this necessary inconvenience for a lot of folks and we think about it a little differently, I think.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, great. Thanks for all the color.","Harris Simmons","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Christopher Spahr","All right. Thanks there. I\u2019d like to ask a question. Just a question on the capital authorization. When should we expect there to be a Board meeting, or is it reasonable to expect the Board meeting a week-and-a-half from today or towards the end of next week?","Harris Simmons","That\u2019s reasonable.","Harris Simmons","And then the pace of buybacks, it has picked up the last couple of quarters. Would it be reasonable to think of the pace of buyback, could it actually increase again further, or are you kind of content with the pace that you\u2019ve set for the first quarter?","Harris Simmons","We\u2019ll just \u2013 we\u2019ll be announcing something I expect by the end of next week, and I\u2019ll let it wait until then.","Christopher Spahr","Great. Thank you.","Harris Simmons","Great. Thanks.","Scott McLean","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Your line is open.","Brock Vandervliet","Thanks for taking the question Just sneak in on the line here.","Harris Simmons","Yes.","Brock Vandervliet","So just within the commercial real estate portfolio, I know you mentioned the construction and development, and I was showing some growth from draws that have been in place for a while. But the term category seem to be up pretty consistently the last four quarters. Is that indicative of your greater comfort and confidence in that segment, or better pricing or a bit of both?","Michael Morris","This is Michael Morris, I\u2019ll respond to that. The C&D growth really is for our premier clients, so most of the C&D growth that you see would not be new to bank clients. And the CRE term growth would just be a factor of either renewing or as had been mentioned earlier, moving from construction to term loans that are already on the books. And some acquisition of new loans, some new term CRE facilities here and there, but not indicative of a major trend or marketing strategy. It\u2019s business as usual and everything is well within our risk management framework in terms of concentration limits and underwriting.","Brock Vandervliet","Got it. Okay. And separately on the provision line, I see the guidance of modest provisioning and that\u2019s been consistently lower than I would have expected, given the recoveries and things. Any further color you would give in terms of the provision, the remainder of the year or the cadence of it that we should be kind of be thinking about?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I\u2019m going to start \u2013 this is Paul. Obviously, there are a lot of accounting rules, kind of most importantly that we need to think about. This is the largest estimate in our balance sheet. And so we need to build it sort of loan by loan up every quarter, which is what we do.","And so our comments are really around expectations of kind of underlying credit trends. And we have not seen \u2013 we have seen continued improvement in credit trends over the course of the last several years, maybe the pace of improvement has slowed a little. But that sort of underlying trend of continuing improvement feels like it will continue for the foreseeable future. So, the expectation is that, we\u2019ll continue to provide for a loan growth and that\u2019s really what\u2019s reflected in the outlook.","Brock Vandervliet","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Harris Simmons","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Foran of Autonomous. Your line is open.","Brian Foran","Hi, good evening.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Brian.","Paul Burdiss","Paul, I just want to clarify. I think earlier, you were talking about deposits as a key swing factor to NIM and you mentioned there was more downward pressures than upward \u2013 or downward risk than upward right now. Was that downward risk you\u2019re seeing for the NIM, there\u2019s more downward risk or just for the deposit commentary?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. That commentary was really \u2013 that sort of come out over the Q&A of the call I think that the opportunity for upside on interest rates loan securities is probably a little more limited, given sort of the shape of the curve and what we\u2019re experiencing there. So the upside is a little more limited, whereas the downside on the deposit side that is the risk of an increase in deposit rates exceeds the risk of increases in the loan yields. And that\u2019s sort of that balance is all I was trying to capture with that commentary.","Brian Foran","Got it. And then, Harris, I guess that you had made a comment that credit costs don\u2019t stay at a year forever, but they could for the next couple of quarters or near zero anyway. As someone who has seen a few cycles, I mean, what are the kind of key things you\u2019re watching right now to try to gauge \u2013 what are you looking for to kind of see the turn coming, if and when it eventually does?","Harris Simmons","It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s watching nonperforming assets trends, non-accrual, the criticized classified trends, and we had a little bit of a bump up from one deal that\u2019s going to resolve itself this past quarter. But I think fundamentally, we\u2019re just not seeing any sort of emerging storm clouds in terms of something that would cause us to think that these gross charge-offs can change very materially.","I mean, the recoveries will get \u2013 it will \u2013 I mean that obviously kind plays itself out, and you have less to pick through as you get further away from the energy event of three years ago on, et cetera. But the fundamentally, if you look at gross charge-offs, they\u2019ve been in very good shape, and I don\u2019t really see that changing at least as far out as we can really reasonably see, which is probably the next couple of quarters like that.","Brian Foran","Thank you very much.","Harris Simmons","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to James Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?","James Abbott","Thank you, everyone, for joining on the first quarter 2019 earnings call. We appreciate your time. I will be around this evening for further follow-up questions, if you have them and throughout the rest of the week, of course. And again, we appreciate your attendance today and thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott. Sir, please go ahead.","James Abbott","Thank you and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2019 third quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial performance, after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer will provide additional detail on Zions\u2019 financial condition wrapping up with our financial outlook. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer and Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer.","Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call we will be making forward-looking statements although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with this information which applies equally to statements made in this column. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com and we will be referring to these items during this call. The earnings release, related slide presentation and the earnings call contains several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. During the Q&A section of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","I will now turn time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thank you very much, James, and we welcome all of you to our call today to discuss the third quarter results. Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights. The results for the quarter were favorable in most areas compared to the year ago results. Loan growth was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our outlook for our moderate loan growth remains unchanged even though loan growth has been somewhat stronger in recent quarters. Deposit growth in the third quarter on a linked quarter basis was broad-based and stronger than we anticipated. Topic that received the most attention as we met with many of you during the quarter was the net interest margin and the cost of deposits.","Although the cost of deposits for the full quarter did not decline when compared to the prior quarter, I am happy to report that recently deposit rates have been coming down and I would therefore expect the cost of deposits to decline moderately in the fourth quarter. Credit costs remained low. We don\u2019t see any indicators of a broad-based recession on the horizon. Credit stress appears to be somewhat episodic within our loan portfolio with the only sub-sector demonstrating broad-based stress being agriculture, an industry to which we have limited exposure. We have not observed broad-based credit stress. ","Regarding capital, we are pleased to have repurchased nearly 4% of our outstanding shares in the third quarter and 12% of our shares during the last year. During the past few months, we\u2019ve been delivering an annualized common dividend yield of about 3%. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remained strong at 10.4%.","On Slide 4, we show the earnings per share results for the last several quarters. In the third quarter of 2019, we reported $1.17 of earnings per share compared to $1.04 per share in the third quarter last year. Notably, our average diluted shares outstanding have declined by 23.9 million shares or nearly 12% over the past year, accounting for most of the earnings per share improvement. Still, we feel very good about the quality of this quarter\u2019s financial performance.","Turning to Slide 5 on the left side, as you will see adjusted pre-provision net revenue or PPNR which increased 6% over the same period a year ago, on the right side of the chart showing pre-provision net revenue less current period net charge-offs on a per share basis, which increased 19% over the prior year. We believe this view of bank performance will be perhaps more comparable across banks once the new CECL accounting standard goes into effect next year.","Slide 6 shows some of the key technology objectives we have been working on. We are enhancing digital experiences for our customers with the goal of being quite competitive for the best providers of financial service products, banks and non-banks alike, while remaining focused on continuous improvement and streamlining our processes thereby keeping non-interest expense under control.","I will conclude my remarks with Slide 7 which is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. For our financial goals, we have long been committed to achieving stronger revenue growth and expense growth also referred to as positive operating leverage. In a period of falling interest rates, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage becomes more difficult. Over the long-term, we will remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage although we recognize that this challenge will increase as our operating efficiency improves. ","As lower interest rates across the yield curve have materialized over the past several months, we have sharpened our focus on non-interest expenses. Today, we are announcing an acceleration of our drive toward improving operating efficiency, which will result in a near-term workforce reduction of about 5% along with other operating expense reductions. This acceleration will result in a temporary increase in non-interest expense in the fourth quarter as severance and other similar efficiency initiative-related charges are recognized. We believe this will enable us to achieve our previously stated outlook for non-interest expense for next year, which is to hold expenses to flat to down when compared to this year. Despite the efforts to reduce costs, we\u2019ll continue to invest in enabling technologies which will help to ensure our success in an increasingly competitive marketplace.","With that overview, I will turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in additional detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris and good evening everyone. I will begin on Slide 8, which highlights two measures of profitability, return on assets and return on tangible common equity, both improved in the third quarter and our long-term goal is continued improvement in balance sheet profitability.","On Slide 9, for the third quarter of 2019, Zions\u2019 net interest income was essentially flat to the prior year period. Average earning assets increased just slightly more than 5% over that timeframe, and the yield on earning assets increased by 9 basis points. However, even though our average deposits increased to 3% over the past year, our cost of funds increased significantly due to the increase in short-term interest rates. This increase in our cost of funds more than offset the increase in the yield on earning assets.","Slide 10 breaks down net interest income by both rate and volume. You can see that our average loans grew 8% over the year ago period. Average loan growth in the third quarter was more modest up 4% annualized from the prior quarter. Over the prior-year period, the yield on loans increased 4 basis points. And relative to the prior quarter, the yield on loans declined 10 basis points. The reasons for this are the same as we provided in the last quarter: first, the recent decline in short-term rates and second, the turning of loans that is lower rates on new loans relative to maturing loans. That compression can be attributed to several factors, including competitive forces as well as a lower credit risk profile in the loan portfolio. I will discuss the benefits of a lower risk profile in just a moment when I review our capital position.","Shifting to funding, average total deposits increased 3% over the prior year period. We are reporting a relatively strong 7% annualized growth rate when compared to the prior quarter. Achieving such a strong rate of growth will likely be difficult to sustain, but we do not expect moderate deposit growth \u2013 sorry we do expect moderate deposit growth to accompany our loan growth. Our cost of total deposits increased just 1 basis point relative to the prior quarter and I expect the total cost of deposits to decline in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter due to ongoing efforts to better align deposit cost with lower market rates.","Slide 11 depicts the key net interest margin components. Our net interest margin compressed 6 basis points relative to the second quarter as loans, securities and borrowing yields and costs reacted relatively quickly to lower interest rates. It is reasonable to expect that the net interest margin will compress further during the next few quarters, reflecting the forward curve and our best estimates of loan yields, deposit costs, balance sheet growth and other factors.","Turning to loan growth, Slide 12 depicts year-over-year period-end loan growth by portfolio type with the size of the circles on this chart representing the relative size of the portfolio. For nearly all categories, we are reporting solid and consistent growth. As a minor footnote, we reclassified about $250 million of construction and land development loans into the term commercial real estate portfolio. The credit risk of the total commercial real estate portfolio is unchanged by this reclassification. As mentioned previously, we are expecting moderate loan growth and the composition of the growth should be relatively similar to prior guidance with lower risk categories growing at a stronger rate than the higher risk categories.","Interest rate sensitivity is reported on Slide 13. Zions remains moderately asset sensitive, although we have continued to reduce the magnitude of that sensitivity. Earlier in the quarter, we utilized the mark-to-market gains and previously contracted out-of-the-money interest rate floors and converted those into interest rate swaps. Earlier in the year, we were inclined to keep some optionality for scenarios where interest rates may have continued to rise. However, as the year progressed and the likelihood of rates decline became more certain, there became a greater need to hedge the emerging near-term decline in net interest income.","The partial offset to declining net interest income due to falling rates is a strengthening of certain fee income items as discussed on Slide 14. Customer-related fees were up 11% from the year ago period. This increase is primarily attributable to strength in capital markets product sales, including interest rate swaps as commercial customers lock in low interest rates on their variable rate loans. We have also seen strength in other lending activities such as residential mortgage loan originations. Although the non-interest income lift associated with these products is often driven by market conditions and can be fleeting, we are optimistic that this increased activity can continue in the -term.","As shown on Slide 15, non-interest expense declined 1% to $415 million from $420 million in the year ago quarter. Relative to the prior year, the third quarter contained a reduction in incentive compensation reflecting the more challenging interest rate-driven environment for revenue growth and reductions in FDIC insurance premiums and credit costs offset by an increase in base salaries and software amortization. As Harris noted earlier, we are accelerating our efforts to streamline operations and improve overall efficiency. While this will create elevated non-interest expense in the near-term, driven by severance and other restructuring-related costs, we believe these changes will enable an ongoing expense level which is reflective of the current environment for revenue. In fact, we now expect that total adjusted non-interest expense for 2020 will be consistent with or slightly below full year 2019 which would mean that we will have kept non-interest expense level generally flat for more than five years.","Turning to Slide 16, the efficiency ratio was 57.3% compared to the year-ago period of 58.8%. One of our long-term financial goals is to achieve an efficiency ratio that is consistent with the pure median as a first step and eventually stronger than a pure median, while simultaneously investing in digital delivery strategies such as our core modern \u2013 our modern core system, top quality treasury management software and strong web and mobile banking platforms. Additionally, we are committed to maintaining a strong risk management infrastructure that will allow us to produce consistently good credit quality results throughout the cycle. We, therefore, plan to invest meaningfully in the business, while achieving improved efficiency.","As seen on Slide 17, credit quality continues to be remarkable as the trailing 12-month net charge-off ratio is only 1 basis point. We are reporting continued improvement in non-accrual loans and loans 90 days past due. Our non-performing assets plus loans 90 days past due expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate-owned declined to below 50 basis points, a level not seen in quite some time. We had a slight uptick in classified loans, although we don\u2019t see that as the beginning of a trend. The quality of the overall portfolio is very strong and we expect only modest provision for loan losses in the near-term, learning, of course, that the upcoming CECL based allowance for credit loss estimate, which I will discuss further in a few minutes, will fundamentally change the allowance for credit loss process and estimate. We continue to maintain disciplined underwriting standard and have even tightened standard somewhat in select areas as we continue to prepare to be a positive outlier during the next economic downturn.","Over the past few years, this improvement in portfolio quality and composition has adversely impacted our loan yields but has also translated into superior credit quality results relative to peers. This change has also lead to stronger performance in our stress test results which we continue to post on our website. The resulting improvement in our risk profile has supported our reduction in the amount of common equity needed to support the company, therefore enabling the repurchase of 12% of the company\u2019s stock over the past year. Our improved risk management and credit performance have been key factors in an improvement of our debt ratings. Still, we believe we can make the case for further improvement in these external credit assessments. Slides comparing Zions\u2019 financial performance to that of A and A- rated peer banks can be seen in the appendix. During the third quarter, we ran a full parallel allowance for credit loss process, one for the incurred loss accounting standard and the other for the new current expected credit loss or CECL accounting standard.","Slide 19 reports the results of that parallel run. We have highlighted the various changes that may impact the allowance for each of the major loan portfolios with a total estimated impact on the allowance for credit losses at the bottom of the table. Our estimated day one impact and the allowance for credit losses associated with the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard currently ranges from a minus 15% to a positive 5%. We\u2019ve given ranges to reflect the reality that the economic scenarios used to create the seasonal estimate are likely to change between now and adoption in January of 2020.","Slide 20 depicts our financial outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the third quarter of 2019. With regard to loan growth, we are leaving our outlook unchanged at moderately increasing. We do see some softening on that front as compared to what we reported earlier in the year. Not mentioned in the chart but incorporated in the outlook for net interest income is a modest further reduction in the size of the securities portfolio as we refine how much liquidity is needed to support the balance sheet. In September, we reduced our outlook for net interest income to slightly decreasing from stable to slightly decreasing as the outlook for interest rates have become more negative than it was in July. We continue to believe that this is the best estimate we can provide. We are incorporating into our outlook the current shape of the yield curve.","Regarding customer related fees, we had a very strong quarter and as I said earlier, it\u2019s likely that some of the factors that contributed to the strong third quarter will remain in the near term. It\u2019s a bit more difficult to expect such strength in this activity a year from now. Meanwhile however, we expect more steady growth in other fee income categories. The combination of these two trends seems likely to result in a relatively stable customer related fees a year from now when compared to the third quarter. Building on our prior comments related to non-interest expense, we expect the overall level of adjusted non-interest expense in 2020 to be consistent with or slightly below adjusted non-interest expense in 2019. However, total non-interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2019 is expected to be elevated by severance charges of about $25 million and other restructuring related items. Also as we have previously disclosed, we are in the process of eliminating our defined benefit pension plan, which is expected to result in a onetime charge likely towards the middle of 2020. Our outlook for adjusted non-interest expense excludes these items.","Finally, I will briefly discuss our outlook for capital management. Our CET 1 ratio has declined to 10.4% from more than 12% a year ago. This measure remains about 50 basis points above the median of our peers for the second quarter. We continue to feel that remaining stronger than the peer median is important and we believe this level of capital is also somewhat conservative relative to our risk profile. Maintaining a risk profile which compares favorably to peers, while also maintaining strong positions in capital and liquidity is prudent. Therefore, while the capital we return to shareholders in 2020 is likely to be less than it was in 2019 assuming the status quo in the economy, we expect to continue to return excess capital through dividends and share repurchases over the next several quarters.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Good evening, guys.","Paul Burdiss","Hi, Ken.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","I guess Paul Burdiss first question for you, the $25 million of severance that you mentioned, is that the entire amount of the elevated expenses in the fourth quarter and also is there anything that carries over into the first quarter of 2020?","Paul Burdiss","The $25 million is an approximation of the severance charge that will occur in the fourth quarter. There are other charges related to for example branch closures that will occur in the fourth quarter, but those will likely carryover into at least the first quarter of 2020, but I have not specified the size of those items.","Ken Zerbe","Got it, okay. So first quarter could be elevated as well in addition to the seasonality of the normal comp increases?","Paul Burdiss","Right. And we will call those out as they occur.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, great. And then I guess my second question is the guidance for flat expenses in 2020, does that include the $25 million of expenses you are taking in 2019 or should we strip out the $25 million to get more of a core base number that you are going to be in line to below?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, our expense outlook is an adjusted expense outlook as you may recall. And we have a GAAP to non-GAAP reconcilement page that shows up at the back of our earnings release and at the back of our slides. And in that, you can see that items such as severance are excluded from that adjusted non-interest expense figure. So that\u2019s a long way of saying that, yes, you should exclude that.","Ken Zerbe","Perfect, alright. Thank you very much for the questions.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks a lot. Hey, Paul. I know this is a tough question for you to answer and I appreciate the sliding scale point on Zions wanting to remain above the peers and you cited the 50 basis points gap, but you cited also that you continue to believe that you are going to return excess capital, which implies that you still think you can live at a lower absolute ratio. How do we just start to get a sense of where that bottoming spot is like where you are just not going to go below, because as you have said previously you wanted to stay above it in case we get to a different part of the cycle? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Right. Thank you for the question. And just to be clear, I am not sure that you referred to capital specifically in the question, but I believe you are talking about, in particular, the CET 1 ratio. What I was trying to say as it relates to excess capital is that \u2013 and what I am trying to say by the collective comments is that we are \u2013 as we have been telegraphing for the last six quarters or so, we\u2019re getting close to the level that we think make sense for us as an organization. And so, I would not expect it to go a lot lower from where we are at. So when I refer to excess capital, I\u2019m referring to the capital that we generate through net income. We need to support the risk profile of the balance sheet, including loan growth we need to support dividends and then everything over and above that. I\u2019m trying to say is, we will be available for distribution to shareholders through share buyback.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thanks, Paul. And as a follow-up, just one question on the margin side, can you talk about just how impacted premium amortization was and whether it came from MBS and the SBA portfolio this quarter?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. On the securities portfolio yield, I have done the math on the margin it\u2019s only a couple of basis points. But on the securities portfolio yield, it\u2019s about 8 basis points quarter-over-quarter on premium amortization. A lot of that as it turns out is yes, some of it\u2019s MBS, but a lot of it is related to our SBA portfolio, which you may recall there is a couple of billion dollars and has about a 10% premium attached to it. For your information, that\u2019s not an asset class that we are continuing to add to.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thank you, Paul.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your question please.","John Pancari","Good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hi, John.","Paul Burdiss","Hey, John.","John Pancari","On the expense side, regarding the 5% headcount reduction, could you just give us a little bit more detail in terms of the timing of that \u2013 of the reductions and the overall targeted savings as a result of the reductions? And I guess, the same question will go for the branch closures as well in terms of the targeted savings that you expect and maybe the number of branches?","Scott McLean","John, it\u2019s Scott. And on the targeted savings that come from the 5% reduction in workforce, it basically \u2013 it\u2019s occurring and we should see the benefit of it throughout 2020. So that\u2019s pretty much the outlook on that. And on the branch closures, again, it\u2019s a modest amount. We are absolutely committed to our branch footprint. We\u2019re relocating some branches, but we\u2019ll bring our total level of branches down by a very modest amount. We absolutely believe that our customer base, which as you know is largely small and medium-sized businesses. Most survey data reflects that they absolutely value convenience and locations and they value access to bankers. So, it\u2019s a modest trimming of the branch footprint.","Harris Simmons","I would just add \u2013 John, this is Harris, you can pretty much take that percentage and apply it to our salary and benefits number to give you a rough approximation. We were not going to give you a precise number, but that would get you to the ballpark. And it will \u2013 you will start to see that in the first quarter pretty much in full.","Scott McLean","And that\u2019s why the magnitude of that is why we\u2019re guiding to flat to slightly decreasing on non-interest expense.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay, alright. Thanks for that. And then separately, just on the margin, I know you indicated in your prepared remarks that the NIM should see some continued pressure over the next couple of quarters or several quarters I think you said. Could you give us a little bit \u2013 to help frame that out, maybe give us some color around the expected magnitude, and then maybe just remind us of what you\u2019re assuming in terms of the Fed? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Hey, John. This is Paul. We are kind of trying to follow the forward curve, and we are deliberately non-specific with respect to the number of basis points to expect. And the reason is, as you know, the rate outlook is a little uncertain. We don\u2019t know precisely what will happen there. But more importantly, I think you know that we are as \u2013 all banks are particularly leveraged to the cost of deposits. And so, we have been working really hard to manage that down. You saw the cost of total deposits, only \u2013 it was only up 1 basis point this quarter. And as I\u2019ve said, we are expecting that to fall in the fourth quarter relative to the third. And the degree to which we are successful there will define in a large way our success in maintaining the net interest margin as we \u2013 as earning asset yields continue to fall.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thanks, Paul.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Thank you. The deposit growth was generally much better than what we expected. Are you still seeing some of that deposit growth into the fourth quarter? And is there any way you can manage that just given the NIM outlook for additional pressure?","Scott McLean","Yes, I would \u2013 this is Scott. I would just say that we don\u2019t really give sort of guidance during the quarter, but the deposit growth we\u2019re experiencing really \u2013 I know it maybe seem a little surprising to you, but if you look at the loan growth we\u2019ve had over the last four quarters, it really is very deposit-friendly type of loan growth, it\u2019s C&I owner occupied, it\u2019s commercial loans, it\u2019s municipal and it\u2019s 1-to-4 family mortgages and our HELOC portfolio. So, those are very deposit-friendly types of loan growth. And as you know, we\u2019ve had four really solid quarters now of loan growth and to see the deposits growing should happen with the portfolio like ours.","Harris Simmons","That said I wouldn\u2019t expect to see it continue as strong as we saw in the quarter. It was a little bit of a surprise.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then just to follow-up on some of your comments about a lower risk profile and tightening of the underwriting. Are you \u2013 how much are you seeing a decline in new money yields versus your current book and also on the securities book as well like given some of the tightening, underwriting and also just decreasing the risk profile?","Harris Simmons","Yes. James may have a little precision I wouldn\u2019t describe the tightening as enormous. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been dealing with quarter-by-quarter here for the last several years.","James Abbott","Yes. This is James. The amount is pretty similar to what we saw in the last three quarters, pretty much similar all year long actually, about 15 basis points or so per dollar volume during the year.","Kevin Barker","So, 15 basis points below where current new money yields are?","Paul Burdiss","That\u2019s correct, yes. The old loans are rolling off at a 15 basis point higher level than the new loans are coming on, and this is another way of saying it. Part of that\u2019s a mix shift, mortgage loans and municipal credit, how such a much lower risk profile that they have a much lower interest rate associated with them. And so it\u2019s not totally apples-to-apples. It\u2019s not same loan, same loan, but the new volume coming on is lower yield than the old loans rolling off.","Kevin Barker","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Your question please.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hi, everybody.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Steven.","Steven Alexopoulos","To start, on the 5% workforce reduction, how does that roughly split between customer-facing roles, right, items such as closing branches, and then what I would consider as a back-office, right, outsourcing staff functions overseas, stuff like that?","Scott McLean","Thank you, Steven. This is Scott. It\u2019s about roughly 30%, what I would refer to as customer-facing and the remainder would be other enterprise activities and back-office activities.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Harris, regarding the ability to deliver positive operating leverage long-term, I wasn\u2019t sure, were you signaling in your prepared comments maybe less of an ability beyond 2020?","Harris Simmons","Well, I guess, what I want to be saying is simply that in theory, you can\u2019t do it forever without fundamentally shrinking, I think. So, as the efficiency ratio gets lower, it becomes more challenging and so \u2013 at least the pace of it becomes tougher. And I think most notably in the short-term, because of the kind of the Fed\u2019s pivot on interest rates, what that\u2019s doing to margins in the industry, it\u2019s a particular headwind. But longer-term, it\u2019s something \u2013 I mean, we will absolutely continue to keep really focused on operating expenses. But at some point, you get convergence between growth rates in expenses and revenue.","Steven Alexopoulos","Got it. Okay.","Harris Simmons","Otherwise, we would all \u2013 the entire industry would be down at kind of 3% or something like that, I guess. I mean, what happens in part is that, as the industry becomes more productive, pricing changes too. So, it\u2019s up \u2013 that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to say.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.","Harris Simmons","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Jennifer Demba","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Yes.","Jennifer Demba","Question on credit quality remains really good, can you talk to us about any weakness you mentioned you saw in ag and can you also update us on credit quality in the energy portfolio?","Harris Simmons","Do you want to?","Michael Morris","This is Michael Morris speaking, Chief Credit Officer. I will defer the energy question to Scott McLean. We\u2019ve seen a little stress in a couple of other portfolios like the restaurant sector and commercial subcontractors. Nothing to really get overly concerned about here, but I think it\u2019s been well represented in the industry that those are couple of segments that are experiencing some stress in this part of the cycle.","Harris Simmons","And I think ag is \u2013 I mean, we have a couple of credits. It was up in the state of Idaho, the potato crop that\u2019s had some challenges with early freezes. And so, I think nothing that we\u2019re expected to see any significant loss, but...","Scott McLean","No, we are \u2013 that\u2019s right, Harris. We are in about the fifth year of depressed commodity prices. Tariffs, trade war talk is adversely impacted mostly hay, beef and grain, potatoes a little bit, sugar bean a little bit. Most of our clients, especially our large borrowers, have fairly deep balance sheets but have experienced some working cap stress.","Harris Simmons","And the total ag portfolio is about...","Scott McLean","It\u2019s roughly $600 million.","Harris Simmons","$600 million, yes. And Jennifer, on the energy portfolio, basically classifieds non-performers that are flat for the most part, charge-offs are still pretty benign since the last couple of quarters, and natural gas prices have been soft. They generally trade either side of $3 and have for quite some time going back 5, 6, 7 years, but we are now down below $250, but that it tends to adjust. And as you know, our borrowing bases adjust also pretty naturally with it. So, we are watching it closely, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s overly concerning to us at the moment. The declining rate count is something to watch, but interestingly as the rig count declines, so too will gas drilling, and that will allow for pricing to go up fairly quickly because most of these wells that are being driven \u2013 drilled are on three-year decline curves. So, in any event, we watch the energy portfolio very, very closely, but we think the fundamentals are in pretty good shape right now.","Paul Burdiss","I just add that gross charge-offs in the energy were $1.3 million during the quarter and we had recoveries of $1.5 million. So, when we say benign, it\u2019s pretty benign.","Harris Simmons","Which is not a word that I probably have used very much related to the energy portfolio so I probably should pick a different word.","Jennifer Demba","One follow-up if I could. What\u2019s the size of your restaurant portfolio and your commercial subcontractor bucket?","Paul Burdiss","The restaurant portfolio is roughly $750 million and the subcontractor and this would be just subcontractors, not general contractors closer to $300 million.","Jennifer Demba","Great. Thanks so much.","Harris Simmons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley. Your question please.","Steve Moss","Good evening. Paul, on your comment, you said the securities portfolio would continue to decline here. Just wondering as a percentage of assets, where you see that heading over the next 12 months or so?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I would think of it really, usually I prefer things like percentages because they are kind of broader and more directional. But in the case of the securities portfolio, we signaled last quarter that we thought it was going to decline in the third quarter. And I\u2019m just trying to signal that that may continue here into the fourth quarter. But it\u2019s in the range of kind of a couple of hundred million dollars, that\u2019s not a gigantic decline. And to your point, to the extent the balance sheet size changes, that will change that target too, because the investment portfolio really exists primarily for management of liquidity on the balance sheet.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then my second question, just on the loan pipeline, fourth quarter tends be a little stronger seasonally for you guys. Wondering how this compares with other fourth quarters.","Paul Burdiss","We don\u2019t know because it\u2019s two weeks into it.","Harris Simmons","And we are only 2 weeks into the quarter, so it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s really hard to provide any sort of accurate prediction with precision on how the quarter turns out. But we are confident in our outlook for kind of moderate growth in the loan portfolio, and we\u2019re sticking to that.","Steve Moss","Alright. Thank you very much.","Harris Simmons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Your question please.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Hi, I thought the chart on Slide 13 was extraordinarily interesting when you showed us the data on deposits on the last 50 basis points of hikes versus cumulative. And I am wondering, given some of the feedback from your peers that competition, of course, remains strong, how you see the pacing continuing especially since yield curve expectations are extraordinarily volatile right now?","Paul Burdiss","That\u2019s all true. So I would fall back though on my comments regarding overall deposit pricing, and that is that as loan yields began to decline, we saw that deposit costs continue to increase in the second quarter. That flattened out in the third quarter and as we are actively managing this. And we think we continue to have some opportunity to do that. We are expecting the overall cost of deposits to begin to fall in the fourth quarter.","Erika Najarian","So, yes, so totally heard that loud and clear. I guess, I am just wondering as we think about the piece of it because some of your peers also have given us less consistent messaging, some have said an accelerated pace in the beginning and then a leveling off and some have indicated a more accelerated pace into 2020. And I\u2019m wondering, as you think about it strategically, and again thinking about sort of volatile expectations for the short end of the curve, any thoughts on that pace \u2013 that kind of pacing?","Scott McLean","Well, overall, we have some of the best cost of deposits in the industry. And the reason for that, I would say is largely due to the fact that the composition of our portfolio is very granular. And where we look at sort of the most intense deposit pricing competition, it\u2019s typically on sort of a larger, I would say sort of lumpier deposits and because so many of our deposits are operating in nature, we have been able to benefit from a lower relative beta on the way up. And what that means though is that on the way down, my expectation is just as rates have been moving up rather slowly on the way up, it\u2019s going to take a lot of work to move them back on the way down. So, if you are asking about sort of an accelerating beta in the near-term I don\u2019t foresee that.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And if I could squeeze my second question, sorry \u2013 have to ask a two-part first question. But as I take a step back, I feel like Harris, every single quarter, you are asked about the capital ratios and the conservatism with which you manage your balance sheet exposure, capital and your liquidity. And I guess the message really here is that, clearly \u2013 look a 10% CET 1 floor seems robust for your risk profile, but given the uncertainties, you would rather be using your balance sheet to win business in a downturn rather than draw it down right now. And so we should stop asking you that question, I am just trying to think about is the message from capital is really that this is the right for now?","Harris Simmons","What a good idea, I guess, I think somewhere around here is about where we are going to want to be given the fact that there is a fair amount of uncertainty in the world. And I think we have said we want to be sure that we don\u2019t want to have an enormous amount of excess capital just sitting here fallow. But I do want to be sure that we\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet going into whatever the next down cycle looks like. And I think we are pretty well positioned for that and we are probably \u2013 we are just not going to see the kinds of levels of buybacks that we have had been able to accomplish over the last year. But particularly if we don\u2019t see reasonably strong loan growth, I think there is still going to be some room to continue down that path, but it just won\u2019t be at the same pace.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Harris Simmons","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Your question please.","Gary Tenner","Thanks everybody. My questions were actually asked and answered. Appreciate it.","Harris Simmons","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open.","David Long","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","Harris Simmons","Hey, David.","David Long","Question regarding mortgage banking, something that you guys have talked a little bit about lately in some investor meetings. And just want to get an idea as to what your appetite is to grow that part of the business to leverage your footprint, and also how big then can that become for the bank? Thank you.","Scott McLean","Thank you for the question. This is Scott McLean. Our mortgage business is really important to us. It will generate \u2013 will fund about $2.5 billion this year. That will be up from about $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion. We\u2019ve been at these levels and higher. It is a perfect product for community bank model like us. And also a very high percentage of our mortgage clients are small business owners, which also fits really nicely in many cases their mortgage is larger than the business loans they ask us for. And so, it\u2019s a business too that we\u2019ve just rolled out some really exciting customer-facing digital technologies. We\u2019ll take about 10,000 applications a year. And at this point last year, we were 100% paper. At this point as of right now, we are at 75% coming through our digital channel. That is a huge change in a short period of time going from paper to digital and it\u2019s allowing us to get more into their conforming mortgage business. Historically, we have principally been a jumbo lender average loan size about $600,000 and this new digital interface should allow us to start originating conforming mortgages much more actively than we have in the past. It\u2019s going to be a great product for our 430 branches. And that kind of mortgage lending also has fees associated with it, because we sell all those conforming mortgages, mortgages generally less than $430,000, $450,000. And so the fee income outlook associated with that volume is positive.","David Long","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jon Arfstrom","Good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hey, Jon.","Jon Arfstrom","Hey, question on the back-end loan growth. On your guidance slide, you talked about moderately increasing, and it may not be as strong as the prior 12 months, but then you also are talking about moderate to strong in C&I and owner-occupied and other areas. Just curious, bigger picture, are you any more or less optimistic on the growth outlook and any change in optimism from your typical SME borrower?","Paul Burdiss","Well, let me talk about the outlook specifically. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t clear the way we laid it out. What we were trying to say was that if you look back over the last 12 months, we had sort of a moderately increasing outlook, but what we achieved was actually better than that. And we are just trying to say, hey, that was a little better than moderately increasing and that\u2019s not what we are expecting. We are expecting moderately increasing, right. That was kind of the concept that we were trying to accomplish. But as it relates to overall sort of a composition of the growth and what we\u2019ve seen and the mix of growth with the exception that I just laid out, I think we feel pretty good about that category growth over the next 12 months, which is what we are trying to convey.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay. And any change in the optimism of your clients?","James Abbott","Maybe ever so slightly, Jon. This is James.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay.","James Abbott","Very ever so slight among a very maybe handful of relationship managers would tell you that maybe some of their customers have experienced a little bit less optimism these days. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s broad based.","Harris Simmons","And I would say it\u2019s kind of anecdotal and by definition really hard to measure.","Jon Arfstrom","Yes, okay. And then the other thing I just wanted to clarify on the fee income lines, you talk about stable from a very strong 3Q. Would you consider 3Q elevated? I realize it\u2019s clearly an offset to the margin and they seem to move in different directions, but would you consider that elevated, and if so, maybe sustainable in the near-term?","Scott McLean","Jon, it\u2019s Scott.","Jon Arfstrom","Hi, Scott.","Scott McLean","Yes, I think it was a little elevated. But with fee income, it seems like every quarter is a little muted or a little elevated. And so, we are still maintaining our guidance around mid single-digit fee income growth is what we sort of said year-over-year. And we saw really good strength in this quarter in a number of our capital markets businesses, and \u2013 but we\u2019re coming off a low base. And so, I\u2019m optimistic about those products going forward and we have some other products that are going to be, I think positive for us next year also that could take the place of anything that we lose.","Harris Simmons","Yes, it\u2019s just \u2013 I think it\u2019s kind of \u2013 there is a silver lining to what we see in the yield curve, that\u2019s been in mortgage and then some capital markets activity \u2013 swaps in particular. And if we started to see some slope in the yield curve, it\u2019d probably hurt those and help us in some other places, so.","Jon Arfstrom","Okay, thanks. Nice job, guys.","Harris Simmons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to James Abbott for any closing remarks.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","James Richard Abbott - Senior Vice President, Director of Investor Relations","Thank you, Esther, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2016 second quarter earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.","I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.","A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com, and we will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation, and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts.","Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used predominantly throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published document, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.","We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer section. We ask each of you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question, in order to enable other participants to ask questions also.","I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, James, and we welcome all of you to our call this afternoon to discuss our 2016 second quarter results. On slide three are some highlights for the quarter. Earnings per share increased to $0.44, a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. By using the same adjustments that we used to compute our efficiency ratio, which primarily adjusts for the loss on the sale of our remaining collateralized debt obligation portfolio a year ago and the preferred stock redemption expense in the second quarter of this year, earnings per share increased nearly 17% over the prior year second quarter.","We're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is the result of solid net interest income growth and adjusted non-interest expense levels that were well-controlled and that remained within the parameters of our stated expense initiative.","Adjusted for the same items mentioned earlier, we achieved positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter. We're tracking well with our efficiency initiative, with the efficiency ratio declining to 64.5% in the second quarter from 68.5% in the prior quarter. Recall that our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%.","We also experienced improved loan growth. The second quarter loans increased 2.6% from prior quarter, so it was a good quarter for loan growth.","Credit quality is a little bit of a tale of two cities. We consistently tried to be very transparent about the credit quality challenges of the oil and gas portfolios through this energy cycle. It remains challenged, and we'll discuss that in a little more detail later.","Outside of oil and gas, the loan net charge-offs were only $1 million on a portfolio of approximately $40 billion of non-oil and gas loans. So when you get outside of the oil and gas portfolio, we're actually really, really pleased with quality that we're seeing there.","Turning to slide four, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue was improved by a strong 32% over the past year. The adjustments to the GAAP numbers are detailed at the end of the slide deck, but the major exclusion is the effect of securities gains and losses.","We have been successful in improving both revenue and trimming expenses. We expect to continue to post continued growth in adjusted pre-provision net revenue, although we expect the rate of growth for the next 12 months to be somewhat less than the very strong 32% we saw this quarter.","On slide five, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the first quarter, we experienced an acceleration of loan growth in the second quarter with loans held for investment increasing 2.6% as previously noted. Deposit balances increased an annualized 3.1% from the prior quarter without an increase in the cost of deposits. On slide six, there's a graphical representation of our loan growth by type. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan types.","We remain pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth. Although, we've experienced strong growth in term commercial real estate, we expect growth in that category to moderate going forward. We also expect non-energy commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans to experience solid growth and to be the primary drivers of loan growth over the next few quarters. We continue to expect a decline in the National Real Estate portfolio that we've discussed on prior occasions.","I might add one additional note regarding overall loan growth going forward. The second and fourth quarters are typically seasonally a little stronger than the first and third quarters, so while we are particularly pleased with the second quarter's growth, we expect more tempered growth in the third quarter.","Moving to slide seven, we are well on our way to achieving another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which is to reduce the efficiency ratio to less than 66% for the full year of 2016. As noted, year-to-date efficiency ratio was 66.5%, quarterly level was 64.5%. I'd also note that we are achieving all of this while investing substantially in enabling new technology and modernizing our core deposit and loan systems, which we expect will provide benefits for years to come and will be a really important competitive strength for us once we complete these projects over the next two years or three years.","On slide eight is our scorecard highlighting the commitments we made to shareholders back in June of 2015. I'm pleased with the progress made in a number of these areas in a relatively short period of time. All of the major initiatives are tracking to the targeted budgets and timelines. I'm pleased to report that we've completed the preferred equity dividend reduction a year earlier than our commitment.","My concluding comment will be regarding credit quality. In previous presentations to investors, I've highlighted that Zions' loan quality, as measured by net loan losses, has been superior to most regional peer banks through multiple cycles. This is largely attributable to the collateralized nature of our lending. On slide nine, my high-level comment on energy lending is that we have turned from cautious to cautiously optimistic. We believe there will continue to be losses in that portfolio, but with our strong reserve at present, we expect to experience average quarterly provisioning for loan losses over the next year at a level that is relatively consistent with that of the second quarter. Excluding energy loans, credit quality is really strong across the company, as noted, and this is true by both loan type and geography. About $40 billion of the $42.5 billion loan portfolio consists of non-energy loans and the total net charge-off ratio on that portfolio during the last five quarters has a median of only one basis point annualized.","Non-performing assets were stable relative to the prior quarter, and non-energy classified loans declined. And 90-plus day delinquencies also declined. So, some good metrics there.","With that overview, I will turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide 10. For the second quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $91 million, or $0.44 per share. Relative to the second quarter of last year, net interest income increased about $41 million or 9.7%.","Customer-related fees, which is the bulk of non-interest income, improved about 5% from the second quarter of 2015. At $382 million, non-interest expense was lower in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the year-ago quarter, although the year-ago quarter included seasonal stock-based compensation which was incurred in the first quarter in 2016, for this fiscal year. However, even considering this, we continue to make solid progress on our non-interest expense commitment.","Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, at our last earnings call, we provided an outlook for provisions for the next four quarters that were consistent with the first quarter of 2016. Overall, loan losses in the second quarter were roughly in line with that forecast.","Also in the second quarter, we observed higher and more stable energy commodity prices, improved sentiment by oil and gas borrowers and sponsors, and improved capital markets activity in that industry.","However, because we remained cautious on the outlook for losses in that portfolio, we maintained the dollar amount of the oil and gas reserve. The resulting reserve, as a percentage of oil and gas loans, increased slightly as a result of the decline in oil and gas balances outstanding.","Additionally, continued improvements in the rest of the loan portfolio and minimal non-oil and gas net charge-off have resulted in lower overall reserve and provision levels in the second quarter when compared to the first quarter.","Slide 11 outlines our recent trends in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate strength in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 9.7% when compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by growth in loans and in the investment portfolio. The linked quarter increase was due to various factors. Most of the increase was due to a strong average loan growth and continued deployment of cash into higher yielding, highly liquid investment securities.","We remain positioned to benefit from rising rates, particularly short-term rates, as shown in the box at the bottom right hand side of the slide. Although we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into securities and loans, the interest rate risk characteristics of those assets, combined with continued deposit growth, have resulted in a somewhat stable interest rate sensitivity position. Using the midpoint of the range shown, a 25-basis point rate increase would improve annual net interest income by $25 million to $30 million, we expect.","As a reminder, our performance objectives that were initially communicated in June 2015 assume one additional 25-basis point federal funds target rate increase in December of 2016. Recently, the market was pricing in about a 50% chance of this occurring, approximately back to where it was prior to, and up substantially from the low of 8% in the wake of the Brexit vote.","Slide 12 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We continue to add high quality liquid securities to our investment portfolio in the second quarter, reflecting the need for a permanent, high quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively, and in light of the liquidity coverage ratio rule.","Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in current and downside economic environments, when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the second quarter, the available-for-sale investment portfolio increased $879 million, on average, when compared to the prior quarter.","We continue to exercise caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity, as we purchase fixed-rate investments, and with respect to the duration extension risk inherent in that investment portfolio. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, right around three years, with duration extension risk being only about a half a year, if rates increased by 200 basis points.","The duration of the entire securities portfolio, including our floating rate SBA securities, is about 2.7 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models estimate that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to 2.8 years.","A minor footnote to the disclosure on this extension risk. In previous iterations, we assumed a static prepayment rate for the SBA securities. In April, we made a change to the model to assume dynamic prepayment speed assumptions, and these securities behave in the opposite fashion when compared to residential mortgage-backed securities. We believe the SBA securities are expected to generally experience higher prepayment as rates rise, thus in some sense, offsetting the minor extension risk continued within the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio.","Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yields of the investment portfolio, and the loan production, can be found on slide 13. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. Top line, the loan yield, which expanded two basis points from the prior quarter, to average 4.16% and this was primarily attributable to commercial real estate loans that matured or re-priced during the quarter.","The securities portfolio yield dipped this quarter, largely due to increased premium amortization which was in turn due to higher prepayment rate. We expect some additional pressure on the securities portfolio yield in third and fourth quarters of 2016 as a result of the recent increase in mortgage refinancing activity. At the bottom of this chart is a line depicting our cost of funds as a percent of our earning assets which continues to be quite low, at 16 basis points and was stable relative to the prior quarter. The combination of all of these components and the continued deployment of cash into better yielding, highly liquid investment, resulted in a four-basis point increase in the net interest margin this quarter.","Although we do expect increased premium amortization from the residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio as well as increased refinance activity on a portion of our residential loan portfolio, we estimate the effect on the net interest margin to be less than five basis points in the near-term. This may be offset by continued shift of cash into loans and securities. Over the longer-term, as cash balances reach minimal levels, we expect to require additional funding for loan growth. Although, most sources of funding would result in lower incremental margins per dollar of loans produced, the overall effect could be a modestly compressing net interest margin, but a continued increase in net interest income.","Turning to slide 14 and non-interest income, because of the seasonality of results, we think year-over-year comparison is most relevant. We were able to increase customer-related fee income by 5% over the year-ago period. The areas experiencing the most significant growth include treasury management, which was up 8%, wealth management, which was up 9%, and mortgage, up 16%.","Notably, in the current quarter, there was a $1.7 million gain in the loan sales and servicing line item that is related to the increased valuation of mortgage loan, held for sale at quarter-end. That valuation increase was attributable to the sharp decline of interest rates at the end of the month of June. As such, we do not expect that specific gain to be repeated, although we continue to expect relatively strong growth in our mortgage business.","Non-interest expense on slide 15 declined 4.3% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table in the back of our slide deck, the decline was 2.6% from the year-ago period. Although, I will note that about half of that improvement is due to the timing of stock-based compensation which we have discussed previously.","For 2016, we are tracking to an adjusted non-interest expense level that is consistent with our stated goal of less than $1.58 billion. Relative to the prior quarter, the decline in non-interest expense was predominantly due to a decline in salary and benefits. As you know, in the first quarter, we incur seasonal expenses which taper or are not present for the balance of the year. Specifically, severance declined $3 million; stock-based compensation and retirement plan matching declined $9 million, and payroll taxes declined $4 million when we observed the second quarter compared to the first quarter.","Turning to slide 16, we're pleased to announce last Friday that we are actively pursuing our capital plan. To that end, the board has increased the quarterly dividend rate by 33% to $0.08 per share. Additionally, we have been authorized to initiate our common equity buyback plan, which calls for $180 million over the course of the next four quarters. By doing so, we will be actively managing our capital to our lower level in order to align the capital structure to the risk profile of the company. We expect this to enhance return on equity as well as accelerate the growth rate of earnings per share.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott McLean to discuss energy lending and recap our commitment to investors. Scott?","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Paul. On slide 17, we show on the left side of the slide the oil and gas loans broken down by upstream services and other. Other is essentially midstream and downstream. Energy loan outstanding balances decreased about $73 million from the prior quarter with declines principally in upstream and the services portfolio, offset by a small amount of growth in the midstream portfolio.","Parenthetically, you will note on slide 22 that energy loan commitments declined more than $270 million from the prior quarter and are down $875 million from the prior year. Looking at the problem loan metrics, again on slide 17, for the oil and gas portfolio, classified energy loan balances increased about $99 million during the quarter. This compares to a $194 million increase in quarter one, which indicates a slowing trend in new problem outstandings. Also of note and easier to see on slide 22, criticized balances actually declined $20 million from Q1.","Finally, non-accrual loan balances were flat relative to the prior quarter. It may be helpful to understand that the vast majority of criticized, classified and even non-accrual loans are still current on their contractual payment.","On slide 18, regarding our loss expectations, if oil were to hold in the mid-$40s or higher, we currently expect energy losses for 2016 to be approximately $125 million. We expect most of these losses to come from our services portfolio, an area where a substantial number of borrowers remain challenged. Although, oil and gas net loan losses may remain elevated, we anticipate the second half of 2016 to be less than the first half of 2016 in terms of energy net charge-offs, which were approximately $73 million in the first half of 2016. Most of the balance of the loans that we flagged as high risk for loss, already have substantial specific reserves set aside against them. As Harris noted earlier, we have approved (21:55) our outlook on energy to what we would describe as cautiously optimistic. Our conversations with borrowers and sponsors suggest that sentiment has improved, as you can imagine, given the increase in the underlying oil and gas commodity prices.","Also highlighted on this slide, we maintained our energy loan loss reserve relatively flat, equaling slightly more than $200 million and more than 8% of outstanding balances. We consider this a very strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations.","If you turn to slide 19, this is a list of our key objectives and our fundamental commitments to shareholders. We're fully committed to achieving the positive operating leverage we described, and I think at this point, with more than 30% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a very noticeable difference. We remain committed to the substantial simplification of all operational processes and upgrading our technology systems, which will position us with perhaps the most modern loan, deposit and customer information infrastructure in the United States. When complete, this investment will significantly simplify our back office, provide data on a real-time basis to bankers and customers, improve our new product time to market, position us well to more aggressively adopt enhanced digital capabilities and many additional advantages.","Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we're targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what can be seen today. And we are tracking well with those goals as discussed earlier.","Regarding returns of capital, we're pleased with the non-objection by the Federal Reserve to increase our return of capital to shareholders.","Finally, we're absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach. Perhaps the best acknowledgment that our commitment to doing business locally really is the strategic differentiator is the superlative results we received again this year in the nationwide survey conducted by Greenwich Research. As you know, we've received more awards for the highest level of national distinction than any other bank, and we are only one of four banks that have performed at industry-leading level since the initiation of this survey approximately eight years ago.","Paul, with that, I'd like to turn the call back to you.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Scott. Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are downgrading our loan growth outlook to moderately increasing from increasing, due primarily to internal decisions to constrain some of the commercial real estate growth we have recently experienced, although the quality of what we're producing remains very strong.","We're going to remain disciplined in our concentration risk management avoiding too much in any one geography, loan type, or single vintage. We expect net interest income to increase in the mid-single-digit to high single-digit growth rate driven primarily by loan growth and additional growth in the investment portfolio.","Given the right market conditions, we may also add interest rate swaps to assist with the reduction of our asset sensitivity. Although, our efficiency target includes the assumption of one additional quarter-point rate hike, we believe we can achieve a mid-single-digit to high single-digit growth rate in net interest income without an increase in the target federal funds rate.","We expect a quarterly provision for credit loss which includes the provision for both funded loans and unfunded loan commitments to be roughly stable relative to the second quarter assuming no significant adverse change in market conditions.","We expect the customer-related non-interest income, which excludes dividend income and securities gains and losses, will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this area.","We continue to be encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allow Zions to remain on track toward our goal of adjusted non-interest expense at less than $1.58 billion for 2016.","For the next four quarters, we expect non-interest expense to run approximately similar to the first half of 2016 annualized, with similar seasonal variation in the first quarter of 2017 as was seen in the first quarter of 2016.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter returned to its more typical level. Recall in the first quarter we recognized some one-time tax credit. We expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36% over the next 12 months. We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline. With the successful tender completed in the second quarter, preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $45 million over the next 12 months.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Esther, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Could you give a bit more detail about the growth in commercial real estate that you saw this quarter? Are there particular geographies that have been driving that? Are there particular types of loan, and it looks like the yield stepped up a bit, so where would be opportunities to add yield? Thank you.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead.","Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Michael Morris. I'm the Chief Credit Officer. I'll comment on that briefly. The term commercial real estate growth that we saw in Q2 was driven partly by slower paydowns, some conversion of construction to term loan and other value-add transactions in the income property space, all of which are well underwritten, safe DCRs, well-defined and lower LTBs (28:24), equity and transaction. So it was a little bit unusual, but we're very satisfied with the credit quality of that particular portion of the loan growth in CRE.","James Richard Abbott - Senior Vice President, Director of Investor Relations","And, Geoff, this is James Abbott. I just might add a couple, we looked at the underwriting statistics of the production for the quarter, and just kind of as a general comment, the average loan-to-value was in the mid-50%s, and the average debt service coverage ratio would be around two times coverage, so very good underwriting statistics on the growth that we did see, but again, as we mentioned earlier, we're concerned about too much in one vintage (29:05) or one particular loan classification.","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Geoff, this is Scott. I would also note that geographically, there was really nice dispersion across California, Arizona, and Nevada and Washington, with a small, modest amount of growth in Texas on the term side, but the term has been pretty well-balanced across the portfolio.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And the step-up in yield on CRE?","Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I'll comment briefly on that as well. The capital markets have backed up a little bit in CMBS. Borrowers are finding it a little tougher to place CRE terms, so in response, the line bankers and the business units facilitating CRE have upped the pricing of the overall coupon.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you very much.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Joe.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Joe.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I thought it was a pretty solid performance on the fee side. Is it still early yet, or are you starting to see some results from some of your initiatives there? And, excluding the loan sale valuation thing you talked about, is this a pretty good base to build off, going forward here?","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Joe, this is Scott, and, yes, I think our initiatives are showing nice progress. Our treasury management activities are still \u2013 it's our largest fee income stream. It's about 30%, and it's growing in the mid-single-digit to high single-digit rates, which is really good for that business.","Our other bank card products, business card, consumer card, are growing at high single-digit rates, which is \u2013 we've talked about repeatedly over the last couple of years, basically trying to get the same sort of penetration in our other markets that we currently achieve for those products in Zions First National Bank, our bank in Utah.","And then wealth management, which we've been concentrating on, it's growing high single digits. Mortgage, the fee income component is not growing, even though our origination volume is up, it was up 30% last year. Our origination volume will be up about 30% this year, but we are keeping more of that on the books, and consequently, it's not having the fee income benefit that we thought it would. But those would be just some things I would highlight.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And I guess, as a follow-up along those lines, I saw you purchased $104 million of loans or so in the quarter. I was curious what drove that decision, and do you see doing more of that going forward?","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","It was a modest purchase with a really strong correspondent that we have a lot of respect for. We are, as you know, still significantly underweighted on exposure to 1-4 Family, and even though we're originating really nice volumes with our mortgage initiative, we thought at least having this as an alternate source is a good thing. The yields are significantly higher than what we could buy into our investment portfolio, and the credit statistics are on par with our own originations, with yields principally on par with our own originations. So it's just a real nice relationship, and we'll probably continue it at a very modest pace. But it's clearly not a key driver of our results.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, no, I understand. Okay. Thanks so much, Scott.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Eads with UBS. Your line is now open.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hello.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Just kind of curious, obviously you've had good deposit growth, kind of kept the cash balance pretty high. At this point, how much further do you expect the cash balance to come down?","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry?","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How much further do you expect the cash balance to come down?","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, right. So, we're going to continue to work that down as we invest. Obviously, deposit ebbs and flows are going to impact that. It's hard for me to give you a precise number, although I will say that, despite the very good loan growth we've had in the first half of the year, we continue to be on track with respect to our investment portfolio target, which is purchasing another, sort of, $1.5 billion or so over the next two quarters.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Right. With respect to, if you keep having the deposit growth, would you expect to increase that? Or would you be kind of happy where that, you know, just getting to that point?","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If the question is about the cash balance, I would expect to continue to whittle that down. Ultimately, as I said in my prepared remarks, I do expect for us to get into a position where we are going to incrementally go out and need to fund loan growth. When that happens, then you can assume that our cash balance has reached sort of its low point, and the point that we're most comfortable with.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Then just a quick one on the mortgage book, or particularly in the (34:51), it looks like you kind of have broad-based growth in all the geographies. I'm curious, you know, is that just kind of a function of growing off of a low base? Or is there something you guys are, you know, doing to generate that loan growth in a \u2013 where most of the peers are struggling, to generate that loan growth there?","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Now, that's been kind of the focus of the very specific campaign to, that's been focused on home equity lines of credit. So I think you're seeing results of that kind of marketing push.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. On the expense side, you guys are doing a great job and certainly marching towards that sub-$1.58 billion this year, and I was just wondering, you gave that plus-$1.58 billion number for next year a long while ago and you've tracked so much better already. Just wondering what kind of line of sight you have on that at this point and if you think you can maybe have more flexibility than you had originally thought on any increases that would have come after this year?","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Right. This is Scott. And basically what we said was $1.58 billion for this year, slightly increasing in 2017, and I think fundamentally we feel we're going to be able to stay fairly close to the $1.58 billion next year as well. So we're continuing to find new ways to reduce expense in light of \u2013 and fund those areas that are growing.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yes. And has...","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I expect we'll have a little more to say about it as we get closer toward the end of the year, so I would agree with what Scott just said. I mean I \u2013 to the extent that it's north of $1.58 billion, it won't be much in excess of that, maybe better than it, but I think it's a little early still.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Okay. Well, I'll ask my follow-up just related to it, which is if you were to do better than it, do you think it's because you're finding more or is it because the cresting of some of the prior spend is just coming in better than expected?","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","I think it would principally be because we're finding more opportunities to simplify how we do business, and those opportunities we're digging into literally every day, we have been. The adoption of common practices in back office activities and middle office activities is just continuing to show us opportunities to reduce cost. So it'll be more related to that than any kind of cresting of previous activities.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Marty.","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Hey.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Wanted to ask you, as you think back over the last year in your incremental purchase of $5 billion, how much do you think you've increased the benefit from that versus doing it today? So since you had higher rates over the last year, if you're looking at 10 basis points for every $5 billion, it would be $5 million that you'd be able to generate annually. So how much do you think now you're buying compared to what you were buying yield about a year ago?","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Are you asking about the incremental yield of bonds we're putting on?","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","The difference between what you bought over the last year and what you're buying today.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. There are a couple of things there; one is rate and one is volume. And I think you can probably look at MBS rates in the marketplace or kind of the 5-year treasury and kind of come up with an estimate of that differential in yield, between what we're buying then and what we're buying now.","The other thing I would point out, though, and I'm sure you've noticed, is that we bought a lot of bonds in the second half of last year. We did okay in the first quarter; in the second quarter, we really slowed that down. We slowed it down because of the shape of the curve, and I think we've been pretty clear about telegraphing our intentions.","While we need to continue to put money to work, we are going to try to be thoughtful around the timing of those purchases. And I think your question kind of points specifically to any incremental value we may have created there. So I can't give you kind of a specific dollar amount, Marty, but I think it's probably pretty easy to triangulate on, when you look at the change in the market and the volume of what we bought over the course of the last year.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Yes. When I triangulate it, I get $20 million to $25 million annual earnings that you actually generated by starting about a year ago. So the other thing I was wondering is it looks like you're starting to use a little bit of municipals. Is that something you're adding more of? Or are you finding some opportunities there? It'd be kind of an interesting little twist on what you've been doing in the securities portfolio and kind of alleviates some of the pressure on yields that you would be getting right now.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have a very long and successful history in dealing with municipalities and providing credit to the local markets. This is critically important to what we do as a very locally-oriented bank. I think we're successful across our footprint, have been for a very long time, decades, and continue to be. So I think that what you're seeing there, Marty, is just a continuation of the success that we've had as an organization.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would add that it is something that we are very focused on trying to step up somewhat, and do more of this particularly with smaller municipalities, where we think the risk\/reward kind of trade-off is quite nice. And whereas Paul indicates, we have a very long, solid track record. So yes, there's some focus there. The growth you're seeing isn't primarily a result of that push yet, but I'm hoping that over the next couple of years, you'll start to see more of them.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And then, Harris, one last question. When you look at the excess capital, we estimate it to be about $1 billion. Now that we're going into the next phase, which is being able to pull some of that capital and give it back to shareholders, if you had a free rein, let's say we went back to the days where you could pretty much look at your excess capital and do something with it, it would add 150 basis points to your returns if you could deal with that $1 billion. What would you do if you didn't have the constraints that you have today? I mean how would you strategically deal with that at this point?","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the first thing I'd say is clearly this, the world has changed a lot from the days when you had free rein. But you're posing a hypothetical. I guess I would say, clearly, we would use everything we've done in building capabilities to stress test in a model to think about risk particularly in a downturn, to inform how we think about capital, and there are a lot of things that we have built risk management-wise here in the last five years or six years or seven years that I think are actually really useful tools. Yes. I think we would agree that we got more capital and we're at the north end of where our peers are.","I would note that we'll always want to be probably kind of to the strong side so long as we have somewhat higher exposures to both commercial real estate and energy. We know that those are both segments where you can see maybe a little more cyclicality than some other things. And so this \u2013 if you took all of the limits off, this wouldn't be a race to the bottom, if you will, in terms of draining the capital. But we want to kind of thoughtfully try to right size our capital and to grow into it, and I think we've got \u2013 it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of what we can do.","I don't know, I hope that's helpful. We know that we have more preferred than we probably need right now. That's something we've talked about and that we continue to opportunistically deal with, but on the common equity too, we're heavy and that's something that increasingly I think you'll see us working at. It's very much on our minds.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR & Company [Capital Markets]. Your line is now open.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes. I'm following a question on capital. I mean, you've done a great job over the last 12 months, 18 months getting your expenses down, getting the preferred down and whatnot, but your ROEs \u2013 and you do have more capital, I think, than you need, but your ROEs tend to still be stuck in that middle single-digit, and some of that I think is the credit costs associated with the oil and gas.","But what is your ultimate goal? What is your ultimate goal relatively speaking with your ROEs, to get it into the \u2013 how are you going to get it into the 10% to 12% range?","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think, and I'd say that our goal is, over the next couple of years, to get it up into up around 10%, and we think that that's doable. There is some additional reduction in preferred that will help. I mean, obviously the cost of preferred is a drag on the ROE. I would expect that as we continue to see better results through CCAR, that we'll be able to be a little more aggressive in our capital repatriation ask.","And then there's still a lot of operating leverage. I think it's really important to focus on what we're accomplishing. If you look at pre-provision net revenue as operating leverage that you see playing out over the last few quarters, it takes not a whole lot of additional work in that area to start to make a real difference.","And then finally, I would say that as we get through the energy cycle, we've got a very strong reserve. We do think that, that \u2013 I expect we're going to be able to start to lessen the provision, as we said earlier. As we come out the other end, and I think short of real deterioration, significant deterioration of the rest of the economy, the other credit metrics around here are very strong. Our absolute reserves are strong.","And I think one of the competitive advantages we're going to have that will feed into ROEs is going to be a provision, when we get through the energy cycle, that is likely to be pretty low, and it'll also help with ROE, while we continue to build this operating leverage that I'm talking about.","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Paul, I'd just add that...","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And one quick \u2013 okay. Go ahead.","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","I'd just add to that, that the reason we focus so much attention and communication about the positive operating leverage is that we really do believe that the basic assumptions about loan growth, redeploying cash, fee income growth, holding expenses flat, the resulting positive operating leverage that we model moves us a long way over a three-year period to a much more representative ROE. And then, depending on what assumptions you want to make about our ability to reduce capital or trim capital, we believe we can get back to the levels Harris described, with the plan that we have in place.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd also just note too that we've clearly been trying to \u2013 taking some asset sensitivity off the table, but there's still a fair amount there. And in this rate environment, I personally find myself asking, scratching my head and saying there's this 775-basis point premium to a risk-free rate. Should it continue to go north of that, beyond, to 12% or something like that, I think we ought to all worry about an industry where the expectations \u2013 in an industry where you've sort of doubled the common equity in it over the last decade, a 12% ROE is what used to be a 24% ROE. And I think that could involve stretching beyond the point that is actually prudent. So it's how I think about it.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Then the second question, then with a follow-up question is, on the loan that you purchased on the residential side, were they mostly jumbos or were they just conforming-type loans?","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","They're jumbos.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Jumbos. Hey, guys, thank you very much.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yep.","James Richard Abbott - Senior Vice President, Director of Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey. Good evening.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Brad.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I guess I'll ask maybe the first energy question, but just curious, Scott. I appreciate your comments on \u2013 it sounds like people became more positive, whether it be your borrowers or investors. We had a nice move in oil during the quarter, up close to $50. We've since come back I guess into the low $40s. What level in your mind, I guess, did you start to get concerned again, or do you think it starts to maybe lock \u2013 maybe create more gridlock or call into question maybe some of the deals that have been put in place thus far? Just kind of curious, any color around the more recent move, and I know it's been a short period of time, but just kind of curious what your thoughts would be there?","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Brad. Happy to respond to that. The other thing that I would note, we don't comment about it enough, but natural gas prices also have rallied significantly since early March. Recall that they declined quite a bit in the fourth quarter of last year and through the middle of March. Oil prices really declined kind of January-February and the first part of March, and then both have really made a very nice recovery since then. I only note that because, recall that in our reserve-based lending activity, about 50% of the reserve is \u2013 I mean of the borrowing bases are natural gas reserves. So you really kind of have to focus on both.","But what I would say is that the underwriting that we did in our spring redetermination generally had prices, oil prices, around kind of in the mid-$30s to high $30s. And the sensitivity would have been down \u2013 in the high $20s, excuse me. High $20s, $30ish. And so if prices retreated here back to the high $30s, I don't think that would really impact our reserve. If we saw prices go down into the low $30s, high $20s, well then it might change how we would think about it. But I think there's a lot of room between where we are and that kind of really negative environment because fundamentally, the supply and demand curves have improved since six months ago, and that's fundamentally driving the price changes.","So that would be my comment. I think we feel really pretty good about the reserve-based portion of our portfolio. The deficiencies that we experienced in the spring redetermination all have very firm repayment processes associated with them. So we didn't have any big surprises on the reserve-based side in the spring redetermination. And it really is just an oil field service question fundamentally, and how long that'll go on. And we believe it'll go on into next year, even if prices continue to improve.","Brad Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you, guys. Good afternoon.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","On the loan production side, I just want to see if you can elaborate a little bit on where exactly are you intentionally tempering production, given concentration limits? I mean is it all term CRE, or is it certain types of CRE underwriting, and is it by market, and is there certain concentration measures that you're looking at? If you can help us with how you quantify that. Thanks.","Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. This is Michael again. We have very well-defined concentration limits by asset class and asset types, and there are some historic assets that have proven not to do so well, and we obviously have low concentration limits set for those. We're not doing anything necessarily to stimulate production in any one of those categories. We think we might be a little heavy on multi-family, so we're tempering production there, both construction and term. And I hope that answers your question.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Yes, all right. So what parts of commercial real estate are you still willing to put on the portfolio?","Michael P. Morris - Chief Credit Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, selectively, any transaction that has a really strong metric, solid sponsor, guarantor support, good market, deeper MSA that can prove as a worthy takeout source. The retail is obviously, the online sales, has kind of tempered our belief, and we aren't too excited about putting on a lot of new retail. Industrial is an asset class that is in favor right now to us, especially in the markets that we serve. Hospitality we have historically de-emphasized, but we do select hospitality transactions. I would say, anything that is horizontal development like A&D, land, lots, that aren't associated with homebuilder production and vertical construction, is an asset class that we're definitely steering away from. Historically it was in our mix, but today and going forward, it's a relatively small piece of the book.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, sorry if this was already discussed. I might have missed it. But just want to get your overall thoughts on the NIM trajectory here, in terms of, should we expect that, given where the new production is coming on and competitive pressures that we see erosion from here, or could you see some relative stability? Thanks.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, John, this is Paul. What I tried to convey in my remarks is that we've got some countervailing influences. One as you described is sort of the ongoing grinding of margins that we see, and that obviously adversely impacts the net interest margin. In our case, though, we are helped by the fact that we continue to deploy cash into our highly liquid investment portfolio. And the result of that obviously is no increase in earning assets, the denominator, but an increase in net interest income. So net-net, that's helpful to the margin. So as I was trying to say in prepared remarks, we're looking at maybe a couple of basis points, we think, over the next couple of quarters. But as you know as an experienced observer of banks, that can be pretty hard to predict sometimes.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. All right. Thanks, Paul.","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jack Micenko with SIG. Your line is now open.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey. Good afternoon. You talked about turning a little more cautiously optimistic on energy. Commodity prices are up. I think your exposure is down. But the cumulative charge-off number, it looks like it's been walking up. I think you were $75 million to $100 million, end of last year, and then kind of $100 million to $125 million. And it looks like on slide 18, we're now looking at $125 million. So is it a frequency issue? Is it a severity issue? I'm just trying to figure out what's changed there to kind of move that number higher.","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Jack. This is Scott. We had said $75 million to $100 million area. We comment on $125 million today. And as you noted, our energy net charge-offs were about $75 million through the first half of the year. And we're simply saying we think they will start to go down. We think they'll be less in the second half of the year. But it's very hard to know. We don't have a clear line of sight right now to those second half of the year charge-offs. We can see about half of them and then we're assuming others will materialize. So there is an opportunity for a favorable performance relative to the $125 million.","The other comment that I think is really important is how does this fit, as both Harris and Paul noted in their comments, how does this fit in terms of our overall thoughts about net charge-offs this year. Recall that we guided to 30 basis points to 35 basis points, $125 million to $150 million in net charge-offs. And clearly our energy charge-offs are going to be larger than what we thought, but we've only had $1 million in net charge-offs on the other 94% of the loan portfolio through six months and we are clearly going to have less charge-offs than we anticipated there.","So we continue to anticipate the same consolidated net charge-off experience that we guided to. It's just going to be a little more weighted to energy.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think I'd just also add, and I think, my perspective anyway. It's Harris. The most encouraging thing that I'm seeing is that we're not seeing new names popping up.","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","Right.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The list of deals where we expected that we might see some fraying, basically a year ago, hasn't really fundamentally changed. So some of the timing, to some extent perhaps even magnitude in some of these deals has been a little different, but we're not seeing new names coming out of the woodwork and I think that's a big plus in our thinking about it.","Scott J. McLean - President & Chief Operating Officer","It is. And I would also note because the vast majority of our charge-offs on to the energy side are coming from the oil field service fees. Recall that we've significant private equity sponsorship with our 70 some-odd service-based companies, our larger service-based companies that we finance. And to date, last year and through six months this year, they've injected about $250 million of capital into our borrowers. Just back of the envelope, that would be 15% to 25% in increased equity to those existing deals, which generally were 50% equity, 50% debt; I'm using some broad generalizations here.","So we've seen really strong performance from the private equity funds, when you think of 15% to 25% equity injections in an 18-month period. And with strengthening pricing in oil and gas commodity prices, we believe that'll continue.","James Richard Abbott - Senior Vice President, Director of Investor Relations","Okay.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's helpful.","James Richard Abbott - Senior Vice President, Director of Investor Relations","As to we're out of time on the debt part of the \u2013 so we'd like to take the last few questions, but just limit it to one question at this point, and we'll try to keep our answers concise as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D. A. Davidson. Your line is now open.","Gary Peter Tenner - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Paul, I was just hoping to clarify the comment you made on the margin. I would've thought that would be ongoing improving mix of earning assets that would certainly support stable, if not an expanding margin. Does that assume that the securities yields stay under pressure in the third quarter and fourth quarter, as they were in the second quarter from prepayment speeds?","Paul E. Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. That's precisely correct. Not only are we buying new bonds, which is helpful, but the bonds that we do have are prepaying faster. There's premium attached to those bonds that decrease in the yield, and that happens, as you know. And so there's a little headwind there that we're dealing with, in addition to ongoing kind of grinding tighter of credit spreads.","Gary Peter Tenner - D. A. Davidson & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Your line is now open.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could expand on the compensation comments, where you say tighter incentive comp is linked to achieving the efficiency ratio target. I guess on mortgage wealth management, that's pretty clear. So my question is, how are you driving your commercial bankers to be more efficient? Is it something that we can track on the balance sheet, the pricing yields? Or is it also a function of some of the fee businesses, capital markets, treasury, et cetera?","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think what we're fundamentally referring to there is we've got an incentive plan that covers top, roughly 450 or so officers of the company, that is effectively very closely linked to how we do in terms of cost control and continuing to develop operating leverage, et cetera. But the cost control is just kind of a central theme to how we think about payouts under that plan. So some of you have heard me say before, but I'd tell all of our people here that every nickel they spend, consider it it's not coming out of shareholders' money, it's coming out of kind of the top 450 people in the company, because to the extent that we don't hit those targets, the funding for that incentive plan is reduced to the point that we do. So there's a very, very tight linkage in that respect.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you.","Harris H. Simmons - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.","Harris H.

This call is being recorded. I will now turn the time over to James Abbott.","James R. Abbott","Good evening, and we welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2012 results. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. We will be referring to several schedules in the press release during this call. If you do not yet have a copy of the press release, it is available on our website at zionsbancorporation.com. We will limit the length of this call to 1 hour, which will include time for you to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, we'll turn the time over to Harris Simmons, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Harris?","Harris H. Simmons","Thank you very much, James, and we want to welcome all of you to this earnings call this evening. We are, obviously, particularly pleased by the progress we are able to make in the first quarter with regard to our capital plan, as I suspect most of you know, the reduction in our overall cost of capital and the simplification of our capital structure over the next 3 to 5 years should be one of the primary drivers of improvement in our profitability and return on equity. With redemption of $700 million of TARP at the end of March and with the targeted redemption of the remainder of TARP in the second half of this year, we will move meaningfully closer to what we believe to be the long-term earnings power of the company. ","Looking to the fundamentals, overall, we are quite pleased with the progress on asset quality this quarter, although there's some noise in the classified loan trends, which is mentioned in the release and which we will address a bit later in the call. But net charge-offs declined 43% from the fourth quarter level to an annualized 60 basis points of loans, which is a level that we haven't seen since the first quarter of 2008. ","We also saw some further decline in nonaccrual loans, which declined 4% sequentially. Nonaccrual loans are down more than 60% from the peak, but at 2.4% of loans we know that we still have some further work to do to get them down to a more normalized level consistent with our history. ","The softest spot for us in the first quarter was loan growth compared to the fourth quarter, which is something we also highlighted as a first quarter challenge at our last earnings call. ","As noted in the press release, most of this decline occurred in January and February. While average loans were essentially stable, the ending balance in March was down 1.5% from where it was at the beginning of the quarter. About 1\/2 of the decline came from owner occupied loans and about 1\/3 from commercial and industrial loans. ","This is partially driven by our business mix, which is skewed toward the small business customer, where we saw less demand in the quarter. We do see signs that borrowing for small business loan customers will strengthen in the second quarter. And as new financial statements come in and they're -- and these businesses continue to show a little more strength, we expect that more and more of them will be eligible for additional loans to expand their businesses. ","On the middle market and corporate banking side, declines in balances were generally attributable to a paydown on lines of credit rather than the loss of a customer. We are actually seeing some growth in commitments, but we're seeing line utilization down. Our line utilization rate declined to 32.3% from 35% just 3 months ago. So it's about as weak as we've seen it for some time. ","Although loan pricing remains competitive, it was generally stable compared to the prior quarter. We do see some moderate loosening of structure and terms in the marketplace. We have generally resisted that pressure and we'd expect to continue to do so. ","I'm also pleased to report that noninterest expense declined. This has been an area of focus for all of us, something that we continue to watch closely. Excluding the noisy items in the fourth quarter, expenses declined 4% from the fourth quarter. Much of this decline is attributable to an improvement in credit-related items, which is consistent with our past guidance. ","So that overview are some of the major items. I'll ask Doyle Arnold, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, to go through the quarterly performance. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thanks, Harris, and good afternoon, good evening everyone. I hope you guys on the East Coast are weathering the weather satisfactorily. ","As noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $25.5 million or $0.14 per diluted common share. We've also presented the earnings as we usually do in a way that excludes the noncash sub debt amortization impact and the FDIC loan discount accretion. And we think that adjusted for those items is useful to longer-term oriented investors, as we do not expect those income and expense items to be with us into perpetuity. ","And additionally, in the first quarter, we had one other item which we'll call out and that's the $20 million accelerated discount amortization related to the value attributed to the warrants in our TARP preferred that was then triggered by the redemption of $700 million of that TARP in late March. So that flows through as additional preferred dividends and that explains the jump of $20 million in preferred dividends this quarter. Excluding those items, the earnings were $0.33 a share. While there was some other modest fee income noise in the quarter, those items largely cancel out. ","Turning now to revenue drivers, which includes a discussion on loans and margin. On Page 12 of the release is a table of loan balances by type. Before we get the details, much of the balance -- decline in balances is due to a decline in production compared to the fourth quarter 2011. Production here includes both new origination, as well as draws on existing lines of credit. While production was down from the fourth quarter, it was very basically identical to the first quarter of last year. And on most -- on the most cyclical loan type, such as C&I, the linked quarter decline was pretty close to the decline we experienced last year as well. ","With that as background, commercial and industrial loans finished the prior quarter relatively strong, up 6% sequentially or $602 million, followed by a decline of about $178 million or 2% in the first quarter of 2012. C&I loans have been stable to modestly increasing since early March. Now if you recall at the end of the year, we cautioned you that we thought a lot of the run-up in C&I balances in the fourth quarter was some window dressing and it just kind of seemed too good to be true or to persist and that proved to be the case. We saw essentially all of that run-up reverse itself in the first 2 months of the quarter, and then begin to stabilize and there's been slow growth in just about every week since then, including through last Friday. So the window dressing appears to have been undressed and we're back to a normal, slow, incremental loan growth it would appear at this point. The new C&I loans are priced on average relatively neutral to our overall net interest margin with duration and credit quality consistent with prior quarters. ","Loan pricing has remained in a tight range for about the last 4 quarters. The decline in our owner occupied loan portfolio explains about half the decline in total loans this quarter, largely attributable to a decision made several quarters ago as part of our new concentration risk management efforts to selectively reduce certain aspects of our exposure in our National Real Estate business. For example, reducing exposure in geographic jurisdictions where local laws make problem loan workouts more difficult and time consuming. ","As many of you are aware, Zions is the largest SBA 504 lender in the country, both by number of loans and by origination volumes. These loans have very low loan-to-value ratios of origination and as a result, loss rates have performed materially better than other loan types, peaking at about 2.4% and following currently to less than 1% annualized year-to-date, basically, first quarter. It's a business we've operated for many years and to be clear, we're not exiting the business, but we have elected to exit select markets in such where the obstacles to collecting on bad debt are -- make it difficult or very cumbersome. ","We have also elected to reduce concentration in the hospitality sector of this portfolio. We do expect several hundred million dollars more of further contraction in this portfolio during the year, which will pressure the overall trend in owner-occupied loans. ","Construction, development loans did decline for the 16th consecutive quarter. However, the rate of net decline does appear to be slowing. And based on production statistics, we do expect the leveling off in this portfolio and possibly some growth later in the year. Most of the new construction loan balances are commercial, but residential development projects in some markets are strengthening and our commitments are now growing. Although relative to historical loan growth rates, we would describe demand for such loans as relatively modest at this point. ","Term CRE loans experienced continued growth and with the slower attrition in the C&D balances, total CRE loans increased for the first time in 3 years, basically, 12 quarters. ","Turning now to our net interest margin on Page 16. You'll note that the GAAP NIM compressed by 13 basis points, 8 basis points of which is explained by changes to non-core items such as the sub debt conversion and accretion on acquired loans as reconciled on Page 17 of the release. ","The core NIM declined by 5 basis points from the prior quarter, which is consistent with the guidance we gave on our call in January and at various investor meetings and presentations throughout the quarter. ","About 2 points of the core NIM conversion -- compression, excuse me -- core NIM compression was due to the increase in low-yielding, short duration cash and securities, and about 3 basis points due to the compression of loan yields. ","Loan yield compression is attributable to 2 factors: First, adjustable rate loans resetting to lower rates as the repricing index is lower now than it was several years ago when the loans were originally booked; and secondly, maturing loans, many of which had rate floors, were replaced by new loans at lower coupons or lower floors, compared to loans originated when spreads were higher. ","As we mentioned in January, we expect that the NIM will be under pressure throughout the next couple of years due to these forces by approximately 2 to 4 basis points per quarter. Nevertheless, if and as loan growth strengthens and we're able to trade cash for loans, the pickup in net interest income should offset the repricing pressure. ","Finally, the balance sheet continues to remain quite asset sensitive, where an upward parallel shift in the yield curve of 200 basis points would result in an increase to the net interest income of more than 10%. ","Turning to credit, I'll be fairly brief. I'll make 3 points. We're, of course, pleased with the material improvement in net charge-offs. Our NPA resolution volumes dropped somewhat from the fourth quarter, but resolution volumes were consistent with 2010 and 2011 averages. ","Favorable and unfavorable resolution rates were also consistent with the 2010 and '11 averages. We mentioned in the press release that there was a change in grading of loans in our National Real Estate portfolio. I want to point that out. This change in policy caused $175 million of loans that were fully current as to principal and interest to be downgraded to classified status in the first quarter. ","In the case of these $175 million, they were downgraded based on noncurrent, that is 2010, financial statements, to establish debt service coverage ratios and other ability to service the debt. Based on those ratios, the debt service coverage ratio was less than 1.2:1, resulting in net downgrade to classified. We believe that when we receive more current financial statements based on discussions with these borrowers, namely 2011 financials as they file our tax returns, et cetera, their financial condition and debt service coverage ratios will have broadly improved and that many of these downgraded loans will revert to pass grades over the next 2 quarters. ","This loan -- change in loan grading is a change in practice, not a true change in the underlying risk and it does not signal any expectation on our part that future losses coming from that portfolio are going to increase. ","Finally, I'd point out that construction development loans this quarter actually experienced a small net recovery, which is quite a change from where we were a couple of years ago, in the third quarter of 2009, we had $219 million of net losses in that category alone. So switching to a net recovery is quite a turnaround. ","Let me now refer you to Page 6 of the text in the release. We have changed -- we hope for in a way that's more informative to you, the way we present the CDO portfolio. As you recall, previously, for a number of quarters, we've been showing this table, kind of oriented around bank CDOs and other CDOs and then within each category rank, sorting them based on the original rating agency rating. We will show that table in the 10-Q, alongside this new table, but we are -- we think this new one is more descriptive of where we think the risk in the portfolio is and where we think the recovery potential in the portfolio is. ","The top part of this is -- it's basically now 2 broad categories, are performing and nonperforming CDOs. Notice the performing CDOs have a par value of just under $1.5 billion and a carrying value of just over $1 billion. None of these securities has ever missed a payment despite the severe trauma the banking system experienced, and we feel reasonably confident that we're going to get most of the discount in this portfolio back over time based on our cash flow modeling and so forth. This represents a potentially significant potential benefit to our book value and tangible common equity ratios. We recovered all of it that would be accretive to tangible common equity by about 7% to 8%. ","The nonperforming CDOs which are -- you can see there about -- just over -- just under $1.1 billion of nonperforming with a carrying value of $200 million, fall onto 2 categories: Those that have experienced credit impairment or OTTI recently, mainly within the last 12 months; and those that have experienced it in the past, but not within the last 12 months. ","We expect to see some of this discount in the nonperforming CDOs accrete back into equity. But if there's impairment to be taken in the future, we would expect most of it to come out of the $200 million of unrealized loss in those that have experienced credit impairment within the last 12 months, even as the OCI mark on other CDOs may improve. ","On a related note, I'd highlight that the AOCI mark improved modestly this quarter as a result of slightly lower risk premia on risky assets at the end of March compared to December. Additionally, I would note that both S&P and Moody's have begun to review and selectively upgrade bank trust preferred securities. And as those upgrades continue, we would expect that the market for these securities may begin to re-liquify or deepen and liquidity discounts to moderate somewhat. ","On a related note, of the $10 million and change that we took in OTTI this quarter, about 30% was due to prepayments on trust preferred issues that were in the CDO pools. So we are seeing that impact that we described in our Investor Day, but the remainder was due to model credit deterioration in a few banks in our exposure pool. ","Regarding capital, now the GAAP tangible common equity ratio increased to 6.89% from 6.77% in the prior quarter, and the Tier 1 common ratio increased to an estimated 9.70% from 9.57% in the prior quarter. While not yet a formally -- formalized regulatory ratio, we estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio fully phased in would have been approximately 8.2% at the end of this quarter, which is also a continued improvement from numbers we've disclosed to you previously. ","As mentioned in the release, we, and in the 8-K, we did redeem 50% or $700 million of TARP late in the quarter, leaving us with $700 million to go. We currently do still expect to redeem this sometime in the second half of this year. We also issued $300 million of senior notes to enable us to maintain a strong liquidity position at the parent company. ","Finally, turning now to guidance or outlook for the next couple of few quarters. We do expect moderate organic loan growth, which we expect to strengthen a bit as we progress through the year. However, yield compressions stemming from loan resets should act as an offset. And the net result may be a slight decline in net interest income in the second quarter. ","Future net interest income trends will depend in part on the rate of earning asset growth, particularly loans, which as I said, we do expect to strengthen a bit as the year goes on. OTTI from the securities portfolio should remain low as fewer banks are failing, more are recovering and our model is quite conservative at predicting failures. ","Offsetting this trend is faster bank prepayments for the underlying trust preferred securities, as we've mentioned. This has the effect of diverting cash to the senior tranches that we own, potentially improving AOCI, but removes future cash flow support from the mezzanine tranches, potentially resulting in additional OTTI. ","We do expect the net of those 2 effects to be accretive to tangible common equity. And for more detail about this phenomenon, where we went through some hypothetical scenarios to show you the modeled impact, you can refer back to our Investor Day slide deck from February 16. ","Noninterest expense should generally continue to trend stable to perhaps slightly lower, driven primarily by credit cost improvement, but also by, as Harris mentioned, our strong focus on continuing to improve operational efficiency. Seasonal expenses, like payroll taxes, will decline as the year progresses. And as loan origination volume improves, some of the compensation will be deferred rather than expensed through the salary benefit line. ","Our view of the economic climate is that we're still, we're in a generally protracted and tepid recovery in the U.S., while foreign countries, including Europe and the BRIC countries, are struggling with recession or slightly -- or significantly slowing economic growth rates. ","While we have no, virtually no direct foreign exposures, I think many of you know, we remain somewhat cautious about the potential impact on our domestic customer base, and therefore, plan to exercise caution with our lending standards, loan pricing and reserve factors. ","With that said, we're actually -- remain moderately positive with regard to the company's outlook over the next several quarters, particularly due to our expectation of continued improvement in credit quality. We expect net charge-offs to be stable to declining from the first quarter level, not a big step function down like you saw between fourth and first, but stable to a declining trend still from there. And we do expect, therefore, provisions to remain low and acknowledge the possibility that the provision may be negative in one or more quarters. ","With that, I will turn the session back to our moderator and invite you to queue up your questions and we'll do our best to answer them.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first caller in queue is Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","A quick question is that across the different geographies, we're hearing places like Phoenix and Vegas are starting to have some good asset price recoveries, a lot of investors coming into the market. Are you seeing different performances from the different geographies you guys are in, especially California versus Phoenix and Texas and Vegas?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'll see if Harris or Ken wants to -- Harris, do you want to comment on that?","Harris H. Simmons","I guess we are generally seeing continued improvement across the board. We saw -- we did see in the Nevada market some pretty good improvement during the quarter in terms of just credit quality. What we're not seeing is -- I mean, loan demand remains really weak in those markets, but we are seeing, even in some of these really tough markets, that things are getting better. We're seeing in the Arizona market, for example, better movement in the housing market. If anybody can qualify for a conforming loan, so in the reasonably priced kind of segment of the market, things are actually moving along. It's still weak in the upper end, but there are some very real signs of improvement in some of these tough markets.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then on price competitiveness, are you seeing different levels of price competitiveness in some of the bigger banks or is it pretty much it's very competitive out West across the board?","Harris H. Simmons","Well, I think, I mean you're seeing it pretty competitive across the board. We're -- I don't know, just anecdotally, I'm hearing less about a couple of players that were really aggressive 6 or 9 months ago, but it's still -- everybody's looking for the good deals and everybody is strapped for the quality earning assets, and so it's pretty competitive. And that's -- as we've said, starting to see it maybe a little bit in structure. So until we see some growth, I think we're going to continue to see a lot of price competition.","Operator","Our next question in queue is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Jeffrey Lengler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is actually Jeff Lengler filling in for Ryan Nash. Just on the available for security T-yields [ph], it looks like they're up about 60 basis points linked quarter, but the balances are down, is that somewhat related to TARP repayment, or is there anything else going on there?","Harris H. Simmons","We actually sold some U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter and which ultimately rolled into cash and now has been used to pay off the $700 million to TARP. So what you're seeing is that effect going on.","Doyle L. Arnold","I think you're seeing a subtraction of very low yielding securities from the securities mix, not a purchase of something that has an interesting yield at a longer duration.","Jeffrey Lengler - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then just secondly, on the classified loan reclass, was this an internal decision or was it driven by something on the outside? And was there any impact on the allowance or the P&L for the quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","There was OCC, their control of the currency asked us to make the change, to go down to a smaller loan size, where we analyzed individual financials and more aggressively go after those financials. And no, it basically had no impact on our assessment of risk, and therefore, of the loan loss reserve.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Doyle, just to start off on the last question on the provision expense, if the change in the grading of loans for classified didn't add to the provision expense, is there anything to read into the very low provision expense number this quarter, but still a little bit higher than we were expecting? Because your comments suggest the provision could be lower or negative going forward. So just trying to reconcile the 2.","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm tempted to turn the mic over to the gentleman who is here with us who runs our quantitative models and runs this whole process, but -- he, basically, runs the company now for bad debts. No, it's just -- I mean, we looked at that and we knew that question was going to come up because it is counterintuitive. But basically, all the trends are favorable and you shouldn't read much of anything into it. If I did turn the forum over to him, he would give you an erudite explanation of first derivatives and second derivative, rates of change that you'd -- eyes would glaze over, so I would just say don't worry about it, if you can do that.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I think I can probably do that. So can you, just a quick -- a quick follow-up question that was just on TARP, your comments in the release say second half of 2012, I think previously, we heard, sort of broadly, end of 2012. Are you trying to indicate that you could repay a little bit sooner?","Doyle L. Arnold","I hadn't even realized we made that statement. I think -- let me just say, I think the reality is probably are something along the following [indiscernible]. I think -- well, there's proposed regulations out there now that will require all of the top 30-ish banks to do another stress test, self-defined, at mid-year based on their balance sheets, more current. Probably the underlying reality is that there've been no rules published. I'm not sure what, if any, rules will guide that, but my current expectation is that we will do something along those lines and we probably then won't -- we will wait until we know the results and maybe have showed them to the Fed before -- and you put all this together and it kind of says late third or sometime in the fourth quarter, so it wasn't intended to be a change in guidance. Reality is it's going to be maybe in the last third of the year, I would suspect.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Penala with BOA Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Doyle, I appreciate the color that you gave on NII, but I was just wondering if you could help us size the impact of the resets? Because it sounds like that's what's driving your guidance for lower NIM quarter-over-quarter. So I guess how much of your loan portfolio will reset in 2012? And what's the delta in terms of the yield to throwing off that versus where it's repricing to?","Doyle L. Arnold","I'm not sure. I'll let James answer. James is raising his hand. He wants to answer your question. So we're going to give it to him.","James R. Abbott","In terms of floors, we broke it out a little bit in the Analyst Day presentation so you can see it by year that way. We broke it into 2012, 2013, 2014, in fact, so you can see it broken down there. But it is closer to the 3, 3.5 basis points per quarter when you add floors and resets together in the next 1 or 2 quarters. I think it's the next 2 quarters and it's what -- and then it starts to tail off. And as you get into 2013, it's about 2 basis points a quarter on the combined basis for those 2 different effects.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it.","Doyle L. Arnold","And that, I believe, is consistent with guidance we've given over the last couple of months.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the provision, I appreciate that there's a very mechanical process in terms of how it's going to be drawn down this year. But I guess as we're looking to a more normal run rate of earnings for Zion, what does the model say in terms of where the reserve can eventually bottom to? What's, sort of, was appropriate for the new risk profile of this company or pro forma risk profile for this company?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, really, to fully answer that question, you almost have to also tell me what rules you think the FASB is going to enact, and they are evolving, kind of even as we speak, from a incurred loss model much more strongly in the direction of an expected loss model, including probability weighted different economic scenarios, one of which could be a severe stress scenario. So until all that shakes out, I don't know where we'll settle out. At some point, what you ought to look at is really the -- what's a normalized through the cycle run rate of losses versus -- because what that's going to determine, on average, is what the provision is. And I don't know, I -- we have dramatically reduced our exposure to the loan category that caused a hugely disproportionate share of our charge-offs through this last cycle, namely land and development lending. So with that said, I don't know, maybe 50 basis points a year and then you tell me how many years of reserve we need -- we'll need to have under a FASB regime.","Harris H. Simmons","I think it's also -- it's a function of how the economy is performing, obviously, and that's something that -- -- beyond our control, so.","Doyle L. Arnold","But I think whatever that normalized rate of provision is and level of reserve is, we're probably still a year or 2 away from it. There is just too many other moving parts. But I think the general trend right now based on what we see is that the reserve will continue to come down and the provision will, for at least the next 2 or 3 quarters, will be in the neighborhood of 0, slightly positive to slightly negative.","Operator","The next question is from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just on the pipeline, just real quick, you talk about loans stabilizing in March. Can you talk about which sub banks are the bright spots in terms of the growth trends? And was it mainly C&I that you saw the strength or was it also in another areas?","Doyle L. Arnold","Term CRE and C&I and some of the term CRE was completion of commercial construction projects that are underwriting criteria for conversion into term loans. And in terms of geography, I think, probably Amegy was the strongest, again, and Vectra was pretty strong and California. Those were the 3 positive highlights. And Utah, on a net basis, was probably the weakest because that's where that National Real Estate loan portfolio that we are shrinking, intentionally, is housed.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, thanks for the color there. And just real quick on Amegy, what was most of the growth there? Was that primarily larger, with large corporate middle-market syndicated type credits or maybe some color there?","Doyle L. Arnold","It was C&I. Ken or Harris, do you have more color than that on whether it was syndicated loans or...?","Kenneth E. Peterson","I would just chime in on the syndicated credit side, our syndicated credit portfolio book on a net basis, so loans purchased minus loans sold, shrank by about $250 million linked quarter. So...","Harris H. Simmons","Syndicated book actually ran off.","Unknown Executive","We had broad-based C&I and some 20% in the energy sector at Amegy.","Operator","Your next question in queue is from Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","R. Scott Siefers","So I was wondering if maybe you could talk about kind of the capital structure going forward. I mean, obviously, that's going to be a big part of the story in the next few years. But now that you're part of the annual, or I guess even semiannual, stress test, how do you see that playing out? What kind of flexibility do you guys think you'll have to improve and simplify the capital structure? Or will it be kind of once a year, we'll get the outlook for what you plan to do for the following 12 months? How do you see that playing out based on what you've seen so far?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, there are few, if any, precedents for modifications to approve capital plans on an interim basis out there. I guess Citi, it sounds like either is planning to reapply. They were turned down, we were accepted. I think what I would guide you toward what we disclosed in our Investor Day back in February as current and still valid thinking on a long-term capital structure, namely that we would have 9% to 10% Tier 1 common even in paranormal times. With the current risk profile, we would have a couple of percentage points of preferred, which would, as a percent of risk-based cap -- risk-based assets, excuse me -- that would actually net to less dollars of preferred than we have outstanding today. And then some sub debt, maybe a small layer of sub debt and a couple of percent layer of senior debt. Now, it's going to take 2 to 3 years, as I indicated then, to get there, given call dates and other things like that. So I'm not sure if there's any more I could tell you, but I'll give you a chance to ask your follow-up on that regard, if you want.","R. Scott Siefers","No, I think that's broadly what I was looking for. I was just kind of looking for a feel based on having gone through the sort of first iteration. So that's helpful.","Doyle L. Arnold","I think, I will add that, of course, we've tried to look with keen interest at the CCAR banks, the larger banks, published results. And what the Fed found versus what they thought was their result, and of course, it's no secret that the Fed came up with a lot larger haircuts than the companies did, generally. The biggest difference seems to be in first and second mortgages and cards, which are a more modest part of our portfolio but nonetheless, it looks like the Fed has some fairly harsh models out there.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just wondering if you can update us on your strategy for the growth of the available for sale securities portfolio here, especially given that the portfolio was pretty stable this quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","I mean there's just not much out there to purchase that looks attractive from a duration and risk standpoint.","David E. Blackford","Here's the criteria. If you could find some of these securities, I'd be happy to talk to you. They need to be floating right because we don't want to give away the assets sensitivity. They need to have a low risk weighting because we don't want to reduce our capital ratios as -- so it means they probably need to be government or agency guaranteed, and I'd like to have them amortizing and I'd like to have them paid off in short of 15 years. And then I'd like to have the spread over LIBOR. So if you could actually come up with something like that, I'd be happy to discuss it with you.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is there anything in that bucket?","David E. Blackford","Not much.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I'm guessing we should sort of see this portfolio continue to decline, but maybe at a slower pace than we saw at the fourth quarter.","David E. Blackford","Yes. It will be slower. I mean, again, what made -- what caused it to drop in the fourth quarter, and of course, the averages are subject, or just what was described, is we had $700 million of treasury bills, which we actually cashed in, in the fourth quarter and that's the cash that we used to then pay down TARP or part of the cash we used to pay down TARP in the first quarter.","Doyle L. Arnold","And we have no more treasury bills, if that helps you.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is it basically all MBS? And also muni at this point, if I were to look at the composition?","David E. Blackford","We're own very, very little MBS. I think it's less than $200 million. Basically, the portfolio is made up of munis, about $800 million of munis. It's got some MBS, but then there are a lot of SBA pools, we have about $1.2 billion of SBA pools which are floating-rate amortizing and pretty much it.","David E. Blackford","[indiscernible] Of the CDOs, those CDOs, we still -- I mean we've given you a chart on the CDOs, that'll get you to the numbers. [indiscernible] the SBAs, the mortgage-backed securities and the CDOs, you'll get to the number.","Doyle L. Arnold","And the CDO portfolio is not growing.","David E. Blackford","That's right. It's shrinking through prepayments and OTTI, if you hadn't noticed.","Doyle L. Arnold","And the occasional sale.","Operator","The next question in queue is from John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us some more color around the -- your outlook for credit-related expenses going forward? I mean it came down nicely this quarter. I just wanted to get an idea of how much more room you have there to see some improvement?","Doyle L. Arnold","I think there's still quite a bit of room between where it is and where it will be in a really normal world, but it was quite a step down this quarter. You shouldn't expect that kind of a step down in the next quarter, I don't think. There was less OREO resolutions this quarter. There was a lot of OREO resolution in the fourth quarter, so there's a little quarter-to-quarter noise there. The general trend should, though, should be stable to continuing to decline from here.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then secondly on your moderate loan growth outlook, I just want to see if we can get some additional color there or maybe if you can quantify your outlook there in terms of growth, particularly following a quarter like this, where we saw the runoff outpace the production? And then separately, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the timing of your remaining runoff? I know you gave us a little bit of color there on construction and the National Real Estate, but let me get an idea of the timing of when we really see that end.","Doyle L. Arnold","I've got to be candid. I mean it's really hard to square the circle about loan growth. The banks continue to report that their pipelines are pretty strong. Commitments are increasing, but draws on commitments were, as I think we said earlier in this call, commercial line utilization is at its lowest point since I've been paying attention to it for 4 or 5 years now. And that's either a sign -- that's a sign of 1 of 2 things, either people are scared to death and they're paying down their lines or we have had growth in lines and new originations. So maybe they're taking out new lines and loading their pistol to fire away because they think things are getting better and it's hard to know right now. Generally, though, the pipelines remain strong. So the pace of conversion into drawn loans is somewhat frustratingly slow. On the decline in those 2 runoff portfolios, well, it's really 3, the smallest one is the FDIC-assisted loans, which are going down, kind of $60 million a quarter or so, and that will be slowly kind of accreting, slowing down as we get further and further into the pile. The National Real Estate decline of a few hundred million will occur kind of throughout the year, but should -- our general sense is that by the end of this year that portfolio should begin to approach a steady-state, I believe. And then the rate of decline in the C&D portfolio already seems to have shallowed quite a bit over the last couple of months. And you've probably read some of the reports that we -- that have been in the public about some revival in housing and we're seeing it more commercial maybe. But I think there's reason to hope, that reason to think that the C&D decline may be largely behind us, maybe reaching a steady-state within the -- or bottom at least, within the next quarter or 2.","Unknown Executive","I would just add. Was that Harris trying to...","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","No, that was me trying to say something else.","Doyle L. Arnold","Okay, go ahead. What's your follow-up?","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","No, I was about to say thanks for the color, but I believe you're elaborating?","Unknown Executive","Well, I was just going to say, John, that the commercial commitments were up 3% linked quarter, which is part of the reason why the line utilization rate fell. But it's just unclear when those draws will occur, if ever. So some of them are liquidity backup lines of credit, some of them are commercial -- or rather construction lines of credit, which we do expect to find [indiscernible] draw, right, when constructions starts, right?","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","That syndicated decline that you mentioned, the $250 million syndicated decline, was that partly related to the national CRE book?","Unknown Executive","No, no, that would be mostly out of Amegy and totally unrelated to the National Real Estate Group, which is owner-occupied kind of -- much smaller loan. The typical loan size there is around $1 million. Of course, the syndicated book would be multiples of that.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, why has the additional accretion on the acquired loans come off so much over the past 2 quarters? Is that $13 million, the new run rate we should think about?","Unknown Executive","Well, on a net basis, I mean we look at it from a net basis, where you've got your revenue minus your expenses. And they are very closely related, I believe, that ratio is about 75% or so. So of the revenue that we achieve on that, which as you point out is declining, 75% of it goes out the back door in the form of FDIC indemnification asset expense, which is in the other noninterest expense line item. So just from an overall materiality perspective, it's not impacting the numbers that much. But it's, as a function of -- what they do is they reevaluate the loans every quarter and make it -- in California, Nevada, most of it is California and they make a decision as to how much upside there is left based on performance of the quarter. And also the magnitude, the dollar amounts, dollar amounts are shrinking.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just to follow up on your earlier comments of not finding attractive options for the securities portfolio. I just look at the portion of liquidity in the money market investments has moved up to 70% from 50%, a year ago quarter. I'm just wondering, at some point, do you just acknowledge that this liquidity is going to be around for a while? And even though yields aren't great, 26 basis points is on the low side and at least maybe a portion of the money market investments should be invested in something?","Unknown Executive","Yes, December 31 of this year.","Doyle L. Arnold","What he is referring to is the expiration of the TAG program. The unlimited guarantee of DDA accounts. Most of the growth in our cash can be directly related -- linked to growth in DDA accounts, 90% of that is commercial DDA and we -- there's -- and we, probably all together it's about a $5 billion increase in commercial DDA balances, and we do remain cautious that toward year end, some of those balances may leave. But yes, I don't want to make light of the fact, it is quite a pile of cash and we do continue to look for opportunities that would meet most of David's criteria at least, and not miss on any of the truly really critical, and it is difficult. But yes, we do look for non-loan ways to deploy that cash, Steve. It's just darn hard when the Fed is basically trying to force you to go 10 years, invest in equities and do -- there's not much out there that doesn't present huge duration risk, but we're doing a little.","Unknown Executive","You can be assured that we've had many lengthy discussions in the asset liability management committee on this subject. And 25 basis points isn't very high, but if you want to go out the yield curve, you can go to 2 years on treasuries and get the same things.","Harris H. Simmons","We had 26 basis points as of this morning.","Unknown Executive","That's a problem and we acknowledge it and we're trying our best to come up with something that makes sense.","Operator","The next question in queue is from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Deposit costs are down 5% linked quarter mostly in the CD portfolio, which is still around 80 basis points. Just curious how you feel about your ability to continue to move those costs lower?","Doyle L. Arnold","Deposit costs?","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Unknown Executive","Joe, one of the things that from a CD perspective, we've still got a fair amount of room. The CD production this quarter was around 25 basis points for the new stuff. So we've got a fair amount of room to go on that front, that whole portfolios resets down, it takes about a year.","Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then other, was just wondering if you could quantify the seasonal impact of uptick in expenses this quarter, payroll taxes, et cetera, that should come out in the second quarter?","Unknown Executive","Linked quarter was about $5 million. So that was one of the pieces there, there were some benefits and other expenses in there that account for the difference and some of the actual jump expenses was due to a slower production volume, so less of the expenses associated with that production were deferred.","Doyle L. Arnold","And do remember, Joe, we called out last quarter, that there was a $6 million or $7 million onetime expense, employee-related, benefit-related expense accrual that hit in the fourth quarter and should not have been -- should not be in your run rate.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies & Company.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask about the other service charges line. It looks like it was down 15% or so year-over-year and there were some comments in the press release about -- would it being down a little bit on lower customer activity. But can you just talk us through just what the drivers of that are and how closely that follows production and client behavior?","Unknown Executive","Other services [indiscernible], it's Durbin. So Durbin, the year-over-year number comparison is Durbin. The linked quarter decline is actually to the point that I was making earlier about the slower production, and that was most of it.","Doyle L. Arnold","So its lower fees on new loans is what's he's describing there.","Unknown Executive","Our loan fees were down $1 million linked quarter, debit card fees were down $1.5 million. That's a seasonal consumer behavior as people spend, use their debit card a little bit less in the first quarter than they do in the fourth quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the commercial part wasn't that much of that decline, so it's not so much tied to the softer commercial loan side?","Unknown Executive","Right. Well and then swap fees. Swap fees was another thing that as customers take out commercial lines of credit, they will swap them, we will extend variable rate credit, generally, and they -- a lot of times they'll turn around and swap it, drop the interest rate risk exposure. That was about $2 million drop linked quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. My second question is, just coming back on expenses, overall. Clearly, a lot of helpers now coming out of the credit-related side. What else is there to do or can you do just to adjust for the revenue environment. I know you talk about just being as tight as you can, but do you have any plans on trying to take out any incremental costs or are there -- is there any low-hanging fruit just to continue to make sure you're aligned to the operating environment?","Doyle L. Arnold","Harris, do you want...","Harris H. Simmons","Yes, I might. Yes, just a couple of comments. I mean I think we've worked a lot of low-hanging fruit. We've made a lot of headcount reductions over the past -- really, in the 3 years. At the same time, we've had to add, I mean, the whole the Dodd-Frank environment that we're in has required us to add a lot of people. We're up, by my kind of rough count, depending on what you include in the numbers, but if you look at risk management staffing, generally, including credit policy and administration and compliance and information security and risk management staff, review new products and do model control and internal control testing and all of that. We're up about 75% over the last 4 years. So that's where we've seen -- that's why the numbers just aren't coming down in a much more pronounced way. It's because we've essentially been offsetting other cuts with required adds. But we're working in a lot of different areas. We've seen in the last couple of years, just one example, electricity consumption in our company is down about 10% over the last couple of years. We've been able to reduce our occupancy costs and so we're working a lot of different areas. We're working right now on a major project to centralize all of our mortgage processing, back-office operations across the franchise. Something that hadn't been done before. That's a project where we're working on a longer-term project will provide us with a much more efficient set of application system that will work together, and we think lead to a lot of savings in both back and the front office. So there are variety of things that we're focused on, but there's also some new costs out there in complying with the new world we're in. All the people doing stress testing, part of that 75% increase I'm talking about. So it's just the work that will continue to go on, but I don't see anything that's going to move the needle in a major way in a short period of time.","Operator","Our final question, then, will come from Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Just 2 quick ones, what's your pro forma preferred stock expense in the second quarter?","Doyle L. Arnold","That was in our 8-K and I don't have it in front of me. But if you go back and pull up the 8-K, I believe, we put it in there, did we not?","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","I mean on a consolidated basis?","Unknown Executive","On a consolidated basis, I think it's $34 million, is the number that comes to my mind.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC","Okay. And then just to clarify a little bit on that -- on the guidance, I guess or I'll call it guidance. I mean, you -- NII, exclusive of amortization and accelerated in regular amortization and FDIC, you still expect to be slightly down next quarter, is that -- did I understand that right?","Doyle L. Arnold","Probably slightly down in the second quarter.[indiscernible] revise quickly.","Doyle L. Arnold","Operator, I believe we're at the time limit.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's call.

You\u2019ve joined Zions Bancorporation Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Results Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.","I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James Richard Abbott","Thanks, Latif, and good evening to all of you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2016 fourth quarter and full-year earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer.","I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation, and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in Zions' strategic goals and have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.","We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer section. We ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","I'll now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?","Harris H. Simmons","Thank you very much, James, and welcome to all of you to join our call today to discuss our fourth quarter results. I\u2019m going to begin on Slide 3, where we\u2019ve some highlights for the quarter. Just note that earnings per share increased $0.60 from $0.43 per share in the year-ago quarter, a 40% increase.","Also note that 25% increase in pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue that reflects our continued achievement of strong operating leverage as we\u2019ve maintained tight expense control, while generating a 7.2% increase in adjusted revenue over last year's fourth quarter. I'll cover the rest of the key indicators listed on this page as we move through the presentation, and as well, Paul Burdiss in a little more detail.","Turning to Slide 4, I am very pleased to report that for the second year of the three-year plan that we articulated back in June of 2015, we\u2019ve accomplished all of our established goals. Financial goals were fairly aggressive. We worked very hard on many fronts to accomplish them.","As we look to 2017, we're again committing to further improvement of the efficiency ratio to the low 60s. We expect non-interest expense to increase slightly in the 2% to 3% range relative to the reported figure of 2016, which is consistent with our commitment made back in the mid-2015.","On Slide 5, we're pleased with the continued trend of strong increases in pre-provision net revenue, which is a result of both solid net interest income growth which as noted increased 7.1% over the fourth quarter a year-ago, and 8.1% and 5.8% improvement in GAAP and adjusted non-interest income respectively with the primary adjustments to GAAP measures being the elimination of securities gains and losses and fair value of non hedge derivative income.","Both of these revenue results were consistent with our targeted objectives, although much of the improvement in the net interest income came from the growth income from the securities portfolio. And we're working hard to make changes that will cause interest income from loans to shoulder more of the burden of growth for 2017 and beyond.","GAAP non-interest expense increased 1.8% and adjusted non-interest expense decreased 0.6%, respectively. All of this is resulted in this 25% improvement in pre-provision net revenue over the prior year fourth quarter as previously noted.","Turning to Slide 6, we posted an efficiency ratio of 64.5% in the fourth quarter and 65.8% for the full-year. Our goal for 2016 was to achieve an efficiency ratio of less than 66%, while maintaining adjusted non-interest expense below $1.58 billion. We encourage some expenses in 2016 that were outside of our planned estimates, such as accelerated retirement benefits, elevated healthcare costs, and moderate legal accruals.","However, at our Investor Day, in February 2016, I committed to you that we'd adjust the executive compensation downward if necessary in order to achieve the efficiency ratio on non-interest expense goals. And primarily as a result of higher healthcare costs in the fourth quarter, we accordingly made some modest downward adjustments to senior management incentive compensation in the quarter as disclosed further in the earnings release.","But also note that we are achieving all of this while making very substantial technology investments in new core systems and related projects. We will continue to work hard beyond 2017 to identify additional opportunities to become more efficient.","Moving to Slide 7, we experienced soft loan growth in the fourth quarter due in part to constraints on growth in our commercial real estate portfolio as a result of internal concentration limits and continued attrition in oil and gas loans, which declined more than a $150 million in the fourth quarter and more than $460 million over the year-ago period. We're optimistic that we'll see improved growth as we move through 2017.","Before I leave Slide 7, it's worth noting that we did experienced very strong deposit growth in the fourth quarter. Some of this is seasonal and include some large deposits by a small number of customers and we\u2019ve already seen substantial reversal with some of that spike in deposit growth in the first quarter -- we\u2019ve seen some reversal in the first quarter.","Slide 8, depicts the credit quality metrics of about 95% of our loan portfolio, but exclusive of the oil and gas segment which is about 5% of our total loan portfolio. We've historically had strong credit performance in our loan portfolio and we're determined to be a strong performer relative to the industry in the next credit cycle.","We don't currently see significant problems developing in any of our markets. Overall credit quality results were relatively consistent with those we reported in the prior quarter with a slight increase in non-performing loans and classified loans, but a decline in criticized loans.","Net charge-offs in the portfolio, excluding energy loans were less than $1 million for the full-year on a portfolio with an average $39.6 billion. We nevertheless recognize that it's unlikely that every year will be as pristine as 2016 was for this non-energy segment. So we're incorporated -- incorporating into our outlook some modest increase in losses for 2017.","Slide 9 is the depiction of the credit metrics for the oil and gas portfolio. We are becoming more optimistic about the outlook for losses and problem credit levels over the next several quarters as we're seeing some favorable indicators both within our portfolio and in the industry generally.","The metrics took a decisive turn for the better in the fourth quarter. Relative to the prior quarter, criticized, classified, and nonaccrual oil and gas loan levels declined 16% to 11% and 15%, respectively. As a result, we feel comfortable, modifying our outlook on provisions for the next four quarters to a level somewhat lower than what we\u2019ve reported for 2016.","With that overview, I'll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer to further review the financial results. Paul?","Paul E. Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $125 million or $0.60 per share. That's up from $0.43 per share in the year-ago period. We highlighted pre-provision net revenue, which increased 25% from the year-ago period as Harris discussed.","I'll also draw your attention to two key big picture profitability measures. First, return on assets has increased to 89 basis points, up from 68 basis points in the year-ago quarter. Return on average tangible common equity increased to 8.4% from 6.2% in the year-ago period.","We are committed to improving these measures of balance sheet profitability over the next couple of years and we are certainly encouraged by the recent improvement. The last item highlighted on this page is the efficiency ratio, which Harris already discussed in some detail.","I'll make a few comments about revenue first [ph]. About three quarters of our revenue comes from net interest income driven primarily by loan and securities growth, coupled with solid customer related funding. Slide 11 is a graphical depiction of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. As a reminder, the size of the circles represent the relative size of loan portfolios.","We experienced 6% growth in non-oil and gas, commercial and industrial loans. However, in the fourth quarter, these increased by about 1.7% on an annualized basis which we acknowledge as disappointing. As we had discussed in previous calls and at investor presentations, we expect growth in commercial real estate to be moderate going forward and indeed in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter CRE loans declined about 1% with the primary driver being our commitment to hold fast to our portfolio concentration limits.","We achieved 9% year-over-year growth in both 1-4 family mortgage and home equity loans, which is consistent with our desire for stronger growth in these portfolios. Such loans increased at an annualized basis of 7% and 10% from the prior quarter levels, respectively.","We expect non-oil and gas commercial and industrial, and residential mortgage loans to be the primary drivers of overall loan growth. We continue to expect a modest decline in the national real estate group loans and oil and gas portfolio loans. Although we expect a decline in 2017 from both portfolios to be less than that experienced in 2016.","Slide 12 outlines the recent trend in net interest income, which continued to demonstrate growth in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was up 7.1% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by a $5 billion increase of the investment portfolio \u2026","Harris H. Simmons","In the average balance.","Paul E. Burdiss","\u2026 in the average balance of the investment portfolio, thank you. Interest income from loans increased $8 million over the prior period or 1.9% increase. While average loan balances were up $2.3 billion or 5.7%, the yield on loans declined 13 basis points from the year-ago period. The decline in the loan yield was due to a change in the composition of our loan portfolio which migrated toward modestly lower yielding loans such as residential mortgages and also due to a decline in income from purchase credit impaired loans.","As shown in the box at the bottom right of that slide, Page 12, we remain positioned to benefit from rising rates. However, during the past two years, we have deployed a substantial amount of cash into highly liquid fixed-rate securities which reduced our interest rate sensitivity somewhat using the midpoint of the range shown a 25 basis point increase in the yield curve -- across the yield curve would produce approximately $20 million of additional net interest income annually, all else equal, including the size and composition of the balance sheet. It will take a few quarters for the impact of a short-term rate increase to be substantially recognized, as only about half of our loan portfolio is indexed to short-term LIBOR or prime.","Slide 13 provides additional information regarding our active management of the investment portfolio. We accelerated the purchases of high-quality liquid securities during the fourth quarter, increasing the securities portfolio by $3.2 billion. We expect to continue to purchase securities at similar pace through the first quarter of 2017 and we will continue to evaluate the company\u2019s interest rate risk profile as one of two key drivers of the size of the investment portfolio. The primary driver being the need to have substantial on balance sheet liquidity.","As a reminder, the size of the securities portfolio is not constrained by the level of cash on the balance sheet. We continue to exercise caution with respect to duration and extension risk. The mortgage-backed securities we are adding have a duration of about four years with a duration extension risk being only about half a year if rates were to rise by 200 basis points.","The duration of the entire securities portfolio including floating rate SBA securities, is about 3.2 years today. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicate that the duration of the portfolio would not change to any significant degree which is attributable to our discipline in purchasing MBS with limited extension risk and because the floating rate small business administration securities held in the portfolio are expected to prepay at a faster rate as the economy strengthens and rates rise.","Another key component of net interest income, the rate or yield of the investment portfolio and the loan production can be found on Slide 14. This slide breaks down key components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which was stable from the prior quarter at 4.11%. Income from loans purchased from the FDIC in 2009 was essentially unchanged relative to the prior quarter. The securities portfolio yield increased slightly this quarter attributable to reduced premium amortization as compared to the prior quarter due largely to a steeper yield curve. Our cost of deposits did not change relative to the prior quarter.","Turning to Slide 15 and noninterest income, total noninterest income equaled $128 million, up from $119 million a year-ago, which is roughly consistent with our targeted objective, but down from $145 million in the prior quarter. There were a couple of items worth noting that cause the decline from the prior quarter. First, in the prior quarter, you may recall, approximately $11 million of that income was attributable to strong valuation performance of a publicly traded company held in the Zions small business investment company portfolio. And we said at the time that we do not expect that income to recur or at least not regularly recur that source of income or loss as was the case this quarter is found in both the dividends and at the other investment income line items and in the equity securities gains and losses line item.","Secondly, the fair value and non-hedged derivative income line increased $7 million in the quarter, most of which was attributable to changes in the interest rate environment which cause customer related swaps to experience a mark-to-market increase in value.","Finally, loan sales and servicing declined from the prior quarter due in part to adverse valuation marks on mortgage loan rate lock commitments. This was about $2 million of contra revenue in the fourth quarter compared to $1 million of positive revenue mark in the third quarter.","Noninterest expense on Slide 16 increased 1.8% from the prior year, and if adjusted for items such as severance as displayed in the GAAP to non-GAAP table at the back of the press release and earning slides, noninterest expense declined 0.6% from the year-ago period.","During the quarter, we experienced some expense that was not fully anticipated. However, as Harris noted in his earlier remarks, elevated fourth quarter noninterest expense directly resulted in management incentive compensation that was $5 million less than planned in the fourth quarter.","As detailed on the slide, we expect total adjusted noninterest expense to increase between 2% and 3% in full-year -- fiscal year '17 -- full-year '17 when compared to full-year 2016 results. It's worth reminding everyone that there is seasonality to noninterest expenses, particularly with regard to the first quarter compensation related items.","On Slide 17, is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to achieving positive operating leverage and we believe at this point with more than 20% year-over-year growth in PPNR, we can declare that our actions are making a noticeable difference.","We are committed to the substantial simplification of our operating process -- processes. We continue to work hard to upgrade our technology systems which we expect will result in an improved loan and deposit and customer information infrastructure. When complete, this information should simplify our back office, provide additional data on a real-time basis to our bankers and customers and better enable us to adopt enhanced digital capabilities.","Regarding the capital with which shareholders have entrusted us, we are targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we\u2019ve seen today, and we are tracking towards those goals as discussed earlier. Regarding returns on capital, we are pleased to have made progress and returning more capital to shareholders. Of note, we have repurchased nearly 3 million shares or about 1.4% of shares outstanding at June 30.","Although it is premature to give specific guidance on our expectations for CCAR 2017, the results of our internal stress testing indicated that we have an opportunity to optimize our capital position to be more reflective of the manageable risks in the Company. Finally, we are absolutely committed to our history of doing business with a local community bank approach.","Slide 18 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which could be interpreted as an annual rate of growth in the mid single-digit range. We continue to expect net interest income to increase in the mid to high single-digit range, driven primarily by loan and investment securities growth. No additional rate hikes are assumed in this outlook, although additional increases in short-term rates are expected to improve net interest income.","Turning to the provision for credit losses, we posted a provision of less than $1 million in the fourth quarter, which includes the provision for both funded and unfunded loan commitments. So while we have the word increasing to describe the outlook for the next four quarters relative to the fourth quarter, we are increasingly optimistic that the credit deterioration we experienced from the oil and gas portfolio has turned the corner.","As Harris mentioned earlier, we don't think that 0.2 basis points of net charge-offs on the non-oil and gas portfolio for the full-year 2016 is sustainable. So as energy credit costs decline and we experienced a reduction in the reserve on that portfolio, we may experience a slight deterioration in the rest of the loan portfolio. When combined with provisions for our new loan growth, we feel comfortable with our outlook for a total provision expense including both funded and unfunded loans, of something similar to that which we experienced in 2016.","We expect the customer related fees, which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase moderately from the level reported in the fourth quarter. We currently expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase in 2017 between 2% and 3% relative to the 2016 reported levels.","We expect our effective tax rate to be in the 34% to 35% range in 2017 barring any meaningful changes in the tax code. We expect preferred dividends to be approximately $40 million in 2017. And as mentioned in my remarks earlier, we do anticipate redeeming up to $144 million of higher cost preferred equity in the first half of 2017. In light of the recent increase in our share price, this is a new outlook item that is diluted shares.","Zions stock appreciated from an average price near $30 in the third quarter to a current price in the low 40s. As you are likely aware, we\u2019ve approximately 35 million warrants outstanding. 5.8 million TARP warrants and 29.3 million warrants issued in 2010 to supply common equity capital to the Company at that time. The warrants have a strike price of around $36. The exact details and link to the prospectuses for those warrants are provided on our Web site under the warrant information link on the homepage.","As the average stock price rises and the weighted average strike price above the weighted average strike price, warrants increased diluted shares outstanding and are therefore dilutive to earnings per share. We\u2019ve identified in the appendix that Slide 21, which provides a view of the approximate dilution for each dollar movement in the average share price.","If the stock price would average in the first quarter near where it is today, we would expect the diluted share count to increase to approximately 210 million shares which is net of the share repurchase -- purchases we anticipate in the first quarter.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your question please.","John Pancari","I just want to ask about the efficiency ratio expectation. I know you\u2019re indicating your -- reiterating your commitment to the low 60s level for 2017 and that you came in around 65% ballpark for '16. And getting first that low 60s, can you just give us an idea of what that would interpret into? Is that a good way to think of it 60% to 63%, is that a fair assumption?","Paul E. Burdiss","Well, I think -- yes, clearly those numbers are in the low 60s. We\u2019re not going to give a knife edge kind of number in part, because we think we're getting to a place where we\u2019re going to be competitive in the industry. And low 60s isn't where we want to stop, I'll also say that. This isn't about trying to find a floor. But we also want to -- fundamentally I\u2019m wanting to be a little cautious about creating such a focus on that number that it could lead to perverse kinds of behaviors in the Company. We\u2019ve seen what incentives can do to cultures recently and I just don\u2019t want to have anything that's going to tip anybody over the edge in terms of doing something unnatural. So I am going to leave it kind of at that, low 60s is what we said we do a year and a half ago and that's where we intend to be. You will all have to judge whether we meet your expectations as to what that number means, but that\u2019s the reason for it.","John Pancari","Okay. Yes, what I was getting at is that, if it is let's call it 63% the high end of that, that\u2019s 200 basis points of improvement off of this year without any incremental assumed Fed hike. So, I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, where does that come from without the help of the Fed?","Harris H. Simmons","Well, you do have the Fed hikes that we had in December we anticipated that we were quite clairvoyant back in June '15 and understanding that the Fed was going to do that in December. As you recall, we had actually basically assumed that we would have one in December of '15 and one in December '16, which I think makes us more accurate than the Fed has been. But beyond that, we still have room for some securities growth. We expect we will see some resumption of some loan growth, and there will be a lot of continued focus on expense management. So anyway, we thought hard about the budget for this place, and it gets us to the place we think we need to be and we think it's doable.","Scott J. McLean","I would just -- this is Scott, John. I would just add to that that the fundamentals that we laid out in that June 1 2015 announcement as Harris notes about the repositioning of cash, loan growth, fee income growth keeping expenses flat and the term we have used for 2017 back then was slightly increasing in 2017. All of that without rate increases just like in '16 \u2026","Harris H. Simmons","Yes, beyond what we plugged in.","Scott J. McLean","What we had plugged in, right. The two rate increases that we\u2019ve plugged in December of '15 and '16. All of that just like we saw in '16, should allow us to continue to improve the efficiency ratio in '17.","John Pancari","Okay, great. All right. Thank you.","Harris H. Simmons","Yup.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America. Your question please.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good evening.","Harris H. Simmons","Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian","My question is on the CCAR. So there has clearly been a lot of momentum even before the election to raise the definition of a domestic SIFI from $50 billion to $250 billion. And I\u2019m wondering if that happens, other than obviously returning more of your excess capital to shareholders, is there anything strategically that you are doing now that is dictated by CCAR and previous CCAR results that you may be doing differently? And I guess maybe I\u2019m specifically thinking about, you talk about moderate growth in C&I and CRE, and I wonder how much of risk management is -- the regular prudent risk management that Zions management is used to executing versus something more stringent that is attributable to the current regulatory environment?","Harris H. Simmons","I guess -- let me take a stab at giving you my point of view. This is Harris. I think that as we talked about concentration limits for commercial real estate, I think we have made some changes during '16, particularly around multifamily as we have been -- became increasingly concerned that the rate of growth and that product type was not sustainable across the economy, and -- but more generally commercial real estate as a category is something that we are trying to be very prudent about. We are seven or eight years into a cycle, and while we don't see anything that -- I mean I actually think it's been a pretty responsible cycle. This credit behavior goes by peers and by what we see out in the marketplace. Nevertheless, I mean, we are deep into a cycle and so we\u2019re going to be careful about that. But I would say CCAR creates uncertainty that may incrementally create a little more caution here than we'd otherwise have. So we wouldn\u2019t -- we wouldn\u2019t don't want to behave recklessly. If we are not subject to CCAR I don't think it's going to change our behavior in any material way, but it probably gives us one last thing to be concerned about if you, because it's been such a precipitous. Now you get it wrong, it was -- it became kind of a nuclear event as we saw back in 2014. And so, that would be obviously welcome. We\u2019ve expressed before, we don't think that the Federal Reserve's levels are really built for a regional bank like ours. We think we have a different balance sheet mix and we think we would very much like to be able to use our own models that would continue to have regulatory oversight to help us think about risk appetite and the tolerances we have. And so, being relieved of the SIFI status would certainly be helpful in that respect. So I hope that's helpful. But it's not that we would -- you wouldn't see wild abandon here.","Erika Najarian","That was helpful. Just a follow up to that, how do you think if the SIFI buffer was raised, your expenses can potentially progress or is there any low hanging fruit in the regulatory side that could potentially be reinvested or go away your thoughts on that.","Paul E. Burdiss","Well, I think a lot of the expense was in building the framework and models. And there is clearly some cost to maintaining them to keeping them current, and I don\u2019t expect that we are going to jettison that framework. It's what we are using to run the Company today. But there are things, including for example the resolution plan, the annual cadence of this will become a little less expensive. So I think again, incrementally it would help. It would have been really helpful if we had this for years ago before we invest a lot of money in creating incredibly comprehensive modeling capability. So I expect that we go to a maintenance mode more than a continued investment mode in all of this. And that would be helpful, but it's not going to be a material big step change, if you will.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Eads of UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads","Hi good afternoon.","Harris H. Simmons","Good afternoon.","David Eads","Maybe -- could you talk a little bit about kind of the direction or the pace of bringing down the asset sensitivity, you talked about it. We can see it coming down this quarter, and I guess it seems like you are going to continue adding more securities and then obviously adding the mortgages on the balance sheet. And I guess, when we think about what the limiting factors you guys looking at? Is it kind of the average of the sensitivity in the slow and fast deposit beta [ph] scenarios or is it certain amount of two another rate hike. How do you guys think about that?","Paul E. Burdiss","Well, this is Paul, David. We have an [indiscernible] committee that meets on a regular basis, so we consider balance sheet sensitivity in the context of the shape of the yield curve and kind of the return that we can earn or that we might be leaving on the table as it relates to the -- relative size of the duration of the asset and liability side of balance sheet. So I wouldn't say explicitly that there is a target other than to say in the past we\u2019ve been as you know very, very asset sensitive. And we have been bringing that down over time. I think it's the view of the committee that we will continue to work that down. As you know, cash and securities aren't the only way to do that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that while we continued at a pretty good pace of adding securities in the fourth quarter, that's going to continue likely through the first quarter, but after that if the committee chose to we can continue to work down that asset sensitivity through interest rate swaps to the extent that the shape of the curve looks attractive on the balance sheet. I will say historically the other thing I should note is that historically we have published a fast and a slow asset sensitivity. I think moving forward as we get into 2017, we are probably going to be publishing one baseline number and then probably publishing some sensitivities around that. So rather than having kind of the guardrail of the fast and slow, we\u2019re going to provide more of a maybe a midpoint estimate for lack of a better term, and then provide sensitivities around that, which we think will be just as valuable or perhaps more valuable to investors.","David Eads","Okay, very helpful. And then, maybe looking into 1Q, you talked about the loan mix kind of resulting in a flat yield or average yield on loan, presumably we should see more of a benefit from the December hike in 1Q results and probably that would offset the mix shift there, but maybe the upside is less than what we saw from the hike from a year-ago? Is that all kind of reasonable in thinking about 1Q?","Harris H. Simmons","Yes, I think so. It should be. I would expect it should be roughly comparable to what we saw last year. You are right about the mix shift and you are right about the timing. The rate increase income to the end of the year, we got a lot of things that kind of replace in the next month or quarter after that. So you\u2019re going to see that work in the first and second quarter. And it should be roughly consistent in terms of margin pick up. I believe to what we saw last year.","James Richard Abbott","Yes, the only thing, David. this is James. I'll just jump in. The last year we had a large headwind from the income from purchase credit impaired loans are the ones we bought from the FDIC in 2009 and that we still have some income from that, but it's pretty small compared to where it was in the fourth quarter of '15. So there is less headwind to work through there. So you might see it shine through a little bit more this time around.","David Eads","Hi, guys. Great color. Thanks","James Richard Abbott","Thanks, David.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dave Rochester","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Harris H. Simmons","Hi.","Dave Rochester","Just back on the NIM discussion, it just seems like there are a lot of moving parts there for the NIM in the first quarter with a lot of support, you've got the cash going to securities, the decline in securities premium NIM, the rate hike, anyway you could frame what you expect the benefit will be overall for the NIM in 1Q and then just based on your assumptions you\u2019ve for the year I\u2019d imagine you are thinking NIM expands through 2017, but probably has the biggest move up in 1Q, is that fair?","Harris H. Simmons","Well, a couple of things. I can't be any more specific around kind of a point estimate for net margin in the first quarter. You correctly point out that there is a lot of countervailing influence is there. The repricing of the SBA bonds for example, much slower premium amortization on some of the fixed rate MBS. We've got -- while we are not seeing spread compression necessarily in the loan portfolio, we are seeing a continued change in the composition of loans, which have the effect of reducing the overall loan yield. That\u2019s kind of a headwind and as you point out a tailwind is the rate increase. We are also expecting -- my expectation is that we will be able to maintain deposit rates close to where they are at. That's going to be kind of a heavily competitive driven situation. But my expectation is at least for now we are going to be able to maintain that. So that your point there's a lot of things that obviously impact the net interest margin. On balance, I expected to be a little higher in the first quarter. As we move throughout the year it's hard to see with absolute clarity whether or not the gain that we are picking up from the rate increase this quarter is going to -- is going to be offset by those continued composition changes in the loan portfolio. But I would expect as we have seen over the course of last year, I'd expect that NIM to continue to be quite strong.","Dave Rochester","Then are you assuming any further curve steepening in your assumptions? I mean, you\u2019re talking about number rate hikes, but what are the steepening, I missed that part.","Harris H. Simmons","I\u2019m sorry, the question was about the impact of steepening?","Dave Rochester","Yes, it is in terms of your NII assumptions, your estimate for NII growth. Are you assuming any additional curve steepening to what we\u2019ve already seen? And then I know you\u2019ve said no more rate hikes, so I was just wondering about additional curve steepening [indiscernible]?","Harris H. Simmons","Yes, sorry. Our balance sheet is very sensitive to the short end of the curve, so that would not necessarily change the outlook. Another point though that is worth mentioning, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the security purchases are not dependent upon cash available on the balance sheet. Obviously what that implies is to the extent we buy bonds beyond the cash that's available on the balance sheet, we are incrementally funding those. And so the marginal benefit, if you will, would be lower on those incremental purchases than what we've seen over the course of the last 18 months, because of that point you are no longer replacing cash with securities, but you are actually going out and funding those. So it's kind of yet another complexity as you think about net interest margin and the outlook there.","Dave Rochester","Yes, that makes sense. I guess, I was thinking about securities reinvestment rates going up over time and it seems like you're going to be having a lot more in the way of purchase activity there. I was just wondering where purchase rates are today overall? I know you're buying a lot of different types of securities, but \u2026","Harris H. Simmons","Yes, we are. Overall it's probably a little over 2 -- kind of between 2 and [indiscernible] is kind of where we are buying bonds today.","Dave Rochester","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Harris H. Simmons","Okay. Thank you, Dave.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good afternoon. I was wondering just on the expense side, the increase for this year that was kind of expected, you talked about the technology plan continuing to move forward. I\u2019m just wondering if you could update us on the progress of the technology spending, specifically when do you expect that to peak and will that depending on your answer to peak, provide any tailwinds to future expense growth as we get out of '17? When does that start to come back to us in terms of that net efficiency improvement?","Scott J. McLean","Sure, Ken. This is Scott McLean. So our core transformation project and all the related projects that was laid -- that laid the groundwork for that fundamental technology project, we\u2019re well underway with all of that. We have basically disclose that the expense increase -- that's in our run rate right now, it was about $25 million in 2016. It will be in the low 30s this year. So there is only about a $6 million headwind, if you will, $6 million, $7 million, $8 million, in 2017. And this is a multiyear project. It's going to be going on for the next three, four, five years when you think about all elements of what we are doing. And as for how it will what the expenses will be in '18 and '19? They could be slightly higher than that 2017 level. But we really have not made a forecast or speculated about a forecast publicly in those years.","Ken Usdin","And as a follow up, you talked about what you have had as a partial offset to the spending. Is there anything else that you guys would contemplate on top of what you\u2019ve already done to help self fund that tech infrastructure expenditure, because I think at some point there is an expectation that that gets to be a net positive, and your point is that it might be a little further out, so \u2026.","Harris H. Simmons","Absolutely. ","Ken Usdin","So what else is going underneath the surface as far as that\u2019s concerned?","Scott J. McLean","Right, Ken. So the incremental expense impact that I described is sort of the gross expense impact, if you will. So there are cost savings that we are identifying all along the path, some of which has to do with the technology itself and the expense savings that will allow us to achieve and I would say 2018, '19, '20. But most of it really relates to the fact just a continual process evolution we have had towards adopting common practices across our Company. We believe that in the narrowest sense that allowed us to save about $11 million in 2016. We believe that number will go up by $6 million, $7 million this year. It will be $17 million, $18 million in cost savings from just adopting common practices. And by the time we get to 2018, 2019, we believe that savings run rate will be in the $30 million to $40 million range. So the run rate I was talking about was sort of gross expense impact on the P&L, all of which will be offset or large part will be offset over time by the savings that we\u2019re creating, so which is directly related to the technology other of which just had to do with the adoption of common practices.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. Thank you for the color, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your question please.","Bradley Jason Milsaps","Hey, good evening.","Harris H. Simmons","Hi, Brad.","Paul E. Burdiss","Hi, Brad.","Scott J. McLean","Hi, Brad.","Bradley Jason Milsaps","Hey, Scott, just wanted to follow-up maybe Texas for a moment. In the appendix you talk about the Houston CRE book polling in really well, it looks like it's as good or better in some cases in the rest of the CRE book, but just kind of curious if you could add any more color to that, there was a public REIT in Texas last week out with some pretty tough comments around at [indiscernible] rents at their Analyst Day, being down 35% or something kind of from the peak, but just curious any other color you can provide there. It looks like you guys are holding in quite well, but anything else you could add that would be much appreciated.","Scott J. McLean","Sure, Brad. Happy to do that. You can see the relative size of our CRE exposure in Texas which is on Slide 24. And as you will note, about 60% of it is in the Houston area, San Antonio, Austin, the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, other areas where we have exposure, those economies are doing just fine. We don\u2019t want a broad brush, but they really are doing just fine. The real issue is in Houston and it's important to note in the Houston portfolio that there is virtually no exposure to land, number one. Secondly, that the term exposure versus construction, it's about 70% term, 30% construction. And when you think about it, our office exposure which is headline news almost weekly across the country people want to write articles about the Houston office market, we have very limited exposure there, most of which is well into lease up. Generally speaking, projects less than a dozen by the way that are in the kind of 50% to 60% debt to cap. The multifamily area is clearly where the greatest weaknesses is. Industrial retail are doing just fine. Hospitality is showing some weakness, but really multifamily and our multifamily exposure is -- interestingly most of our multifamily projects that are in lease up are achieving within 5% to 10% of what our bank rate assumptions were. So, all in all, and what we are seeing from a deterioration standpoint, in the fourth quarter we saw a little bit of deterioration in the CRE portfolio, but not material. And we\u2019ve had virtually minimal nonperforming assets and no charge-offs at this point. So the underwriting has held up really quite well.","Bradley Jason Milsaps","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. I guess going back to Paul's comments, you were talking about self funding the securities portfolio growth. Obviously this quarter had really strong total deposit growth, but how much of that is actually like a planned activity by management? Like we think about the securities growth, it's not dependent on cash, but are you changing how you gather deposits or the rate that you\u2019re paying on deposits in order to build the securities portfolio faster than you may have otherwise?","Paul E. Burdiss","Yes, this is Paul. Thanks for your question, Ken. I view deposits as critically important component to the value of the franchise. And so, regardless of what we\u2019re doing with securities, we're going to be designing products and pricing them competitively and trying to bring in as many client driven stable deposits as we can. I mean, there is a lot of value there both in terms of profitability, but also liquidity. So I would not say that there is a direct linkage. Obviously to the extent you have a lot of deposits and exceeds your ability to grow loans, which has been pretty rare, in ancient history, but not so rare recently, that can help to fund securities growth. But short answer to your question is they\u2019re not necessarily linked. The other thing I'd say, which I think we said in our prepared remarks is that a lot of the deposits that we saw in the fourth quarter were seasonal and so we\u2019d expect those to migrate away in the first quarter. I hope that answers your question.","Scott J. McLean","We haven't fundamentally changed our pricing or -- I mean you see the pricing is actually very -- totally stable between the two periods. It was actually down just a little bit on the savings and money market category. So anyway, they\u2019re really not connected that way.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. That helps. And then just a quick question, in terms of the provision, the guidance that '17 is essentially in line with 2016 provision expense, at what point is the reserve release, and then presumably a lot of it relates to the oil and gas portfolio, but at what point does the expected reserve release in the oil and gas portfolio slow to the point where you start to see an acceleration again, like how quickly does that run off?","Scott J. McLean","Ken, this is Scott. The reserve even though the percentage went up just a tick in the fourth quarter, the actual dollar amount in the reserve went down a bit. And so we saw some relief there. And I think we\u2019re being cautious about our outlook for the year. Clearly everything we're seeing is in the fourth quarter was pretty favorable happy to talk about that, but I believe that on the side for right now. And so, I think our basic assumption is if we continue to see the kind of improvement we saw in the fourth quarter, then you can certainly make a case that you wouldn't be reserving for charge-offs as they occur, and you can see that that reserve is about $200 million. So there is quite a bit that can come down there. You just have to pick what percentage do you think you would want to keep against the portfolio long-term and there is quite a distance between where we are in that percentage.","Harris H. Simmons","I think implicit of what we\u2019re saying is kind of a rotation from out of the energy reserve into just probably something that looks a little more normal than the rest of the portfolio. By more normal, as we point out, I mean, $1 million net charge-offs on the $40 billion portfolio isn't what we think obviously sustainable much as I'd love to see it. So, its -- I expect -- I would expect over the next couple of years we\u2019re going to have pretty low charge-off ratios in the rest of that portfolio, but I don't expect them to be quite that low and so we\u2019re just kind of making in the possibility of some kind of normalization there.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Okay, thank you.","Harris H. Simmons","Yup.","James Richard Abbott","Latif, this is James. We just have a few minutes left, if we can go into the mode where we do one question per questioner and happy to take more questions offline from those same people if they\u2019re interested in follow-ups. But we try to speed through the list here.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your question please.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there. Thank you for taking the question. The weakness in C&I outside of oil and gas, you mentioned that it would be a bit disappointing in the quarter and that feels like it goes broader than Zions to other banks and industry data. What do you think is happening there? We hear lots of banks talk about their customers being more optimistic after the election, but so far it doesn\u2019t seem to have manifested itself in loan growth. So what do you think is behind that?","Harris H. Simmons","I mean, they just finished counting the vote. I guess, it takes a little bit \u2026","Geoffrey Elliott","But it feels like it's going the opposite way. It kind of feels almost like it slowdown if you look at some of the data.","Harris H. Simmons","I guess, what I\u2019m saying is that, you\u2019re not going to see the effects of anybody's optimism reflected I think that quickly. I\u2019m hoping you will see that play out during 2017. You know beyond that, we saw just -- I don\u2019t know, somewhat was just kind of idiosyncratic we saw some larger pay downs, we didn\u2019t see lot of larger deal originations late in the year as sometimes we would typically see and so I don\u2019t know, Michael do you have any of this? Michael Morris, our Chief Credit Officer is here.","Michael P. Morris","No, I will just add to what you\u2019ve said that in the fourth quarter the election wasn\u2019t determined, so that\u2019s when deal flow would have picked up. We had the kind of loan growth we expected in C&I, so now that the election is over, I think we\u2019re looking at the first quarter to see what that translates to potentially in the second quarter.","Scott J. McLean","If I could add one more thing, I will point to slide 29, where we kind of -- its in the appendix, it\u2019s a slide that we\u2019re providing on regular basis and it shows linked quarter growth kind of by our affiliate banks and by type. And you can see that obviously we\u2019ve a continuing headwind related to oil and gas and natural real estate C&D [ph] loans. And so we -- that was certainly a contributor to the fourth quarter.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Your question please.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hi, everybody.","Harris H. Simmons","Hi.","Steven Alexopoulos","Just a follow-up on the comments around C&I. One thing that stood out to me was your expectation for only moderate growth in C&I in 2017. I\u2019m surprised, you\u2019re not expecting a bit of an increase. I understand the drags you are talking about in this quarter and this year, but when you think about pipelines building, are you just been conservative or is there something going on that you\u2019re not expecting better commercial loan growth this year? Thanks.","James Richard Abbott","This is -- Steve, this is James here. One of the things that that we\u2019ve made some adjustments to is on the multifamily side which you\u2019re not asking about, but we also have made some modifications on the leverage lending side as well which is maybe one of the considerations.","Scott J. McLean","I would just add to that too, we -- again if you sort of bench back to June 1 of 2015, we called for mid single-digit growth in loans and we haven't really changed our opinion about that. Over the last 18 months we've had some consecutive quarters of softness, we\u2019re experiencing that now. In C&I I\u2019m talking about specifically and -- but year-over-year we have solid progress there, that bubble chart that we show in here, shows that we\u2019re growing year-over-year in the areas we want to, but we\u2019re going to have some soft quarters in there and we think we\u2019re in that kind of phase right now, but by the middle to the end of this year we think we\u2019re going to put up loan growth numbers consistent with what we did for last year.","Harris H. Simmons","I just --- I would just add, this is really important topic I think, something we talk a lot about. Number one, it's just -- its hard to forecast. Now let me start with that. We haven't -- if we were really good at forecasting interest rates, we\u2019ve not been very good at forecasting loan growth. And it's -- so I think there's a tendency to be cautious given the fact we\u2019ve had a couple of quarters of slow growth. On the other hand, there are some things we\u2019re doing, I mean, we\u2019re just completing a reengineering of the way we approve and fund business banking loans. So these are credits, kind of small business credits or particularly in the $500,000 up to about $3 million range, that is going to make it much faster, I think a much better experience for customers and for our own people. And I expect that\u2019s going to be in place by late second quarter. I actually think that's going to help a lot, we\u2019re adding more mortgage loan originators. There are things that we\u2019re doing that could speed this a little bit, but I think we\u2019re made cautious by the fact we had a few months of slow growth here. And hopefully, just to the prior question, attitudes about the economy etcetera, will play a positive role too in stepping up originations.","Scott J. McLean","I just want to emphasize again what I\u2019ve said earlier and Harris said earlier too, our whole plan is not built around 10% loan growth. Its built around mid single-digit loan growth and the other elements that you know that we\u2019ve talked about, so we\u2019re not happy with the level of loan growth in the fourth quarter, but nor we fearful about being able to put up the year this year similar to the 2016 full-year results.","Steven Alexopoulos","Fair enough. Thanks for all the color, guys.","Harris H. Simmons","Yup.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR. Your question please.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, good evening. Just want to be sure I heard you correctly, that the expected diluted share count is 210 million in the first quarter of '17? And if that\u2019s right, I know you can't perfectly predict stock price, would it be your expectation to buybacks are sufficient to bring that down through the course of the year?","Harris H. Simmons","Obviously you guys can't even perfectly predict stock price.","Paul E. Burdiss","This is Paul. What I said was that 210 million assumes the stock price is similar to what it is today and that also incorporates the expected buyback in the first quarter. So that is a net number.","Bob Ramsey","For the first quarter not full-year, but for the first quarter?","Paul E. Burdiss","For the first quarter, yes.","Bob Ramsey","Okay.","Paul E. Burdiss","And again we got an extra page in the appendix just so that you can choose your own path for a stock price and kind of assess from there, where you think diluted shares are going to be.","Bob Ramsey","Looking at that page, I mean, how much of dilution was there in the fourth quarter and what was, I guess, the average price in the fourth quarter?","Harris H. Simmons","Bob, it's about 1 million shares worth of dilution due to the warrants and then I might also add that there are some stock exercise, some of the employees exercise stock option, so that was a driver of the -- some additional shares.","Bob Ramsey","Okay.","Harris H. Simmons","I don\u2019t have [technical difficulty]. Average share price in the quarter was -- about 37. It was about a $1 over the weighted average price -- weighted average exercise price of the warrants.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And have you all given any thought to, sort of as you think about CCAR next year, considering doing something about the warrants, as opposed to common share buybacks, or addressing them in some way?","Harris H. Simmons","That\u2019s really always part of our -- as we think about capital planning, we\u2019re thinking about all the capital instruments outstanding, preferred stock, and warrants and common stock, so that\u2019s really part of our thinking and then we just try to sort out where the best value for shareholders is as we think about returning capital.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for giving me a little extra minute here, to be able to get my question in.","Harris H. Simmons","You\u2019re welcome, Marty.","Marty Mosby","I was basically looking at the sentence where you said, future net additions to securities balance is not limited by cash. I\u2019m trying to take that, and look at your liquid assets on the balance sheet, which didn't change over the last quarter, even though you added so much in the securities, because deposits ran up.","Harris H. Simmons","Yes.","Marty Mosby","And then now, what\u2019s happening is those deposits are going away, aren't we going to end up with a little bit of a pinch there? And Paul, is that why you were kind of already foreshadowing that future rate sensitivity would be adjusted through swaps more than the securities portfolio?","Paul E. Burdiss","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t call it a pinch, I would call it kind of a movement toward a normal kind of balance sheet net funding position. And as I said, I was -- I\u2019m anticipating that securities growth will continue through the first quarter, but we're going to ultimately get to a size of a securities portfolio that we\u2019re comfortable with to manage on balance sheet liquidity. And then from there on we\u2019re going to need to manage our interest rate sensitivity through other mechanisms such as interest rate swaps, that's really what I was trying to get at.","Marty Mosby","I got you. I just didn't know how much of that big run-up in deposits, which was a big number, it was almost funded the complete increase in securities, if that\u2019s going to all go away, then that starts to force you to start borrowing short-term, or begin to do some other things on the balance sheet. So just looking at it, you would be fairly effectively managing the deposits at that point, and then from there on you would use swaps like we talked about?","Paul E. Burdiss","Yes. Couple of things. One, you can look at deposits last year, fourth quarter to first quarter and you can see that what we saw on the fourth quarter and what we\u2019re expecting in the first quarter is kind of seasonal and we have seen it previously. The other thing I would out which, I know, you know Marty is that we really have zero incremental kind of wholesale borrowing. We are like a 100% deposit funded as an organization. And as a result, are in extremely strong sort of net funding position. So as I said, moving into the kind of a net borrowed position over time, and it's going to be probably relatively small, is completely normal in the context of our balance sheet.","Marty Mosby","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","Kevin Barker","I just had a quick question on the securities balances, they\u2019ve obviously grown quite a bit this quarter and have grown to close to -- a little over 23% of interest earning assets. And you let on, that you may continue to increase that balance, which I'd assume would be from other funding. At what level do you expect or are you comfortable getting the securities as a percentage of interest earning assets?","Paul E. Burdiss","We haven't provided that level specifically, but I think I would point to the remarks that I\u2019ve made, which is we saw a decent amount of portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter. Our expectation is that kind of continues into the first quarter and then that\u2019s probably going to be as we think about size of the portfolio, there is probably not going to be a lot of incremental need to continue to increase that balance sheet liquidity after the first quarter.","Kevin Barker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?","James Richard Abbott","Thank you everyone for your time today. We appreciate your attendance and your interest in Zions, and we look forward to speaking to you in the future at a conference or at the next quarter's earnings call. Thank you and have a great evening.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the program. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day."],"23272":["Zions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2018  5:30 PM ET","Executives","James Abbott - IR","Harris Simmons - Chairman and CEO","Paul Burdiss - CFO","Scott McLean - President and COO","Michael Morris - Chief Credit Officer","Analysts","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","John Pancari - Evercore","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Dave Rochester - Deutsche Bank","Steve Moss - B.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host for today, James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","James Abbott","Thank you, Sonia, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2018 second quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives; after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook over the next four quarters. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer.","Referencing slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full release as well as the slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout our disclosures. ","A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. During the question-and-answer section of this call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons. Harris?","Harris Simmons","Thank you very much, James. We welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our second quarter results. The results of the quarter were strong, relative to year ago results. On slide 3, you can see the improvement of earnings to $0.89 per share, up from $0.73 in the year ago period. There are a couple of notable items that affected the EPS growth. First, in the year ago period, there was about $0.05 per share of interest recoveries, which we called out at that point as somewhat unusual in nature. At least, the dollar amount of the recoveries in that quarter was unusual and indeed in the second quarter of 2018, we had only a fraction of a penny per share of that same income.","Secondly, the change in the tax rate had a materially positive impact on the earnings, relative to a year ago period, which was worth about $0.11. Adjusting for those two items, in an effort to make results more comparable, we experienced about a 12% increase in EPS over the prior year period. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2018 continued the trend of strong growth with solid pre-provision net revenue growth. ","Although non-interest expense was higher than expectations and we acknowledge it was somewhat higher than our outlook from a year ago, we've experienced a stronger expansion in profitability, better credit quality and stronger EPS growth than previously expected. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily due to incentive compensation, which we\u2019ll discuss in more detail later. But I'll say upfront that we still expect adjusted non-interest expense to increase slightly from 2017.","Slide 4 highlights two key profitability metrics, return on assets and return on tangible common equity. We have slightly increased the leverage of the balance sheet, but we expect to do more over the next several quarters. Let me take this opportunity to address our return of capital, both in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends as well as our progress on the consolidation of our holding company with and into our bank subsidiary.","As I suspect almost all of you are aware, in May, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law. Later, on July 6, banking regulators issued interagency guidance, which indicated Zions would no longer be part of the CCAR DFAST framework and -- as well as other requirements referred to collectively as enhanced prudential standards, which we are no longer subject to.","Additionally, just last Wednesday, the Financial Stability Oversight Council announced the proposed decision to grant Zions\u2019 appeal for relief from the designation as a systemically important financial institution. Finally, our merger of the Bank Holding Company with and into the bank has been approved by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC. We have yet to hold a shareholder meeting. We expect to announce the date of that meeting shortly.","But once shareholders weigh in and assuming their vote is favorable, these regulatory changes should result in the merger of the holding company in to the bank, combined with these regulatory changes, should result in significantly less duplication of regulatory exams as well as increased flexibility for the board and returning capital to you.","We are particularly pleased with these developments. These, combined with our goal of achieving positive operating leverage, should result in further expansion of our return on tangible common equity. We remain focused on achieving competitive returns on our assets relative to peers.","One of the real highlights of the second quarter of 2018 and really dating back more than a year now is the continued strong improvement in credit quality. On slide 5, you'll see the strong trends depicted on the chart in the right with classified loans declining a particularly strong 31% from the year ago period. Improvement in oil and gas loans accounted for more than 90% of the improvement over the prior year. ","We experienced net credit recoveries of $12 million or 11 basis points of loans annualized. Net charge-offs through the last four quarters were only 3 basis points. We expect that credit recoveries which were $25 million in the quarter will remain a beneficial factor in the remaining months of 2018 and will contribute to what we expect will be a low overall rate of net charge-offs for the full year.","Additionally, as you can see from the allowance ratios, we are still maintaining a strong coverage of non-performing assets and other problem credit metrics. The allowance increased slightly from the prior quarter, entirely due to an adjustment in our qualitative factors to reflect stresses that we can see in the broad economy, such as the discussion and implementation of tariffs and the adverse impacts that can have on certain industries, but that have not yet resulted in visible deterioration of our credit quality measures. Additionally, periodically, we refine our risk rating models and reflected in the second quarter results was a modest increase to the allowance for credit loss from such a refinement. ","The other major theme that has developed over the past three years is strong and relatively consistent growth in pre-provision net revenue as depicted on slide 6. Adjusted for the items listed in the tables in the end of this slide deck or our earnings release, and also adjusting for the larger interest income recoveries, which we characterize as being interest recoveries in excess of $1 million per loan, our pre-provision net revenue increased 7% from the year ago quarter. ","As we've been saying for a while now, the growth rate of 20% plus that we had experienced for a period of time would likely slow because we had harvested the quicker fixes, including deploying cash into securities, consolidating loan and deposit operation centers and some other simplification initiatives. We've said and continue to expect the pre-provision net revenue growth rate to be in the high single digits, without giving consideration to additional interest rate increases by the Federal Open Market Committee. ","We have momentum in several areas of revenue growth, including several areas of lending, such as residential mortgage, owner occupied and municipal lending as well as trust and wealth management and other select areas within fee income. Partially offsetting those items, we've experienced a meaningful slowdown in term commercial real estate lending. As we mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, the market pricing of such loans has tightened meaningfully relative to pricing in 2017. ","We've also seen some erosion of terms and conditions in the marketplace. This combination has given us some pause in aggressively pushing for growth in that portfolio. Stepping back from the details and looking towards the future, we remain comfortable about achieving our loan growth, the growth rate targets in the mid-single digits. Even with what may be relatively stable term commercial real estate balances, we've experienced success in hiring many relationship managers. ","In fact, approximately two-thirds of employees added during the past year have been relationship managers or support staff required to facilitate loan and deposit growth. Although that has a near term effect on expense growth, we are optimistic about the prospects for revenue growth from healthy loan growth.","Slide 7 is a list of our key objectives for 2018 and \u201919 and our commitment to shareholders. We remain focused on simplification as well as growth, which includes balance sheet, revenue, pre-provision net revenue and earnings per share growth. We're committed to continuing to achieve positive operating leverage. We have momentum in many areas of revenue generation and we have an economic tailwind with rising interest rates and strong customer sentiment.","We\u2019re targeting high single digit growth of pre-provision net revenue without the assistance of benchmark interest rate increases. We believe we've built a very strong risk management infrastructure and as such, we expect to reduce the level of volatility and credit quality and overall net charge-offs during the next downturn, whenever that may be. We continue to invest significantly in technology improvements, which includes the substantial overhaul to our core operating systems, but also includes the adoption of many products that we expect will keep Zions competitive and our customers\u2019 information safe. ","We remain committed to further improvement and simplification of our operational processes. Although we have already accomplished a great deal of operational and financial simplification, we believe there is still much we can accomplish, which we believe will result in an improved efficiency ratio, balance sheet profitability and better satisfaction for customers and employees.","In 2015, we indicated that we are going to be targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what could be seen at that time. As I just mentioned, there's still room for improvement, some of which should be achieved as we rightsize our capital structure. But we've also come a long way since 2015.","Regarding returns of capital, we've increased that from approximately 20% of earnings to a ratio of approximately 90% during the past four quarters. We view an increase of balance sheet leverage is appropriate, particularly given the reduction of the risk profile of the company, the decision on the magnitude, timing and form of capital return as a board level decision. Recently, many other CCAR banks revealed the specifics of the capital plans, while in our communication, we opted to give the board the appropriate flexibility to make its decision. However, I'm comfortable in saying that we intend to raise our payout to a greater ratio than in the past and that we recognized the common equity tier 1 ratio on particular needs to move down toward the pure median.","Finally, we remain committed to a community centric banking approach, maintaining the local approach to banking, separate brands, et cetera that have helped us to win awards, such as best bank in Orange County, San Diego County, best bank in Nevada and various others. That are really a reflection of the satisfaction with our customers\u2019 experience and customer profile, which is particularly attractive. ","With that overview, I'll turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review some of the financials in additional detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris and good evening, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll begin slide 8. For the second quarter of 2018, Zions\u2019 net interest income continued to demonstrate growth, relative to the prior year period. Excluding interest recoveries of $16 million a year ago and $1 million in the current quarter, net interest income increased $35 million to $547 million, up approximately 7%. ","With respect to revenue drivers, slide 9 shows our average loan growth of just less than 5%, relative to the year ago period. Average deposits increased slightly from the year ago period and increased 7% annualized from the prior quarter. Thus far, we've been able to achieve this with a relatively modest increase in deposit costs.","Slide 10 depicts year-over-year loan balance growth of about 4% point to point, with the size of the circles on the chart representing the relative size of the portfolio components. This loan growth was adversely impacted by attrition in the term CRE, and national real estate loan portfolios of about $320 million. We experienced consistent growth trends in one to four family, owner occupied and home equity. ","Oil and gas loans have increased modestly, resulting from a relatively strong increase in upstream and midstream loans and a more than $100 million decline in energy services. Municipal loan growth has also continued to be strong during the past year. We've hired a number of staff to help us grow in that area, which is focused on smaller municipalities and essential services of those cities. We've maintained strong credit quality standards and feel comfortable with that growth. ","Commercial real estate, including the construction and term portfolios, declined slightly due to the reasons Harris has already articulated. And in the guidance portion of the slide, we've moved term commercial real estate to generally stable from moderate to strong. We remain comfortable with our loan growth outlook for moderate growth, which is to be interpreted as a mid-single digit annual rate of growth. ","Slide 11 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which increased to 4.57%, of which about 1 basis point is related to interest recoveries. Relative to the prior quarter, the yield on the securities portfolio decreased slightly, largely due to greater prepayments, particularly in our Small Business Administration, loan backed securities. Securities premium amortization in the quarter was $36 million, up from $33 million in the prior quarter. ","The duration of the securities portfolio was 3.5 years at June 30, 2018 and after shocking the portfolio by increasing the yield curve 200 basis points across the curve, there was no material change to the portfolio duration in our models. The cost of total deposits and borrowed funds increased 7 basis points in the quarter to 40 basis point, resulting in a funding beta of about 25%, both for the year-over-year and linked quarter periods. As a reminder, in this case, beta refers to the change in the cost of deposits and borrowings relative to the change in the cost of the federal funds target rate. ","The total year-over-year deposit data was about 14% and was 23% for the linked quarter, as we begin to utilize additional strategies to retain existing and attract new deposit relationships as well as bring deposits on the balance sheet that had previously been swept off into money market and other funds. Cumulatively, since the beginning of the rising rate environment, we've experienced a total deposit beta of 7%. ","We still see good pricing stability and customer growth in the smaller and operational accounts, while larger dollar accounts have been the most sensitive, as one might expect. All of these elements combined to result in a net interest margin of 3.56% for the quarter, which increased 4 basis points from the year ago period. ","However excluding the interest recoveries that we've previously highlighted and the effect of corporate tax reform on fully taxable equivalent revenue and yield, the net interest margin expanded 16 basis points over the year ago period, which reflects a NIM beta of approximately 20% or roughly 5 basis points of net interest margin expansion for each quarter point of benchmark rate increases. We believe this may temper moderately during the next year, as competition for loans and deposits intensify.","Next, a brief review of non-interest income on slide 12. Customer related fees increased 3% over the prior year to $125 million. Several line items experienced a favorable improvement relative to the year ago period, including corporate trust, loan and card fees and capital markets activities.","Non-interest expense on slide 13 increased to $428 million from $405 million in the year ago quarter. However, using our calculated, adjusted non-interest expense, which adjust for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other similar items, non-interest expense increased $22 million to $421 million from $399 million in the year ago period or about 5%. A portion of the increase relates to additional compensation that we announced in conjunction with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which will be paid to most employees making less than $100,000 a year. ","Those items account for about $3 million of the year-over-year increase. As detailed in the press release, about $8 million is attributable to increased salary expense, which reflects annual merit and cost of living adjustments, which are generally reflected in the second quarter of each year and the increase in the number of employees, which Harris explained earlier. Incentive compensation increased $11 million, as a result of improved financial performance and the continued improvement and absolute level of credit quality.","Turning to slide 14, the efficiency ratio was 60.9%, compared to the year ago period of 61%, when excluding the interest recoveries previously detailed. We reiterate our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio below 60% for the full year 2019, excluding the possible benefits of rate increases.","Finally, on slide 15, you see our financial outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the second quarter of 2018. One note, in the interest of simplifying our tax rate disclosure, we're attempting to give an outlook for the tax rate that includes the effects of stock-based compensation. This reduced the effective tax rate by 1.4 percentage points in the second quarter. Our outlook assumes no further option exercises in the second half of the year. In the interest of opening up the line for questions I won't read the rest of the slide to you, but will be happy to take questions regarding our outlook or any other matters.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Sonia, would you please open the line for questions? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","I guess maybe just starting off, in terms of loan growth. Obviously, your 12-month outlook really hasn't changed. It\u2019s still moderately increasing, but just I would love to kind of reconcile that with Harris's comments in the press release and in the presentation just about how things are getting more competitive in CRE? Or obviously, this quarter's loan growth looks like it was a little bit on the weaker side. Like why did it get better? Like, how, just if feels like the underlying trends are getting more negative, but the guidance is not. So I\u2019m just trying to reconcile those pieces.","Scott McLean","Sure, Ken. This is Scott. Harris, why don\u2019t I jump in here and then you jump on top.","Harris Simmons","Yeah. That's fine.","Scott McLean","Okay. Ken, if you would look at slide 19, that might be a helpful way to construct a response. The top panel of slide 19, you can see loan growth by affiliate and by type. And I would just sort of point you over to the far right hand column, the total column and I will address the CRE term comments, but let me just kind of talk about the big picture first. We're not changing our guidance because when you look at that far right hand column, basically C&I and owner occupied, it's kind of $500 million of growth. It's a major component. If you drop down and you see one to four family at about 500 million. ","You combine that with home equity, these are our kind of residential financing activities. And then drop down a little bit further and you see municipal at 500. Those are three really healthy segments. I mean, the whole portfolio is healthy, but three really good pillars for growth. And I would just add to that that energy, as we\u2019ve said about a year ago, at some point, around last quarter, this quarter, we expected energy to start to grow again. It is in fact doing that and so we would see energy contributing. ","And notwithstanding Harris's comment which was a comment about trends in the marketplace and what we're seeing and what everybody else is seeing, we think CRE will grow as well, whether it's C&D or CRE Term. So I think the major components will be the first three I highlighted. C&I and owner occupied, which is basically C&I lending. Our residential finance business, which is one to four family and home equity and thirdly, municipal continuing to be a very strong business for us and I think we're going to see positive contributions from energy and CRE in general. ","So I think that's why we're not seeing -- that's why we're not changing our guidance and it's not unusual also. If you look back over the last three or four years, for us to have a couple of soft quarters in each year, I wish it weren't that way, but that happens to be how we've arrived at our kind of mid-single digit growth over the last three years. ","As for the CRE Term comments that Harris was making, everybody, I think, knows that pricing in that market has gotten more competitive as non-bank lenders are taking more exposure there and terms have gotten a bit more liberal. Having said all that, we\u2019ve been able to create positive momentum in that area in the past, as have we with C&D. So [indiscernible].","Harris Simmons","Can I just add? And the comment and quote was simply to point out what anybody who is going through the numbers would find, which is that CRE is where we've had some drag most notably and explaining the reasons for it. A year ago, we were actually talking about the fact that pricing had expanded there. We were seeing opportunities. It's a tougher market and we're having to be a little choosier on finding deals that makes sense. And so I don't mean to overdo that, but it's -- that's where some drag has been. I'm actually quite encouraged by some of the things we're seeing in, for example, municipal, in owner occupied where we're seeing some good growth. And, so, yeah, I think we're going to be able to get to the targets we established. It\u2019s just not going to come as much from CRE as we'd expected.","Ken Zerbe","And then just as a second follow-up question. In terms of expenses, this quarter's number, whether you look at on a reported or sort of adjusted basis, is this the right level to kind of take on a go forward basis? I mean, obviously, again, your expense -- your guidance do not change or is there certain unusual items that truly will kind of get backed out, not unusual, but just elevated items.","Harris Simmons","Paul, do you want to tackle that?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. Yeah. Ken, I would focus on, if I could, rather than just trying to look at the current quarter, we've identified several items that are impacting our expenses this quarter. But as you correctly point out, we haven't changed our outlook we've provided. And so, we expect to remain along that same trajectory and I would point out as I think pretty consistently what we've been saying is that, largely, our expenses are going to hopefully be in a spot or we intend for those to be in a spot where we are continuing to create positive operating leverage and you\u2019ve seen our revenues grow pretty substantially over the last year. So we are not changing our expense outlook, particularly over the next four quarters, Ken. So I would focus on that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","On the capital deployment side, can you talk to us a little bit more about what the timing and the board decision could be? When is your board meeting and what are some of the considerations there, factoring in here. I know, Harris you mentioned you felt it was prudent to give the board the flexibility there. So what are they considering actually that, in terms of, is it the form or the timing or how can we think about?","Harris Simmons","Well, I think what I\u2019d tell you is, you'll hear more -- they're meeting the end of next week. And so it's -- one of the reasons we didn't want to go, take this out of their hands is because we have a meeting coming up imminently. And we certainly have a proposal for them, while I suspect they will be receptive to it. But from management's perspective, we'd see a continued ramp up in capital distribution. And I think I\u2019d probably kind of leave it there. But more to come very shortly.","John Pancari","Is your board meeting -- is that a typically scheduled board meeting or would it?","Harris Simmons","Yeah. It's a regularly scheduled board meeting. Yes.","John Pancari","And then I\u2019ll let my follow-up also be on the same capital topic, but can you just remind us of what your CET1 target is from a longer term perspective and how do you view that in context of how quickly you\u2019d like to get there. Thanks.","Harris Simmons","Well, I think what we\u2019ve said is, I mean I've said in the past that I'd like to see it just a little north of kind of where the median is. And I do think that as we\u2019ve continued to take risk out of the balance sheet, we really have, getting close to the median is probably about where we would find ourselves generally targeting it. And that could be a little bit of a moving target in zone right. But we\u2019ll have more flexibility now that we have some relief from CCAR and DFAST. We're still absolutely going to use stress testing. ","We actually intend to use it more in a more robust way than we have before in the company in terms of trying to identify where risks and weaknesses are and to make sure that we feel confident about capital targets. But the execution of it should be more flexible than we've seen in the past. We\u2019ll still, quite obviously, be touching base with regulators. We expect obviously -- we expect this merger to be completed, I hope, by the end of the third quarter. And that would mean concurrence from the OCC generally in terms of the direction we're going, but it's -- we expect it to be a little more flexible and quarter-to-quarter to be able to fine tune that a little bit. And so that's at least how I'm thinking about it right now. ","Paul, anything you'd add to that?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. I will reiterate, John, something that Harris said in his prepared remarks and that is that we expect our payout to increase relative to where it has been. And as Harris said, we've got a board meeting here in the next week or so where this will be considered. But it's a very -- this is a very consistent story for us, John. As you know, we think we've got more capital than we need based on our own stress test results. And we have articulated and have been articulating our belief that our capital ratio needs to be pure median plus as we consider the risks in our balance sheet. And the timing to get there will be somewhat flexible, but I certainly like to think that the board would consider a path that gets us there in the kind of the near to medium term. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Paul, two balance sheet questions for you. First, on the right side of the balance here, it looks like you did start to see some of that mix shift into deposits and out of some of the higher cost wholesales funding. Can you help us understand how much of that you saw and how much more of an opportunity that can still be from here?","Paul Burdiss","There was only a little bit of that this quarter and I would measure it in the sort of hundreds of millions and in the context of our balance sheet, it wasn\u2019t a really big change. I think you're talking about the thing that we've been describing previously, which is creating a product that will help to move some of our clients\u2019 off balance sheet money back onto our balance sheet. We've seen a little bit of success there -- a little bit of success there, but it's still a little bit too early to see a really big meaningful impact. Does that answer your question, Ken?","Ken Usdin","Well, do you think it can be a big meaningful impact? And is it the type of thing where you expect that you could see big take-up or is it more of a gradual type of thing?","Paul Burdiss","I think the opportunity, as I think we've previously articulated is kind of in that $1 billion range. But we'll see.","Ken Usdin","And on the asset side, you mentioned the small business securities amortization, can you help us understand the yields in the securities book were down a few basis points, how much of a burden was that on the securities yield and what's just happening in terms of new money coming on versus what's rolling off underneath the surface?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. Overall, these are kind of box card numbers. Overall, the increase in the premium amortization was worth about 8 basis points on the overall securities portfolio yield. And a lot of that came from the SBA portfolio. As a reminder, the SBA portfolio was about $2 billion, generally variable rate that is prime based, but it has a kind of a 10% premium attached to it. So, relatively small changes in that prepayment rate can have fairly large changes in the premium amortization and that's what we saw this quarter. Hopefully, that answers your question.","Ken Usdin","Well, the second part was just, what's the front book, back book doing underneath that. What are you getting new money yields versus what's rolling off, as you're investing today?","Paul Burdiss","Right. The new money yields are clearly greater than -- 50 basis points better than where it is running off and it\u2019s actually better than that.","Ken Usdin","That\u2019s really getting masked by the SBIC stuff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank.","Dave Rochester","Just a quick one on credit. The qualitative adjustment you mentioned, did I hear that was the entire amount of the provision for the quarter? And if so, did that also account for the provision for unfunded commitments as well?","Paul Burdiss","No, there were several adjustments that went into that. That was -- part of it, as you correctly point out, we consider the allowance for credit losses in the aggregate. And so there was the allowance for loan lease losses and then the provision for unfunded lending commitments. But that qualitative piece was just a piece of that, if that's what you're asking.","Dave Rochester","Yes. And any particular areas on which you became more punitive in your models this quarter?","Paul Burdiss","Well, again, on the qualitative piece, was a -- we observed macroeconomic trends. As I think we said in the press release, things for example heightened trade tensions may create stress in the portfolio or as interest rates rise, that may produce some credit stress on our borrowers. So it was things like that and again nothing gigantic, but we're just in an environment where it feels like nothing can go wrong with respect to credit because credit has been so good and improving for so long. Management I think is really trying to understand where the risks are in the portfolio. I understand what those incurred losses are in the portfolio and reserve accordingly.","Dave Rochester","So no particular product type that particularly got hit this time?","Paul Burdiss","The portfolio, kind of, strictly speaking across the board, both geographically and by product continues to perform very, very well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR.","Steve Moss","I want to touch on loan growth here. It was up 5%, but your unfunded commitments were up 10% year-over-year. Wondering what's driving the difference there, whether it's customer sentiment or if it's the way originations are weighted towards municipals or construction?","Scott McLean","This is Scott. The increase in unfunded is primarily related to our construction loan portfolio, which will bode well for fundings over the next couple of quarters. I would not say there was any other real material change.","Steve Moss","And then with regard to CECL, just wondering you have any updated thoughts on CECL and if you have any thoughts as to how it could impact your capital plans down the road.","Paul Burdiss","CECL is a developing topic. I certainly like to think that the work that our team here is kind of second to none in the industry in terms of ensuring that we have the appropriate kind of models and process to be able to develop that. We're not in a position, because of the, I'm sure you're probably pretty familiar with it, but because of the diversity of assumptions required, we are kind of working with regulatory agencies and industry groups to kind of understand and try to triangulate on some assumption sets that make sense in the context of what makes sense for the industry, because we're particularly worried, I'm particularly worried, about the comparability of financial results, after CECL is implemented. This diversity of assumptions is going to make a really big difference across banks. And so our expectation is in 2019, we'll start to see a little more quantitative disclosures around this, but for now, we are paying a lot of attention to it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba","You talked about hiring relationship managers and producers over the last year. If you have this number, how many of those have you hired just in 2018, versus the comparable period last year.","James Abbott","Well, maybe, I'll think that, Jennifer. This is James. One of the things that we looked at was with the revenue growth producers, meaning, relationship managers, deposit folks, treasury management and what we found is that there was a little over 100 new employees that were hired in the affiliates over the last year and about 70% of those were revenue generators or the support staff. And so it's just a very solid mix of a lot of revenue growth opportunities we think in the future from these new individuals.","Scott McLean","Jennifer, this is Scott. I would say, there's some especially new highly experienced additions we've made in key growth markets like Dallas and Denver and those are the two that I would point out.","Jennifer Demba","Was there an outsized amount hired in the second quarter?","Paul Burdiss","It's been an ongoing process, Jennifer, I would say. And so I think some of them \u2013 certainly, some of them came on in the second quarter. We actually did see a bump up in the month of June.","Scott McLean","And Jennifer, the non-relationship manager sort of hires, I would characterize as principally technology related and areas related to our technology, our technology investment priorities and also information security and those kinds of areas. So that's where you would see the increases. We're continuing to find ways to economize in all of our back office activities through our simplification initiatives and so we're very specific about where we're adding people around revenue growth and technology.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson.","Gary Tenner","Just wanted to ask a follow-up just on loan growth, as you were pointing out, Scott, going through the slide 19. Can you talk about just what was happening in C&I ex-oil and gas, both at Zions and Amegy year-over-year and at Amegy particularly, the last quarter as well?","Scott McLean","Yeah. This is on page 19. And I really wouldn't have a specific comment for you. There are ebbs and flows in this and I wouldn't comment about anything necessarily specific about it. So I'm pretty familiar with both and I'm not sure there's a trend we're necessarily seeing that would be especially setting some sort of new path or trajectory. Those are two, as you know, historically strong C&I affiliates for us. So I anticipate that they will continue to be that way. And we look at owner occupied really quite frankly as the same. So in terms of year-over-year, we look at both of those lines as kind of a combined line, doesn't really change your question, but we do look at them together.","Gary Tenner","And even on a sequential quarter basis, at Amegy, if you have a more kind of -- a shorter look back as what happened there over the last quarter. Is that's just some sort of large paydowns and a handful of credits or I mean no conclusions or comments at all?","Scott McLean","We will look into it. We can follow up with you, but my guess is that there were probably several large payoffs.","Harris Simmons","I\u2019ll just add that it can fluctuate -- I mean, the week to week, the number can routinely fluctuate -- just in C&I can fluctuate that kind of $100 million in any given week. And so over the course of the quarter, I mean, you'd hope that you\u2019d see growth, but there is some volatility in that over time.","Gary Tenner","And just as my follow-up, in terms of the pending merger of the holding company into the bank, in terms of cost, I know that there are some efficiencies and you will eliminate some redundancies as it relates to your exams. Are there any actual cost saves out of the gate from that or is it really a question of, sort of moving people's attention to different duties and different things within the bank?","Harris Simmons","It's really -- they are going to be quite modest real cost saves in terms of kind of first order impact. I mean I think where it really comes into play is in just being able to get, some certainty over regulatory interpretations of things, having two regulators looking at the same issues is -- often leads to quite a lot of frustration in terms of just being able to get things done. And so a lot of this is just about regulatory economy and getting to clear answers quickly on any particular issue. ","It doesn't mean that we will always -- I mean, sometimes, I'm sure we'll look back and say, boy, I wish we'd had, maybe, the Fed would have been easier on this or on the OCC. It's not that one is better than the other or anything of that sort. It's just any time you have to two referees calling the same play, sometimes, you get difference of opinion and it can pull things down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to first follow-up on John's questions on capital return. Is there any reason that you guys would need to first resolve the holding company consolidation or should improved capital return happen relatively soon after the board meeting?","Harris Simmons","Yeah. I think I expect we'll see \u2013 as I said earlier, very quickly after the board meeting, some announcements around what we expect and at least in the short term. So, no, the merger isn't something we have to wait for to start creating a little better clarity around capital return.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then just for -- separately on the expense guidance for Paul, how do you define low single digit? Is this like 2 to 3 percentish? And is there an assumption for the elimination of the holding FDIC surcharge in your guidance?","Paul Burdiss","It is 2% to 3% and my expectation is that and hope is that the diff will achieve its target ratio by the end of the year and that we would see some benefit from that.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Is that in your 4Q assumption?","Paul Burdiss","It is.","Steven Alexopoulos","Can you share what that assumption is?","Paul Burdiss","It\u2019s about $7 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","My first question is the flexibility in terms of your liquidity, as you're no longer have to comply with LCR or living will. Paul, if you could remind us what are your HQLA-eligible securities and given Harris\u2019s earlier remarks on balance sheet efficiency and profitability, how you can see the composition of your balance sheet evolve over time as your prudential regulatory structure has already changed?","Paul Burdiss","Erika, I would remind you that the LCR was never really a constraint for us and the reason largely is the composition of our deposits. While we have a lot of commercial deposits, they\u2019re largely operational in nature and therefore received, on a relative basis, kind of favorable treatment under the LCR. Our constraint is and has been actually liquidity stress testing and while the requirement for liquidity stress testing, kind of, the official regulatory requirement under the \u2013 and hence prudential standards is no longer applicable, we find the liquidity stress has to be a very useful management tool, hence reported on a regular basis all the way up to the board. ","So in fact, I would not expect to see a big change in the way we are managing our book. I will say philosophically, the securities portfolio exists first for liquidity and second to manage interest rate risk. That's been true and that's going to continue to be true. So I do not see a change in the composition of that book.","Erika Najarian","And my follow-up question was really on the back of Ken\u2019s line of questioning. If you could give us a sense of the deposits that you were looking to attract back to your balance sheet. How would that -- how is the rate compared to your sources of finding that are available to you today, whether it's, I noticed the time deposits went up quite a bit. There is also obviously wholesale funding. So kind of help us understand at what rate would $1 billion come on.","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. I'm just going to make one real quick, Erika, follow-up on the liquidity conversation. Portfolio composition is going to be driven by changes in the rest of the balance sheet, not by changing the way we manage our liquidity. I just wanted to kind of close the loop on that. As it relates to those kind of alternative vehicles for our client investments, those are going to have a rate, Erika, that is frankly pretty close to market rate, a little better than. We wouldn\u2019t offer it if it weren't profitable to us, but not massively profitable and nothing like we would see from kind of a core money market or a savings account. These are going to be, because they are targeted towards our larger and more sophisticated clients, they're going to have a rate that looks much more like a capital markets rate attached to it. That's true in terms of rate and beta.","Scott McLean","Erika, this is Scott. I would just add to that that I think Paul is absolutely right. It's all going to be accretive, but it really will depend over time as to how successful we are at -- when we bring off balance sheet funds back on, it's going to be very much, as Paul just described it. But our bankers are getting much more agile and adept at attracting large pools of deposits that are not sitting in those money Market type funds. And so, if we are successful there, then we'll obviously create an even more accretive experience than just bringing off balance sheet funds back on the balance sheet.","Paul Burdiss","But the point is, we're paying for the money and we would rather pay our clients than pay others. We are a relationship driven company and we want to make sure that we kind of continue to deepen those relationships everywhere we can.","Scott McLean","That's the main point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","You talked about pressure on pricing structure in Term CRE. Can you give us a bit more detail, both on the structures that you\u2019re seeing in the market that you don't like and you want to stay away from and on the pricing compression that's been taking place, just help us size that?","Michael Morris","This is Michael Morris. I\u2019ll fill that one. We're seeing probably 25, 30 basis points of pricing pressure above and beyond typically where we like to go. We're seeing burnoffs of guarantees sooner during construction and sometimes early in the stabilization period. And I would say those are two of the bigger drivers, maybe a little bit longer ammo here and there on select product types.","Harris Simmons","Geoffrey, as you know, Michael Morris is our Chief Credit Officer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","Paul, I just wanted to go back to deposit costs and I guess kind of the outlook for deposit costs for the next few quarters, as you bring more of these sweep accounts on to the balance sheet and we've got the June rate hike and most likely get a September rate hike.","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. I'm not sure if there will be a June rate hike. September seems likely. The, I would not think of the overall beta of our funding to change and the reason is effectively we are replacing what would otherwise be kind of floating rate wholesale money with kind of floating rate relationship money. So I do not expect the overall deposit beta to change. I mean, where the biggest risk for us and I think we've talked about this previously, the biggest risk for us is not necessarily our deposit rate beta. It's really in migration, particularly migration out of DDA and interest bearing and into interest bearing. ","So that's one of the leading indicators as it relates to that rate sensitivity that we're paying a lot of attention to. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've experienced a kind of an overall funding beta of about 25% in the last quarter and over the last year. And our deposit betas have been lower than that. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s kind of how I\u2019m thinking about it. I think of these -- this is replacing wholesale money with client money with similar sort of rate sensitivity characteristics.","Peter Winter","And then just one follow-up on the commercial real estate loan yields, they were up 25 basis points sequentially. I\u2019m just wondering something unusual was there.","James Abbott","I think the number one thing is the recovery, interest recovery in the prior quarter is the number one driver. Those interest recoveries \u2013 this is James Abbott, those interest recoveries did not recur in the second quarter of \u201918. They were absolutely present in the second quarter of \u201917 and the first quarter of \u201818.","Michael Morris","And then I would say overall, it\u2019s Michael again. Overall, construction gross loan yields are up a bit quarter-over-quarter.","Peter Winter","Would you say this as a good commercial real estate loan yield, going forward continuing?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. I'm trying to think of anything extraordinary that -- so we'll -- tell you what, we\u2019ll do a little deeper dive into that. I can't think of anything that's extraordinary that's occurring in this particular quarter. As Michael said, the composition has changed a little bit as Term CRE has shrank a little bit this quarter and construction was up a little bit this quarter. I think there's a little bit of a composition, loan composition thing that's happening there too, but we'll look at that a little more deeply.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Spahr of Wells Fargo.","Christopher Spahr","Related to the fee income area and other service charges and deposit service charges, kind of lackluster growth, not just this quarter, but actually the past several years and if there's any way we can kind of see any kind of changes in that kind of trajectory.","Scott McLean","Yeah. This is Scott. I think we certainly talk about the individual elements, but customer fees in general were muted this quarter over this quarter last year, muted by about 200 basis points to growth because of an accounting change we made last year. So we're just \u2013 as we're managing the book of fee income, we're right on top of our mid-single digit growth rate.","Christopher Spahr","And then just the derivative of prior questions, the incentive fee or the \u2013 that was paid this quarter related to performance, can you give us some details on what that performance entailed, whether it's on credit quality or financial performance?","Paul Burdiss","Yeah. This is Paul. I\u2019ll start and invite Harris or Scott to jump in. I want to be clear that it wasn\u2019t incentive compensation that was paid this quarter. It\u2019s accrual of incentive compensation over the course of a year. A lot of this was sort of annual compensation and our annual program that is largely predicated on the profitability of the company. So as we tried to say in our prepared remarks, our number one credit quality continues to be very good and in fact better than expectations, but the other is revenue growth. We've had more, I\u2019d say, interest rating and other increases, which have helped us increase overall revenues above and beyond what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. And I think those were the key components of that change.","Harris or Scott, would you like to?","Paul Burdiss","I would just add to that that, as has been noted, we continue to believe that our expense trajectory is on track for full year sort of projection that we -- guidance we've given. And I think the rate of process improvement in the company and there are many projects that add to that, a lot of significant progress in that regard that\u2019s making our company a much simpler place to do business. So all of that kind of hold together is what caused us to enhance the incentive comp line a bit in this quarter.","Harris Simmons","The only thing I'd add is, it's just to remind us all that incentive comp, by its nature, is variable. And so if profitability generally isn\u2019t materializing improvements in it, we would expect to see that the trends flatten in incentive comp. So there's kind of some self-correcting element to it as well.","Operator","We do have a follow-up question from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank.","Dave Rochester","Thanks for taking the follow up. Just a quick one on the adjusted expense guidance. It seems like it actually implied a little bit of a step down in the expense run rate in the back half of the year for you to hit that 3% level on the upper end of your range. So if that FDIC surcharge doesn't come down in 4Q, are there other ways you could still hit that guidance for the year or anything that can get you that $7 million in expense reduction you might need to get there?","Paul Burdiss","I think Harris just talked about one of the key ones.","Harris Simmons","That's really about the biggest lever we've got here, Dave, is \u2013 and I don't say absolutely. It's just a fact -- fact of life is that we \u2013 there are a lot of different kinds of incentives, some of them are very directly tied to specific kinds of production, tempered by credit quality et cetera, et cetera. But a lot of the pool is really driven by kind of just the macro profitability trends and it goes into annual bonuses for senior people, et cetera and that's going to be adjusted with care, but certainly to the extent that we aren\u2019t hitting underlying kind of the trends that we're looking for, certainly, at least a piece of that's going to come out of management.","Paul Burdiss","I was only going to say, in addition to that, there is a lot of kind of current moving underneath the top of the water here as it relates to expenses and I know those of you who follow us all the time and I know you do, know that while we are cutting in places, we are also investing in other places. So there are other levers I believe as it relates to kind of acceleration or decelerating some of the investments that we're making. That can help to manage that overall level of expense.","Scott McLean","This is Scott. I want to add one final thing to punctuate Harris\u2019s comment, he\u2019s not talking in the theoretical. If you look at our last three years\u2019 financial results, you know and you can see that we took incentive compensation down, related to hitting targets that we were very specific about. So we have demonstrated, maybe better than anybody else in the industry, a willingness to do that. So we're serious about it.","Dave Rochester","Looking out to 2019, you do have that 7 million a quarter in extra expense savings, as that ultimately -- surcharge drops off. So are you thinking that this low single digit range is appropriate for next year as well?","Scott McLean","Well, right now, we've provided an outlook for the next four quarters. So that's all sort of a corporate in there, Dave. We\u2019ll get to 2019 when we get there. We don't like to get out too far ahead of our skis.","James Abbott","Sonia, this is James Abbott here. We do have three more questions in queue. We're going to do the best we can to get to them, but if we can ask those of you who are going to ask questions, if we can be quick about them and we will try to be superfast in our responses as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps of Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Brad Milsaps","Hey, guys. You\u2019ve addressed all my questions. I\u2019ll make it easy for you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.","Jon Arfstrom","This should be a quick one. Paul, you talked about trying to get your Tier 1 common to peer levels. Where would you say the peer levels are at today?","Paul Burdiss","Well, we do peer reviews. If you look at our, kind of annual proxy statement, we disclose who we think our peers are. And so if you kind of go that, through that list and calculate a median capital ratio, I think you'll find it in sort of a 10.5% common equity tier 1 range. And as we said, we wouldn't necessarily drill our capital down to that level. We believe over time that at least in the near term, it would be sort of a pure plus kind of level.","Harris Simmons","And I\u2019d also want to just be clear that as -- the exercise isn't just, let's aim for this, for the median. There's a lot of work we're doing behind it. So we, I think what we'd say is that we -- I think we feel pretty comfortable that with the internal stress testing we're doing, et cetera, I think we can feel comfortable at getting to that kind of level. I just want to be clear on the call that that\u2019s not how we go about setting the goal.","Jon Arfstrom","And I know the Zions' way is to be methodical, I know that, but it's a lot of capital to eventually return. And I'm just curious how aggressive you want to be and how aggressive you think you can be.","Harris Simmons","Well, discussion for next week with our board, as I said earlier. We are certainly leaning toward continuing to be more aggressive.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","This quarter, your cash yield is actually approaching your securities yield. And over the last couple of years, you've actually \u2013 you extended the duration of your balance sheet. Is there any desire to maybe shift a little bit to maybe shorten the duration of the balance sheet in order to take advantage of some of the movements or expectations in the short end of the yield curve?","Scott McLean","Well, I'll say that it is a kind of an ongoing part of our ALCO discussion to think about the duration of the securities portfolio. Clearly, as the yield curve flattens, when we embarked on this journey three years ago, we had a lot of cash and the yield curve was relatively steep relatively, certainly compared to now. So, as you go back and do the math, I think you'll see pretty clear that at the time and in the place, we've absolutely made the right decision to maximize that earnings stream and value for shareholders. ","Now that the yield curve is a lot flatter to your point, we actually have been, as we think about buying, we've actually been buying shorter duration stuff. So for example, a year ago, we would have been had probably a heavier mix of 15-year pass throughs and the stuff we're buying today would be shorter and we will continue to look at that duration, again given the shape of the curve and kind of what our duration dollar buys us, if you will. That's clearly something that we need to continue to talk about and we'll continue to talk about it.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to James Abbott for any closing remarks.","James Abbott","Thank you, everyone for joining our call today.

And if you have any further follow-up questions, I\u2019ll be around tonight and throughout the day tomorrow.

You've joined Zions Bancorporation Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James Abbott","Thank you, Latif, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2019 second quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial performance; after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook for the next four quarters. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer and Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer.","Referring to Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with this forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earning release, as well as the supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We'll be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and the earnings call, contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used permanently throughout the disclosures.","A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour. During the Q&A session of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thank you very much, James. We welcome all of you to our call today on our second quarter. I'm going to go to Slide 3 and start there, that's a summary of several key highlights. The results for the quarter were favorable in most areas compared to the year ago results. One of several positive results in the quarter is a robust loan growth we experienced, which was up 7% over the prior year period and up 2% over the first quarter of 2019. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of reasonably strong loan growth, and the second greatest growth for the bank since the recession.","We expect to continue to achieve broad-based loan growth and fee income growth through small business middle market and capital markets activity. Another highlight in the quarter was non-interest expense. Adjusted non-interest expense was up only 1% compared to year ago period and down 2% when compared with the first quarter of 2019. We're continuing to reap the benefits of several years of focusing on efficiency.","We remain highly focused on collecting and implementing simple, easy, fast and safe ideas to improve our business, ideas generally generated largely by our employees. And we continue to improve our operations through lot of these ideas and help limit the growth of operating expenses. However, the quarter also included some challenges most significantly our net interest margin, which was impacted more than we expected due to the sudden downward shift in the yield curve.","Later Paul will discuss this subject in more detail. As published in our slide deck for the company this earnings call, we've reduced our revenue and earnings outlook for the next four quarters to reflect our best estimate of the impact to these macroeconomic changes. However, it's worth emphasizing that our ability to be precise in forecasting net interest income can be quite limited, particularly given how swiftly the rate environment changed.","We are taking steps to blunt the effect of this more difficult rate environment through heightened focus on both interest bearing deposit pricing and non-interest expense control. Specifically with regard to expense control, we expect to maintain non-interest expense in the second half of 2019 that is consistent with the first half of the year.","Slide 4 shows earnings per share results for the last several quarters. In the second quarter of 2019, we reported $0.99 of earnings per share compared to $0.89 per share in the second quarter last year. In the second quarter of 2019, we had about a net $0.02 per share of items that lowered our reported earnings per share. Adjusted for these items, earnings per shares increased 13% over the prior year.","Turning to Slide 5, on left side is adjusted pre-provision net revenue or PPNR, which continued to show growth of approximately 9% over the same period a year ago and 3% growth when compared with the prior quarter, which is somewhat lower expectation, primarily as a result of the interest rate environment. On the right side, we're presenting pre-provision net revenue less current period net charge offs on a per share basis, which increased 10% over the prior year.","As noted, when we introduced this metric when the new loan loss accounting standard goes into effect in 2020, we're concerned and in speaking with you, we believe that many of you are as well that the results across companies will be generally incomparable. Therefore, we present this metric as a simple way to compare across the industry.","For our financial goals, we have long been committed to achieving stronger revenue growth and expense grow, also referred to as positive operating leverage. You can see evidence of that in our results. However, in a period of falling interest rates, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage becomes more difficult. Nevertheless, the message remains the same over the long from horizon. We plan to continue to improve the operating efficiency of the company even as we continue to invest in the business.","Slide 6 shows some of the key technology objectives going forward since the completion of the loan systems conversion. As we announced last quarter, all of the loans that were expected to be on our new system are there, and our attention is now on the deposit side. We're enhancing digital experiences for our customers while simultaneously remaining focused on maintaining a low single digit gross rate in our non-interest expense.","I'll conclude my prepared remarks with Slide 7, which is a list of our key objectives and our commitment to shareholders. Over the long term, we expect to continue to deliver positive operating leverage. In the near term, we expect healthy loan growth, continued fee income growth and solid expense control. As I previously noted, the declining interest rate environmental has limits -- the declining interest rate environment had limits, though it doesn't eliminate our ability to achieve positive operating leverage in the near term.","In years past, we've provided great detail regarding improvement in our credit risk profiles. We expect to be a cost of outlier with superior credit quality in any economic downturn that may develop. Specifically to the second quarter, we experienced a single $8 million charge off, which we don't see as indicative of a more broad-based credit situation. Our net charge-off ratio was just 1 basis points of loan over the last 12 months, and continued to be very acceptable during the second quarter.","We continue to believe we have further room to optimize our capital ratios as supported by our stress testing, which we disclosed on our Web site on June 21st. We've substantially increased the return of capital over the last five quarters, equaling 174% of earnings during the second quarter. The decision on additional capital return is a board level decision and we'll continue to share that information as it becomes available. As we've been saying, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was moving down closer to peer median levels. And we expect to continue to bring that down to just above peer median and maintain it at that level.","With that overview, I'll turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in additional detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good evening everyone. As Harris mentioned, our financial performance this quarter was solid. However, the quickly changing interest rate environment, specifically the inverted yield curve and related expectation for falling short term rates, is creating revenue headwinds, which we are working to manage through.","I'll began on Slide 8, which highlights two measures of profitability, return on assets and return on tangible common equity. As Harris highlighted, we expect to continue to actively manage the areas that we can control, including loan growth, fee income growth, expense control and balance sheet leverage, to improve balance sheet profitability.","On Slide 9, for the second quarter of 2019, Zions' net interest income increased 4% from the prior year period, up $21 million to $569 million. While not at the same year-over-year growth rate as the prior quarter due in parts to reasonably lower short-term interest rates and the inverted curve, much of the growth in net interest income can be contributed to loan growth. The 14 basis point decline in the net interest margin was more than we had anticipated when we spoke in April. I'll describe this in a little more detail later. But at a high level, about half of that decline in the quarter was due to lower loan yields and about half was due to deposit cost and funding mix.","Slide 10 breaks down net interest income by both rate and volume. You can see that our average loans grew 7% over the year ago period. Average loan growth in the second quarter was also strong relative to first quarter, increasing about 9% on an annualized basis. Over the prior year period, yield on loans increased 28 basis points. However, relative to the prior quarter, the yield on loans declined 8 basis points. This is attributable to a couple of dominant factors; first, the recent decline in short-term rates; and secondly, lower rates on new loans relative to maturing loans. This compression could be attributed to several factors, including competitive forces, as well as credit quality differences.","We continue to maintain our discipline on underwriting standards, and have even tightened standards somewhat in select areas as we continue to prepare to be a positive outlier during the next economic downturn. This improvement in portfolio composition embedded in our book has adversely impacted our loan yields overtime. But importantly, has translated too much stronger performance in our stress test results. This has supported a reduction in the amount of common equity supporting the company, therefore, facilitating the repurchase of about 10% of our company's common stock over the past year.","For average total deposits, we are reporting growth of 3% over the prior year period. We experienced a similar 2% annualized growth rate when compared to the first quarter. Although, not shown on this page, average non-interest bearing deposits decreased $550 million or about 2% from the year ago period, which is to be expected during the rising rate environment. We generate deposits through strong relationship banking, which is evident in the continued growth in deposit balances with a relatively modest increase in deposit cost.","While that has been a benefit to us in the past and as we have discussed previously, this also means that it may be more difficult to reduce our cost of deposits as rates decline. When compared to the prior quarter, our cost of total deposits increased 6 basis points with most of this due to exception pricing activity on our strongest relationships. The increase was a little less than the change we reported in the first quarter 2019, and is generally consistent with our expectations and public comments over the past several months.","Slide 11 depicts the key net interest margin components. Our net interest margin was down 14 basis points relative to the first quarter as loan yields reacted relatively quickly to lower interest rates, while customer expectations regarding deposit rates have yet to recognize the lower rate environment. Additionally, our funding mix has become somewhat more weighted toward relatively expensive wholesale funding. While the interest rate environment presents a significant challenge to the net interest margin, we remain focused on profitable balance sheet growth.","Turning to loan growth. Slide 12 depicts the year-over-year period end loan growth by portfolio type with the size of the circles representing the relative size of the portfolio. For nearly all categories, we are reporting solid and consistent growth. Our growth outlook for each portfolio is unchanged and shown here on Slide 12.","Interest rate sensitivity is reported on Slide 13. As we have discussed previously, we have been working for the past year or so to protect net interest income in the event of falling interest rate over the past quarter. Market expectations for the path of short term rates have incorporated multiple rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Hedges are much less effective when falling rates have already been priced into the cost of the hedge. Although, we continue to look for opportunities to decrease our risk to falling interest rates we have paused and swapped at rates that already incorporate multiple rate reductions.","It is important to note that we currently have over $2 billion of interest rate swaps on the books. Also, after quarter end, we increased the notional value of interest rate floors meant to protect against very low rates. We currently have $7 billion of interest rate floors with a strike price of 1%.","Next, a brief review of non-interest income on Slide 14. Customer related fees were up a solid 4% from the year ago period due largely to strength in lending activity and sales of capital markets products. Non-interest expense remains controlled.","As shown on Slide 15, non-interest expense grew less than 1% to $424 million from $421 million in the year ago period. Key drivers of the change were an increase in salary and benefits of about 2%, an increase of all other line items with the exception of FDIC insurance premiums of about 2% and a decline of FDIC insurance premiums of $8 million with the primary contributor being the elimination of the FDIC surcharge. Excluding this change, total non-interest expense increased about 2%.","Looking ahead on non-interest expense, we expect to uphold our focus on expense controls and streamlining bank operations, while investing in technology and people to enable control continued business growth. We are reiterating our expectation for slight non-interest expense growth, which can be interpreted as growth in the low single percentage rate change. Although with headwinds on revenue, in the near-term, we are working even harder to further limit expense growth.","Turning to Slide 16. The efficiency ratio was 59% compared to the year ago period of 60.9%. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio will be below 60% for the full year of 2019.","As seen on Slide 17, credit quality continues to do remarkable with the trailing 12 month net charge-off ratio of only 1 basis point compared to the prior quarter classified loans increased $41 million. The increase is attributable to a few unrelated credits rather than any adverse trend. Oil and gas classified now stand at about 2%, and there is general stability in the other broad categories.","Net charge-offs for the quarter were $14 million, of which about $8 million was related to a single larger credit as mentioned by Harris earlier. While the dollar value has increased, the allowance for loan loss as a percent of loans was slightly lower when compared to the prior year period. The linked quarter increase in the provision for credit losses was largely attributable to these net charge-offs previously mentioned, loan growth and a modest increase in the qualitative portion related to general and economic conditions.","We continue to work toward compliance with the new CECL accounting standard, which will become effective early next year. I expect that Zions will be in a position to disclose more in the coming months, including an estimated financial impact from the adoption of CECL.","Finally, on Slide 18, we depict our financial outlook for the next 12 months relative to second quarter of 2019. We have reduced our outlook for net interest income to stable to slightly decreasing. But I will caution you that net interest income is becoming increasingly difficult to predict in the current rate environment.","Over the past several quarters, we have generally provided net interest income outlooks, which have not incorporated changes in short-term rates. However, due to the recent dramatic changes in the interest rate environment, we are incorporating into our outlook the shape of the current yield curve, which would imply at least 50 basis points of short-term rate decreases by the FOMC. Our net interest income outlook also assumes a modest decline in our securities portfolio balances.","Further down the page and as we have said previously, we will work carefully to manage non-interest expenses to reflect overall revenues. Otherwise, our outlook remains relatively unchanged from that which was reported throughout the second quarter of 2019.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your question please.","John Pancari","On the NIM trend, just given your NII outlook stable to slightly down from here. What does that imply in terms of your net interest margin trajectory? I know you're here at 3.54. How should we think about how that progresses through the back half and then into 2020? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Well, John, I think you know, we're kind of reluctant to provide a lot of specific guidance on the net interest margin, because there are so many things that impact that. So I would rather ask you to focus on net interest income. And again, I'll reiterate that net interest income outlook incorporates the forward curve, which is at least two rate cuts.","John Pancari","And then secondly around the expense commentary, I hear you on the focus of the positive operating leverage. But you indicated that if it gets, in this environment, difficult to achieve that but you remain committed. So could you talk about the magnitude of cost of operating leverage that you believe you can achieve given this tougher backdrop? I know you're digging a lot deeper on expenses. So I want to get an idea, how much leverage we should expect for 2020, for example? Thanks.","Harris Simmons","Well, John, the issue that we have -- the issue that I have personally in creating the outlook is that the -- again, the interest rate environment has changed so quickly. The revenues are just getting a little harder to predict. And so while we do have hedges on the following rates, when the yield inverts and rates fall, revenues get little harder to predict. Now, we've been able to offset a lot of that through balance sheet growth and loan growth in particular, this quarter. So, getting to your question specifically around positive operating leverage, I feel like, we have enough levers internally to manage expenses to reflect the overall revenue environment. And that's what I tried to say in the comments, and I'd stick to that.","Harris Simmons","And I would just add, I guess I'd reiterate what I said in my remarks, which is that I would expect second half expenses to be reasonably flat to the first half. And we think the pass due -- some of this get into the pace at which we're taking around projects, including some technology projects. We have some major technology projects that we're not going to -- change the trajectory on is, it would be really damaging to the long-term success of that to do it.","But there may be some smaller things that we can find ourselves working and delaying. And as always, some of this can be somewhat self-correcting through incentive compensation programs, which are intended to reflect success when we have successes and weakness when there's weakness. So, I have a reasonable amount of confidence through the rest of the year, and we'll have to see as we get there where we are with both interest rates and expenses we go to 2020. But there's a lot of focus on expense control around here right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good afternoon, I should say. Paul, can you elaborate a little bit on just the deposit cost side? You mentioned you're still seeing the price increases and the mix. Total deposit costs, you said were up 6 basis points this quarter. How does that trend from here in terms of what you could see near term? Do you start to see some of that that pressure come off, maybe you can help us understand that trajectory? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, thanks for your question Ken. There're a couple of comments that I'll make. First of all, with an increasing mix in wholesale deposit or wholesale funding, I will note while you didn't specifically asked this. I will note and you saw in our financials, the costs of wholesale borrowings were actually down this quarter. And so while they're expensive overall, on a relative basis, they do react more quickly to market rates. And so, we have seen that. So to the extent rates are falling, I expect the cost of those wholesale borrowing to fall relatively quickly.","Now specifically to your question around customer deposits, my comments were really around expectations. We're really a little bit backward looking. In that, we have continued to see deposit price increases even as short-term rates follow. As you know, one month LIBOR was actually down this quarter relative to the last. And the point that I was trying to make in those prepared remarks was we're in this interesting transitory period where we've got very quick reaction on the loan side to change in the market rates, but the deposit rates haven't quite cut up.","I will say absolutely and unequivocally, we are very focused on deposit cost as it is one of the key levers that we have to manage overall balance sheet profitability. As we have said, this quarter and in previous quarters, much of the deposit cost increase has come through very targeted exception pricing for our clients. And so we are absolutely reviewing that and looking for opportunities to manage that much more tightly.","The other final piece I'll make -- I'll say about deposits is that we have moved some of balance sheet client funds onto our balance sheet, those have shown up in the form of deposits. But those deposits come at a higher rate but are also relatively indexed to overall market rate. And I would expect to see those deposit rates come down as well.","Ken Usdin","And my follow-up to that is then just, as you work on -- work through the exception pricing. I guess, how do you start to get the sense when that price increase has worked its way through? Meaning, how long do you anticipate that lag being between the LIBOR role and then the lag on the deposits and being able to start to roll those lower?","Scott McLean","Kevin, its Scott McLean. Most of -- I think as Paul was trying to indicate, most of the exception price deposits are indexed likely and it's a very large percentage. So it'll adjust pretty quickly, much -- it will adjust pretty quickly.","Ken Usdin","Okay\u2026","Harris Simmons","It's really -- and at the end of the day for larger depositors, it's really the function of competitive conditions. Certainly, much less so for smaller depositors and -- but we continue to see the greatest pressure being with the larger depositors.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Winter of Wedbush Securities. Your question please.","Peter Winter","Commercial real estate, the loan growth has been very strong the last two quarters, and that's an area that you've highlighted that you're being a little bit more cautious on. So I was wondering if you could talk about the growth there.","Scott McLean","Sure. Peter, this is Scott McLean. Thank you for the question. And just a quick comment, we've made pretty much same comment in the first quarter. You are seeing growth in the last couple of quarters there. But if you look at the portfolio over the last two and a half, three years, if you go back to say December of '16, total CRE at that time was $11.3 billion. We sat right in that range, actually a little shy of that at the end of '17, the end of '18.","And so just pick up in '19 is really back just about $400 million or $500 million higher than where we were at the end of '16. So really, we've had this, when most banks our size and smaller, have seen really big increases in CRE and particularly construction, we've been pretty flat. And so -- and there is particular increase in the last quarter, or two quarters, has mainly been construction loans funding that were made, nine months to 12 months ago.","Peter Winter","So is there still room then for that to grow?","Scott McLean","We believe so. In the sense that what we basically said is that we expect our overall loan portfolio to grow mid-single digits, and the CRE portfolio growth would be consistent with that, so that the percentage mix would not change materially. And as you know, about 75% of our CRE portfolio, our $11.8 billion CRE portfolio, is term and 25% construction.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining-Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. I wanted to focus on the quarter, in a sense of reporting $0.99, but there is kind of some unusual things that you really haven't been, I don't think, highlighted quite extensively. One is, you've got the $6 million valuation on the customer swap, which was interesting, that's an unusual situation and then you've got the $8 million sitting over there in the particular loan that went bad, which significantly increased provisioning for this particular quarter. Neither of those sound sustainable. And then you've got $3 million of security losses when interest rates are going down, which you shouldn't really have secured. So, there're really these three transactions that are floating around behind the scenes, which I want to say if you could address, because that represents about $0.08 in EPS when you look at it that?","Paul Burdiss","Marty, this is Paul. I'll provide a little more color. On the credit valuation adjustment, this is related to --we've got our client or the counterparty on interest rate swaps that we sold to them. As the yield curve have flattened and inverted, the value of the swaps to us has increased. That is to say that our clients owe us more on an economic basis with the swaps that we put on.","And so, there is an accounting adjustment where we basically -- we have to adjust to market every quarter that amount. And so the $6 million that you referenced and that we recognize this quarter was related to the change in the valuation of those client swaps. But it's not to be really clear an indication, any indication of a change in the credit quality of those underlying swaps, or underlying customers, is strictly, I would characterize an accounting adjustment related to the increased value of the swaps to us. So, that's number one.","Scott McLean","So, the whole amount just seems to be provisioned for unfunded commitment almost, and then it's -- I mean it's a reserve against something that hasn't happened yet, and that is -- it's certainly not something we are expecting losses more\u2026","Paul Burdiss","No, right and it's clearly a function of the yield curve, the interest rate environment. Number two was the security losses. That was actually related not to our investment portfolio, but to our portfolio of equity investments through our SBIC. And so that's a valuation adjustment. As you've said, it's pretty infrequent. And some quarters are up and some quarters are down. And it just happened to be $2 million. And I apologize the third item was...","Marty Mosby","The $8 million on the loss, on the -- in the one loan\u2026","Paul Burdiss","Yes, the current loss. So as I've attempted to say in my prepared remarks, this was not at all an indicative of any underlying trend. It was sort of a one-off loss that we recognized. At least that's the way I'd characterize it. And so, I think you're right to say that if your question is implying that the $8 million loss was not indicative of a trend of significantly increasing credit cost, I would absolutely agree with that.","Marty Mosby","And then the shift focus completely, the drop in yields on your loans from 4.93 to 4.85 in conjunction with you putting on all these swaps and floors and things that have some costs, although, they are reducing the risk. Is somehow that reflected there? Or is it even in the cost on the depositors? There is some in the costs that happens as you put these derivatives on and some of that's impacting the margin possibly this quarter, because you've been doing so much of that in the last six months.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, not as much in the second quarter. Really the loan yield decline breakdown, as I tried to characterize it, I think we might have it on our slide. It was really -- about half of that was related to the fallen one and three months LIBOR. And then about a half of that was related to, what I would call, the portfolio churn that is the yield of un-coming loans, it was just lower than the yield of loans rolling off. But you're right to the extent we -- certainly, to the extent, if we were to have added a bunch of interest rate swaps at 75 basis points negative carry this quarter, which we didn't do. But have we done that that would have absolutely shown up in the loan yield.","Marty Mosby","But did you have some costs relative to derivatives that is in your margin right now, which is paying insurance that then limits the -- your margins gone up 50 or 60 basis points since rates started rising. You're not going to give all that back, because you've actually reduced your assets sensitivity but it has a cost to it today?","Paul Burdiss","You're right, Marty. I don't have that number on my fingertips but we can certainly get that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","I guess first question is just in terms of loan growth. Obviously, you've had two quarters in a row of pretty strong loan growth. Your guidance is still unchanged, that's moderately increasing. I guess that is mid single digits. But it also implies that loan growth is going to slow, either back half over the next 12 months versus pace that it has been at recently. Is that a fair assessment that loan growth does slow down from here? And if so, why is that the case? Thanks.","Scott McLean","Ken, thank you. This is Scott. As we said before, we run the place on mid single digit loan growth and we think it's going to work in 4% to 5% range and it can work in the 6% to 7%, 7 plus percent range. We're not necessarily guiding to slower loan growth. We've had four really good quarters in a row. Those came off of three moderately black quarters, but we have really solid growth. And as you know -- as you can see, the growth is coming consistent with the mix of the portfolio it's about 50% C&I. CRE, as was noted in the earlier question, is about 25% of our growth right now, but it's coming off of about 2.5 flat years.","And then consumer, our residential mortgage business, both one to four family and home equity, has been very strong, very consistently strong for the last three years. And we're implementing technology there that we think offer us really continued positive outlook on the mortgage side. So no, we're not necessarily guiding lower, I know the words may imply that. But we feel good about our pipeline.","Harris Simmons","I think I'd probably just also say. The second quarter was it was a strong quarter. I mean, I wouldn't want to signal that we think that we\u2019re going to do 9% loan growth here on out. I think it was a strong quarter but it was stronger than what we've seen generally the last few quarters. And I think we're just seeing -- we think the moderate loan growth is still probably what we would anticipate. It's hard to project any of this with precision, that's kind of what it feels like over here.","Ken Zerbe","And then maybe just a question for Paul. Paul, you mentioned that you were tightening, I guess, underwriting factors in certain areas. Can you just explain what areas those were, and where were you and where are you now in terms of how you're thinking about underwriting?","Paul Burdiss","If I could, I'll ask Ed Schreiber, our Chief Risk Officer to respond that.","Ed Schreiber","So the areas that we look at is in -- Scott had talked about the lending that we have in the term real estate where we've really taken a hard look, and we have done actually about 18 months so ago is we've taken a hard look in multifamily and as well as office space. And we've taken a hard look at income producing properties. And given where the cap rates are, et cetera, which is still artificially low, we felt that those markets tend to be a little bit overheated, and we've made steps in there to ensure that we're still getting great equity into our deals, et cetera, and holding to our policy.","Harris Simmons","And I'd add to that. We've reported before that based on what Moody's has put out, our leverage portfolio is less than generally our peers out there, and that portfolio is actually down a little bit year-over-year. So we're not seeing any increases and what is generally perceived as higher risk portfolios.","Scott McLean","I guess the other thing I would add is that really the strongest growth we've been seeing in the last year is in our municipal credit portfolio. And these are credits that - -credit score internally very strong, I mean its good quality business. There're smaller they tend to be smaller credits. And they are -- fundamentally overtime, we've been changing the credit profile on the portfolio in a very positive way.","So it's also -- I mean, it is a factor in the yields, because the growth we've had, these are -- because they're strong credits, you don't get the same margin that you would in a middle market commercial loan. But the economics of them are still very strong. They tend to be very favorably risk weighted in terms of capital, and that's one of the considerations thereto.","Ken Zerbe","Sorry, Scott, just because you brought it up. I didn't see the leverage lending -- your exposure in the slide deck. Do you have that right on hand?","Scott McLean","I don't have it right off hand. Although, I can look for it, it may have been in the deck that we used in Europe. But we can easily get that, it's been in several of our decks.","Harris Simmons","Yes, we'll come back to at the end of the call, and it's down a little bit from where we last reported it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson. Your question please.","Gary Tenner","I wanted to just ask about the rate sensitivity in deposit beta slide. I think you had highlighted 21% total beta data and a 200 basis point cut, or using scenario. So how do you think the betas play out initially if you get 25 or 50? Is there a ramp towards that 21 overtime? Or do you think out of the gate, you're able to cut deposit costs little more aggressively?","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. Just as win rates have gone up, as rates have gone up, there's been a little bit of a ramp effect. My personal expectation is that it would be similar on the way down. However, the difference being that given the rapid change in rates, I would say that we are all really actively monitoring and managing where deposit rates are relative to market rates. So expectation might be for little bit of ramp, but I would say we are managing for a better outcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Your line is open.","Brock Vandervliet","Following on that question, I saw the 8% downward rate shock analyses were down 200. I know that's down from the first quarter. Based on the forward curve, are you comfortable with your positioning? Are there things you would look to add given the opportunity, or based on your view on rates you're comfortable?","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. I am comfortable with our positioning, given what the market is willing to give us right now. That is to say, I'm not willing to put on and I think it's true for the committee, our outlook committee that. We're just not willing to institutionalize 50 to 75 basis points of rate cuts and fully realize those with certainty as opposed to what maybe predicted by the market. Over the course of the last four to five years, I think, we have been working down our asset sensitivity. Five years ago, we were a much more asset sensitive bank.","And I think philosophically, our outlook committee will continue to work down that asset sensitivity over time. So to the extent that the shape of the curve changes and market expectations change and the levels at which we could provide the hedges change, we will continue to be active in hedging the balance sheet. And over time, I would expect that asset sensitivity to decline further.","Brock Vandervliet","And I saw a quick reference to increase in qualitative factors around the provision. I don't think you've touched on that. Was that a material item this quarter? Are you seeing anything new there?","Paul Burdiss","I would say, no. That was just my attempt to provide full color and clarity as it relates to the drivers of the allowance.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay, thanks for the color.","Paul Burdiss","Thank you.","James Abbott","Latif, this is James Abbott here. I just wanted to answer a question from earlier on the leverage lending. It's about $1.2 billion of leverage loans per the FDIC's definition of what leveraged loan is.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.","Kevin Barker","I just want to follow up on the operating leverage question earlier, and some of your guidance around keeping non-interest expense in line with revenue. Are you saying that you're going to sustain the expense base in-line with your revenue no matter what the revenue looks like? Or are you willing to even tweak that depending on the revenue outlook?","Scott McLean","What I was trying to say, this is Scott. What I was trying to say was that we recognize that the revenue outlook has become a little less predictable as the rate environment has changed, or changed very rapidly. And so we are really focused organizationally on managing our expenses to reflect that revenue environment. So that is to say, to the extent revenue does weaken then we will absolutely go back and take a look at expenses and see where we can manage those more tightly.","Kevin Barker","And then when you think about the opportunities on the expense side. Where do you see areas where you could cut expenses, whether it's branch count, back office, or decreasing investment and some of the things that you see out there today?","Scott McLean","This is Scott. I would just comment -- Harris mentioned we do have a lot of projects underway. The one big technology project we're not inclined to slow our spend right there, because we're on a path to install our new deposit system in about two and a half years. But there is a portfolio of other projects that we could slow down a bit that have a current P&L impact. And then there's just a variety, just this simple, easy, fast, safe collection of projects that are going on. There's just a big bucket full of smaller expense opportunities that we're working on at any point in time. And then finally, incentive comp is certainly a factor, as Harris noted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Moss of B. Riley FBR. Your question please.","Steve Moss","Just wondering here with the increase in wholesale funding. How much higher do you expect it will go if loan growth remains strong? Or will you use securities perhaps to fund some of your loan growth? And then also just one related thing there. What were your yields on loans for the quarter?","Paul Burdiss","As it relates to the wholesale funds, obviously, that's a function of loan and deposit growth. In most recent quarter, clearly, we saw loan growth exceeding deposit growth. But we organizationally, I'd say over the last couple years, have really changed the way we are approaching the market with respect to garnering deposits. And so, I remain hopeful that we'll be able to maintain some level of deposit growth that will support that loan growth. And therefore, the reliance on wholesale funding would be also limited.","As it relates to securities portfolio, as I said in my prepared remarks or maybe as in the outlook slide, my expectation is that we could continue to see a modest decline in securities portfolio that will be helpful, as it relates to funding loan growth. James usually has at his fingertips the oncoming loan yield. I do not have that on top of my head. So James, if you have it, great. And if not, we'll get back to you.","James Abbott","I would -- we do have it, but it's not -- the way I would probably best describe it is this. Over the last two to three quarters, we've seen a shift from where the back book loans that were maturing and rolling off. And the front book, the new loans that are coming on has moved from being neutral to somewhat negative, meaning that the old loans rolling off are at a higher yield than the new loans coming on.","And part of that is what Harris mentioned with the municipal loans. We're putting on a decent portion of municipal loans, residential mortgage loans. All of those have lower loan yields than where they have been in the past. And so at the end of the day, I can give you the exact number but it's -- what's more important is that difference between the front book and back book. And I would say that's in the 15 basis points area, and it has been for the last couple of quarters in that area.","Steve Moss","And then just wondering any updated thoughts on capital targets here? And if maybe some of the signs, just slowing economy are having \u2013 are impacting your capital thoughts?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I'll start and others can join in. We repurchased $275 million in the second quarter. You saw that consistent with I think the pace that we've been on for the last several quarters. As Harris said in his remarks, we set forth probably now -- a good 12 month ago, we set forth a target to be at peer median, or peer median plus as it relates to the common equity Tier 1 ratio. And there hasn't -- we haven't seen anything that has taken us off pace to achieve that.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your question please.","David Long","Could you guys provide additional detail on that $8 million credit that charged-off, maybe what industry or what geography that was located in?","Paul Burdiss","We did not. I didn't think it was big enough to call out that sort of details. Other than to say that we do not believe that was related to any other underlying trend in the portfolio.","David Long","And maybe I'm jumping the gun here a bit on CECL, it sounds like you'll give some color may be next quarter. But at this point, has the implications of CECL impacted your appetite to originate loans in any specific categories?","Paul Burdiss","Not at this point. But we do think that that's one of the perverse ramifications of CECL potentially down the road. But at this point, no.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to James Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?","James Abbott","Thank you everyone for joining the call today. We appreciate your attendance, and we appreciate all the questions. If there are further questions, we are happy to take them. I'll be around throughout the evening and throughout the rest of the week.","So thank you for your time, and we'll see you again shortly. Have a good night.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"23265":["Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call January 22, 2018  5:30 PM ET","Executives","James Abbott - Director of Investor Relations","Harris Simmons - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Paul Burdiss - Chief Financial Officer","Scott McLean - President and Chief Operating Officer","Ed Schreiber - Chief Risk Officer","Analysts","Kevin Barker - Piper Jaffray","Steve Moss - B.

And thank you for your patience. You joined Zions Bancorporation's Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James Abbott","Thanks Latif, appreciate it. And I would clarify that the conference call is being recorded. And good evening to all of you. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2017 fourth quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives. After which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook for the next four quarters.","Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; and other Zions executives who are available to address your questions during the question-and-answer session.","I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although, actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made during this call. A copy of the full earnings release, as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and this earnings call, contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services' analysts. Certain of these non-GAAP measures are key inputs into Zions' management compensation and are used in strategic goals that have been and may continue to be articulated to investors. Therefore, the use of such non-GAAP measures, are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.","We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour. During the question-and-answer session of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thank you, James. And we welcome all of you to our call today to talk about our fourth quarter and full year results. I am going to go through a few of the slides, beginning with the deck we\u2019ve provided to you. On slide three are some highlights for the quarter.","At a high level, we were really pleased with the performance of both quarter and the year. We established some very specific financial targets back in early 2015 that included some goals for 2017. We achieved those goals and today the Company is substantially more profitable. We eliminated considerable amount of inefficiency, and we've transformed a lot of our operations to be simpler and easier for both our employees and customers. But we are not finished. Our culture of identifying ways to simplify and streamline is firmly established around the company, and we plan to deliver continuous improvement in operational and financial efficiency in quarters and years to come, while investing in areas that we expect should result in a healthy rate of revenue and earnings growth.","Looking specifically at the quarter, we experienced continued strong growth in earnings per share, up about 33% from the year ago period, if adjusted to exclude a couple of items that were directly related to the change in the federal tax law. We were pleased with loan growth, which increased 5% over the year ago period, which compares to about 2.2% for large domestic commercial banks. We were able to push the efficiency ratio down to 61.6%. But is excluding the larger charitable contribution that we detail on slide three, it would have been actually just under 60% for the quarter.","For the full year, efficiency ratio was 61.7%. Again, is excluding the larger charitable contribution and the expense associated with the Hurricane Harvey, which we detailed last quarter.","A quick note about the contribution, the charitable contribution. We contribute several million dollars per year as part of our contribution to our communities. And we expect to make additional contributions in 2018 and beyond, outside of this unusually large contribution. And this large contribution and fourth quarter will displace some of the expenditures that we would otherwise be making in 2018 in succeeding year. So we\u2019ll be doing portions through our income statement and a portion through the foundation. But in combination, we don\u2019t expect to be ramping up our charitable contribution spending, we simply front-end loaded some of that back into 2017.","We remained disciplined with the pricing of funding. Our so called deposit beta or the increase in the cost of deposits expressed as a percentage of the increase and the cost of federal funds rate, was only 3% during the quarter. And our funding beta, which includes the cost of borrowings, was 14%; the combination of those two factors led to healthy increase in sustainable net interest income, up approximately 10% over the prior year fourth quarter.","With regard to credit quality, we've remained pleased with continued strong improvement, including a 9% linked quarter decline in classified loans and 12% linked quarter decline in non-performing assets, including loans that are 90 days or more past due, and only 11 basis points of annualized net charge-offs.","Loans outside of the oil and gas loan portfolio experienced another remarkably good year with only two 100s of a percent or 2 basis points of loan losses as a percentage of average loans if you exclude the single commercial credit that was subject to a department of justice investigation in the first quarter, or 9 basis points if you include that credit.","On slide four, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue reflect steady improvement, up 19% from the year-ago quarter. And it's a previously referenced larger charitable contributions excluded pretax pre-provision net revenue, increased 25% from a year-ago quarter. Some of the growth is due to the benefits of securities purchases, which we do not expect to be as significant contributor to growth over the foreseeable future. However, we do expect continued moderate loan growth and customer related fee income growth, combined with continued expense discipline, which should contribute to further positive operating leverage. And if the Federal Open Market Committee continues to raise the federal funds rate, we would expect further improvement in our pretax pre-provision net revenue. Although, that benefit is not included in our guidance or outlook.","As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, the rate of growth seems likely the slow. Although, we still expect the strong rate of growth.","Turning to slide five, I've already highlighted the efficiency ratio in my earlier comments. But visually, this represents all the work we've done since 2014 to improve the profitability of the Company. We expect to push to achieve an efficiency ratio below 60% for the full year 2019, excluding the possible benefits of rate increases.","Slide six depicts two key profitability metrics, return on assets and return on tangible common equity. Return on assets was 74 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 88 basis points a year ago. However, excluding the larger charitable contribution and revaluation of the deferred tax asset, return on assets increased to 1.07%. Return on tangible common equity was 7.4%, but again excluding those two items, it would have been approximately 10.9%. We\u2019re encouraged by the continued improvement and remained focused on achieving competitive returns on our assets relative to peers.","Moving to slide seven. We experienced 5% year-over-year growth in loans held for investment despite continued attrition in the national real estate portfolio, as well as the term commercial real estate, the oil and gas portfolios. All told attrition was about $550 million or more than a percent of loan growth. ","We are comfortable with our loan concentrations. The economy is generally strong. We're optimistic that the new tax policy will be helpful to generate growth and we made some improvements in origination process, all of which should contribute to continued moderate loan growth.","Deposits declined slightly, about 1% over the past year, which is almost entirely due to large dollar deposits rather than middle market or small business to personal accounts. Loan growth outpaced deposit growth over the past year by $2.7 billion, which we funded with incremental wholesale borrowings. We expect to remain disciplined around deposit pricing. We've experienced some pressure on larger dollar deposits, but the majority of our deposits are smaller accounts, both for personal and for business accounts. And therefore, not likely to be as price sensitive in our opinion, as the larger deposit customers are.","We sweep several billion of customer funds off the balance sheet to asset managers over the course of next few months and quarters, we expect that some of that will return to our balance sheet should be source of funding for earning asset growth.","With that overview, I'll turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in additional detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good evening, everyone. I'll begin on slide eight. For the fourth quarter of 2017, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Here is detail of the couple of key items, so I won\u2019t repeat them here. I will add that we are pleased with the financial performance of 2017, and note that we've successfully delivered on our financial commitment made to you on June 1, 2015.","Let me make a few comments about revenue. Nearly 80% of our revenue comes from net interest income. Slide nine depicts the recent trend in net interest income, which continue to demonstrate substantial growth in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year period. Net interest income increased $46 million or nearly 10%. Interest income increased approximately $60 million, of which approximately two-thirds came from loans and one-third resulted from the investment portfolio.","With respect to revenue drivers, I'll discuss earning asset volume first then transition to rates. Although, we don't have a slide on this, as we discussed in the recent past, we do not expect investment portfolio growth, which has been a meaningful contributor to pre-provision net revenue growth over the past several years to contribute significantly to growth in net interest income. The investment portfolio has now grown to the appropriate size relative to the size of our balance sheet.","Slide 10 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year ago period. The size of the circles represent the relative size of the loan portfolios and the circles are ordered by size, left to right, from smallest to largest portfolios respectively. Total loan growth, including the effects of the declining oil and gas portfolio and the national real estate loan portfolio, was 5%. The key take away from this chart is relatively balanced growth across the loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial owner occupied and home equity loans all increased in the mid single digit range, while we experienced strong growth in one to four family and municipal loans.","We experienced general stability in construction and land development and term commercial real estate loans. As expected, we experienced declines in oil and gas loans and national real estate loans.","Shown at the bottom right is our expectation for loan growth by product type. We are comfortable with our commercial real estate concentrations and plan to grow commercial real estate loans at rates which are generally consistent with the overall mid single digit loan growth rates.","We expect oil and gas loans to stabilize or possibly increase somewhat. And although, we don't expect national real estate portfolio to increase in 2018, we do expect the decline to be relatively minimal compared to prior years.","Slide 11 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. The top line is loan yield, which increased three basis points from the prior quarter to 4.30%, and increased 11 basis points over the year ago period. Meanwhile, relative to the year ago quarter, we experienced about two basis points of deal headwind due to reduced benefit from loans purchased from the FDIC.","New loan production for the fourth quarter was up two basis points higher than the yield on our portfolio. Without future rate hikes, we expect the yield on the loan portfolio to remain generally stable from the current level. Favorable factors include the December rate hike and new loan production, while adverse factors include the tax effect on municipal loans and income from loans purchased from the FDIC back in 2009.","Harris touched on our deposit and funding costs earlier. But to expand a bit on his comments, the average cost of total deposit increased to 13 basis points from 10 basis points a year ago. During which time, the average federal funds rate has increased 75 basis points, or a so called deposit beta of about 4%. Interest expense, which includes both deposits and borrowings expressed as a percentage of total deposits and borrowings rose 26 basis points from 15 basis points or a 14% funding beta.","Reflected in the lower left is the change in the mix of earning assets. As a result of this mix shift, we experienced about 3 basis points of margin headwind during the past year due to 2 percentage point lower concentration of loans relative to earning assets.","The security deal declined slightly. This was primarily due to higher premium amortization on the SBA or small business association loans, administration securities. For those of you who have followed the Company for some time, you've heard us discuss that the SBA securities have a high premium relatively associated with them; and that as the economy improves, we would expect a higher rate of premium amortization due to higher prepayments, which did occur during this past quarter.","More broadly, we have been reinvesting cash flow from our investment portfolio into securities with a marginally higher yield than the average portfolio yield. Therefore, all else equal, we would expect yield and securities portfolio to increase slightly over the longer term.","On the right side of the page is a table depicting the percentage of loans that have a shorter term, medium term and longer term interest rate reset base. We have detailed the effective interest rate swaps and floors on the loan portfolio so that you may better understand the possible reaction and timing of yield on the loan portfolio to rising short term rates versus rising longer term rates.","Overall, our net interest margin should be relatively stable in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the fourth quarter as we expect some benefit from the December 2017 increase and the Fed funds target rate to help. However, this will be offset by the effect of tax reform and its impact on the municipal loan and securities portfolio yield, which we estimate to be about 3 basis points of headwind to net interest margin.","On slide 12, we show the model effect on net interest income in a rate environment that is 200 basis points immediately higher across the curve relative to the current level. This would generate 5% increase in net interest income, which assumes a 36% deposit beta.","On the right shows the comparison of this rate rising environment versus the last time we experienced that tightening where the beginning of the ten lines on a quarter immediately before the Fed began to raise rates. For Zions, deposits have been less sensitive so far this cycle as compared to the last, up only 3 basis points relative to the 150 basis points move by the Federal Reserve, as compared to about 25 basis points of higher deposit costs at a comparable point in the prior cycle for a similar move by the Federal Reserve.","We have a very granular deposit base with a very high ratio of small balance accounts from small and medium sized businesses and a very granular portfolio of consumer deposits. We expect that the increase in our cost of deposits may remain low for the near term.","Turning to slide 13 and non-interest income. Total non-interest income was $139 million, up from $128 million a year ago. Beginning with customer related fees shown on this slide, we experienced a 9% increase to $127 million from $118 million a year ago. Most lines experienced a favorable improvement relative to the year ago period. Treasury management fees, which are included in deposit service charges, increased about 6% from a year ago period with card and loan fees increasing each about 4%.","However, retail deposit service charges declined slightly due in part to lower non-sufficient funds and overdraft fees. We've experienced strong performance in wealth management, which includes trust businesses and certain capital markets products.","Non-interest expense on slide 14 increased to $417 million from $404 million in the year ago quarter. If adjusted for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other similar items, non-interest expense increased to $450 million from $395 million in the year-ago period. Furthermore, if one excludes the $12 million incremental contribution for the charitable foundation, as Harris discussed, the adjusted non-interest expense would have been up by only about 2% from the year ago period.","A few notable points; salaries and employee benefits increased $13 million from the year ago period; this is mostly explained by the substantial improvement in profitability this year versus the last year; and this results in higher profit sharing and incentive compensation pay to employees; relative to the prior quarter, occupancy declined about $6 million; you may recall in the third quarter of 2017, we accrued for estimated property damage associated with Hurricane Harvey in Houston; and as mentioned in the press release, other non-interest expense increased from the prior quarter and year ago quarter due to the larger contribution to the charitable foundation.","Slide 15 depicts the overall credit quality metrics of our loan portfolio. Harris provided some high level comments earlier, and so I will echo his remarks. We are encouraged with the meaningful improvement in classified loan, non-performing assets and net charge-offs. Much of the improvement came from the oil and gas portfolio and we remain optimistic that we will continue to see further favorable changes due to oil and gas credit measures. Although, not shown in this slide, we have materially and substantially improved the weighted average risk rate on both the commercial real-estate and the commercial loan portfolios during the past five years. And we remain disciplined on our commercial and on our consumer loan underwriting criteria. As such, we expect the manageable credit costs, while much of the provision for credit losses will cover these incremental loan growth.","Slide 16 is a visual representation of the former tax structure with the federal statutory rate of 35% and our state's statutory rate of about 4.8% pretax or about 3% after tax. And this is presented alongside on our effective tax rate. And the third bar for 2017 excludes items such as the expense associated with the revaluation of the deferred tax assets taken in the fourth quarter and benefits to state tax expense in the first half of the year and reduced tax expenses due to the exercise investing of stock based compensation, which is known as ASU 2016-09.","On the right side is a representation of what we expect will be the statutory and effective tax rate for 2018 and beyond, with one important caveat. Some of the states in which we do business maybe evaluating their tax structure in reaction to the change in the federal tax law. And thus, we may experience a change to the state tax rate. Nonetheless, we feel comfortable giving an outlook that the 2018 effective tax rate is likely to be between 24% and 25%.","On slide 17 is a list of our key objectives for 2018 and 2019 and our commitment to shareholders. We are fully committed to continuing to achieve positive operating leverage. We have three years behind us in our effort to materially improve profitability and grow earnings. We remain committed to further improvement and simplification of our operational processes. We expect to continue to experience improvement in the efficiency ratio and that pre-provision net revenue will increase at a rate in the high single-digits.","This outlook assumes the impact from the change in the tax law on municipal loans and securities and at the higher salaries and bonuses paid to many of our employees. And also contemplates the effect of the December 2017 increase and the Fed funds rate. Although, it does not assume any further increases in net or other benchmark interest rates.","We expect to continue to invest significantly in technology improvements, which includes the substantial overhaul to our core systems. Back in 2015, we indicated that we are going to be targeting much more substantial returns on capital that could be seen then and we are tracking well towards those goals, although there is still room for improvement.","Regarding returns of capital, we have increased that amount to a level above the peer median and we view a moderate increase of balance sheet leverage as appropriate, particularly given the reduction of the risk profile of the company. Unless it is often enquire as to the appropriate level of capital and we have responded that the stress testing results are the primary driver and you can see our company run media stress test result on our Web site.","But to highlight a single number, our post stress common equity tier one ratio was 9.9%, and well above the 4.5% minimum regulatory threshold. A second consideration is where we rank within our peer group. For various reasons, we believe it is important to remain somewhat stronger than the peer median with respect to capital. We recognize that the peer median is likely to decline over time. And so while the peer-median analysis is a relative threshold for us, the stress test is an absolute threshold.","Now moving to slide 18 and our outlook. We are maintaining an outlook for loan growth at moderately increasing, which is to be interpreted as an annual growth in the mid-single digits. We expect net interest income to increase moderately over the next 12 months. We assume no additional rate hikes in this outlook. Although, we do incorporate into our view, the December 2017 rate hike. Additional increases in short-term rates are expected to improve net interest income.","We posted a net provision for credit loss, which includes both funded and unfunded commitments of minus $12 million in the fourth quarter. Asset quality continued to outperform our expectations and that credit costs have been lower than expected, a trend which may continue. However, our base case scenario calls for a modest provision for credit losses over the next several quarters that is greater than zero. In other words, we may experience reserve release as credit quality continues to improve, which may be offset by reserves for new loans and off course ongoing net charge offs.","Customer-related fees, we expect, which are defined in our press release and exclude dividend income and securities gains and losses, should increase slightly from the level reported in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, fee income remains the key focus for the company. Although, the outlook recognized is that the fourth quarter 2017 level was relatively strong.","Excluding the effect of the $12 million contribution to the Company's charitable foundation, we expect adjusted non-interest expense for 2017 to be slightly higher than the 2017 level. To be clear as shown on page 21 of the earnings release, adjusted non-interest expense was $1.640 billion, less the $12 million contribution, one would arrive at a base rate of $1.628 billion. From which we would expect an increase in the low single digit rate of growth for the full year 2018.","Excluding stock based compensation, the effective tax rate for full year 2018 is expected to be between 24% and 25% as stated earlier. Preferred dividends are expected to be approximately $34 million over the next four quarters, and diluted shares may fluctuate due to both share repurchases and the dilutive effect from the outstanding warrants. The dilutive effect of the warrants is predominantly dependent upon the future price of the stock. You may see in the appendix further sensitivities on the effected warrants on diluted shares outstanding.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Latif, would you please open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kevin Barker, Piper Jaffray. Your question please.","Kevin Barker","You made a quick comment about the securities yield bouncing back higher. Could you walk through that again and some of the reasons why you're starting to see securities yields go back up given we saw quite a bit of decline in the fourth quarter?","Paul Burdiss","The decline in the fourth quarter was really related to prepayments we're experiencing on our SBA securities. And as noted in my prepared remarks and as you know, those have a relatively high premium attached to them. So relatively minor changes in prepayments can lead to, I will say relative to the other types of securities, disproportionate changes in yield. So all other things equal, the point that I was trying to make was that the securities that we're buying today actually have a higher yield than the securities that are coming off.","And so over time, my point was again with similar duration and extension risk kind of characteristics, the yield on the securities that we're buying today have a higher yield than the yield the securities are coming off. And so therefore over time, again all other things equal, we would expect the securities portfolio yield to creep up over time.","Kevin Barker","And then also in your guidance for fee income, I noticed you're seeing slightly increasing for customer facing fees. Now, fee income as a whole, has been growing at roughly a 5% clip over the last couple of years. Was there a reason why you're seeing maybe a slight decline there? Or is it just related to the customer fees, in particular.","Paul Burdiss","Well, the item there was really related to core fees. And as I tried to say in my prepared comments, the fourth quarter came in pretty strong. And so because specifically that page is a fourth quarter to fourth quarter view, that's really I think what that comment reflects. I will say over time, we are clearly continued to target mid single digit growth in our core fee income.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss of B. Riley. Your line is open.","Steve Moss","I was wondering, you just discussed that commercial real estate growth we saw this quarter. Where are you seeing that from here?","Harris Simmons","Could you repeat that?","Scott McLean","Commercial real estate growth this quarter\u2026","Harris Simmons","Where you see it going from here you're saying?","Steve Moss","Where you seeing it from here, where are you seeing those sources of growth and where do you know -- or should we expect similar trends in the future here?","Scott McLean","This is Scott McLean. I would just say that the portfolio, commercial real estate portfolio in general last year declined as you can see. But we did start to see a pick-up in the fourth quarter and we anticipate growth that should be consistent with the rest of the portfolio throughout 2018. And really we're seeing it across the franchise. And it\u2019s predominantly CRE term as opposed to construction, which is consistent with the mix of our portfolio currently.","Steve Moss","And if we were to get another rate hike in March, what would you expect the benefit to the margins to be?","Scott McLean","Well, we provide a lot of disclosures around this. So that I can't answer that so that I don't have to answer that question directly, because the answer is because of the effect on the margin is dependent somewhat on also the shape of the curve. And so you can see on the slides that I referenced -- we\u2019ve got about, if I remember right, 40% of our loans in the near term are impacted by the change in rate. Obviously, changes in deposit rates are going to be heavily influenced on the change in the net interest margin. So all that together net-net, you're looking at probably a couple of basis points improvement in the margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Brad Milsaps","Harris, I was just curious in 2015 you guys laid out the multiyear efficiency goals, and now it's kind of the primary targets for management and kind of how your incentives are structured. Just kind of curious obviously you still have those efficiency targets out there in the out years [indiscernible], what else is kind of the big driver for you guys? And as a follow-up to that, you've commented in the past that given where rates have been and the amount of capital banks that had have to hold maybe the old measures of returns for banks shouldn't apply anymore. Just kind of curious now what you might be thinking about kind of returns for the industry you guys are now above 1% ROA, still have a lot of capital, but just any additional color in that regard would be helpful?","Harris Simmons","Sure. Well, I think in terms of the kind of measures that we're going to be looking at, and I think when we -- if you go back two to three years ago, we -- it was important to focus on something like efficiency ratio. We were way out of the middle to third way in terms of where we should have been probably in -- we've made a lot of progress as we've demonstrated in \u2013 we\u2019ve shown some of the slides here. I think as we get little closer to where the industry is, our focus internally is very much on continuing to work at reducing costs, making -- really making everything we do as efficient as we possibly can.","I expect that in terms of the efficiency ratio, we will in 2018 see incremental improvement over 2017. It will be at a slower pace as you can -- the obvious. We can't continue the same kind of trend that we earlier -- the same of pace of improvement, but we'll see further improvement. I am quite confident. And internally I think our focus is shifting more towards, how can we grow pretax pre-provision net revenue, which I expect that growth rate to be in the high single digits, somewhere thereabouts. And it's a focus on operating leverage and growth of PPNR, and we're working on a lot of internal initiatives that I think will help us continue the trajectory that we've been on. And again not at same pace we \u2013 there was a lot of low hanging fruit and that becomes tougher as time goes on, but there's still a lot of opportunity.","As far as capital goes, as Paul mentioned, we've continued to ramp up the payout. And when we announced the merger -- our intent to merge the holding company into the bank, it triggered some questions from some investors as to whether that was going to create a sort of a one-time major adjustment in capital. And we I think communicated to everybody that wasn't our intent. It's really continued to work towards rightsizing capital in a disciplined and orderly way. And certainly looking at what's happening in terms of the economic environment and what's happening to capital levels in the industry generally.","And with the focus on our own risk profile, I do expect that it will be more focused on our own stress test results that will be a big driver, and we are doing a lot of things internally to produce this sort of - to incorporate those results into how we incentivize structure and pricing and other things and like I expect it will be really good for shareholders. We want to be sure that out on the frontlines that everybody's incentives are aligned in terms of trying to create the best possible structure that protects the bank while also providing pricing that generates adequate return.","So I guess I'm giving a little just a window into how we are thinking about it, we don\u2019t have any specific goals that we are going to communicate today in terms of what's going to happen our capital levels except that I expect that will continue kind of right size as the balance sheet grows and we continue to pay out capital at somewhat accelerated pace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Paul, I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of expense growth. First I guess how would you define low single, you help us kind of understand the ranges for the mid you were talking about, but in terms of off of that 16 to 28 days? How would you just help us understand what you consider low single?","Paul Burdiss","Ken, we are publicly not super specific there; however, if you and kind of open up the Zions Bancorp or another story, you can see the last year we used a similar return where we are talking about slightly increase and you may recall that expenses increased kind of depending higher measuring it kind of 2% to 3% once you factor in that charitable contribution we discussed. So Ken I'd say it's kind of the net ballpark hopefully that's helpful.","Ken Usdin","Yes, and in that 2% to 3% issuing a ballpark. I guess how are you weighing just ongoing programs in terms of the tax spend and then anything incremental on top of what you did in the fourth quarter? And do you have any thought about do you accelerate some of the tech projects? Or do you just keep everything on that long-term seven year plan than you\u2019ve had it on for a long while?","Scott McLean","Ken, it's Scott McLean. Let me respond to that part of it. When you look at the expense growth which Paul has just described qualitatively, you described a bit more quantitatively. We -- there are lot of moving parts, we are finding ways to save money all the time based on our simplification initiatives and Harris described, but clearly employment cost is primary driver of the number. And I would just say that we are adding bankers and growth areas particularly number of our strong fee income areas like municipal finance, mortgage, wealth and just to mention a few.","So, we are adding bankers in our faster growing and fee income areas and we are adding just basic commercial bankers and small business bankers across the franchise so that would be the primary driver there and then the secondary driver would be on a technology cost as you noted and our future core project the replacement of our long systems it's very long system, our three long systems and two deposit systems.","It's just one of numerous technology projects its probably been the one we talked about most but we're quite spending 20% to 25% of our tax spend this year on advancing our digital capabilities and so there is technology in general is a fundamental driver of the expense number as well. And I would say the comparative 5 or 6 years ago, the investments we're making on the technology side are much more offensive and forward leaning, we're five to six years ago there were much more defensive just trying to keep the shop running appropriately.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Paul, wanted to ask you about how -- when you look at that by 20, dilutive impact of the warrant, it looks like you kind curve into there is may be diminishing increase as the stock price goes higher. And over the last year share count even though you accelerated share repurchase over last two quarters is still going up because of the impact of these warrants. Is that the goal and expectation that that share count can start now that go down as the impact from higher stock prices becomes a little less?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I know your first point you got a very sharp eye Marty although I would say that that curve is probably not overly pronounced. I would describe there is more linear then curve but it is slightly curved. So as I said in my prepared remarks depending upon the kind of continued reaction of our share price to again some pretty significantly improved fundamentals you have over the last couple of years. All other things equal obviously, if the share price doesn\u2019t move from here then we would expect the share repurchases to have much more direct impact on diluted shares outstanding. It's just what we have been experiencing off course is a share price increase that has been -- that is exceeded our ability under our capital plan to go out and buy back stock.","Marty Mosby","And then the other thing that\u2019s really just much more of a suggestion as we -- you were highlighting Investor Day coming up here shortly. That with the technology spend that you're talked about, there has been such a significant project. They've really been able to talk about because you don\u2019t see those expenses in the short run, they really get capitalized and then they kind run out overtime. But to really kind outline, one, what are the benefits that you're beginning to see and how that they start to really kick in? And then two how much we kind behind the scene capitalizing eventually is going to start amortize as the systems going to play?","Scott McLean","Marty, it's Scott. It\u2019s a great point and we do plan on focusing on that as well as our simplification initiatives is well on Investor Day. Thanks to many subjects we will talk about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","The decision to move away from the holding company structure to something simpler, could you talk a bit about how you made that decision and in particular on timing why announced when there is a legislative process underway that could result in significantly reduced regulation one a way until you see the outcome of that and then decided dropping the whole curve as the bank think to do?","Harris Simmons","Sure. I would say that the process began about a year and a half ago, and as we were made the decision to consolidate the various charters that we had -- we had I think we call seven different banking subsidiaries and that required a holding company. Once we consolidated the charters I guess I sort of asking myself the question in the name of simplifying life. I ask myself what was the benefit in having a bank holding company. And particularly as we look at our presence and perspective mix of businesses and operations, what can be done in a bank? What can\u2019t be done in a bank? And frankly, virtually everything we're doing operationally in terms of business lines of business can be done in a bank.","Now in times past there were some things that you could do some of which are now prohibited by the Walter rule for example and also we've been winding down some of those investments and but you know the likelihood that we're going to find ourselves underwriting the equities and we're engaging in merchant banking and you know there's a domestic commercial bank. There's precious little in my view that you can really do with a holding company that you can't do in a bank, and that small set of things that you can do in a holding company are probably best left to very-very large companies.","And so that was the mindset as we set about investigating the opportunity, I can that I probably spent more time working on this legislation than any banker in America and so I mean I talked to a lots of Congressmen I think I know business landscape pretty well. And I'm highly in favor of the legislation and I think that I hoped that the Crapo bill will pass. But it's sort of dawn on us that it couldn't deliver one thing that merging a holding company into the bank could deliver and that was eliminating duplicate regulator altogether so the Crapo bill, they set the threshold at $250 billion will certainly be helpful to a lot of banks in terms of you know being subject to the Fed's stress test their models etc, but should still have in our case the OCC and the federal reserve coming in and performing examinations.","And I think most anyway you cut it, we said there's a lot of overlap in what they're doing and so that's fundamentally where we said we think that this is ultimately what the you know the right thing to do because it will give us good supervision, regulation, but it won't give us duplicate regulation every time we turnaround, which we've been seeing increasingly in recent years. So, that's fundamentally the reason behind it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JP Morgan. Your question please.","Steven Alexopoulos","I'd like to start regarding the corporate tax rate coming down for your commercial customers. I'd imagine that as cash flows improve on a net basis, you might see upgrades and the need for reserve. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and if that could have a material impact on credit quality?","Harris Simmons","Yes, the jury out on that, obviously, and there's also speculation among some of our -- some of the larger borrowers in the economy which as you know we don't generally lend to our clients particularly on the commercial side are some kind of small business and smaller and middle markets. There's some of those may take extra cash either coming from offshore otherwise to use that to pay down debt. I am not personally -- I don't think we're expecting a big effect of that on our core client base, nor are we expecting because again our clients look different than the much larger clients, nor are we expecting a material change in the credit quality. Although there's a lot yet to be seen I think as the effect of the tax legislation shakes through the economy.","Steven Alexopoulos","Then an unrelated question on C&I loan growth, Zions Bank saw a $200 million decline quarter-over-quarter but you had nice growth in CB&T. Can you give a little color on each of those?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, there was a lot of activity at quarter end and I just -- in fact I don't have the details. I don't know that we could give you that color at the moment. We may be able to at our Investor Day give you a little more insight.","James Abbott","Steven, this is James, I'll just jump in with a little bit though as it, there've been some loans that have been maturing or being rebooked as they mature from some of our large scale part utility type of deals that are being rebooked in the geographies in which they exist. So, historically for example some alternative energy lending and types of things have been booked within Utah Bank. And that those some of that's being moved to California where it is actually based geographically but -- so there would be some of it.","Harris Simmons","There would be a piece of it, but not a great big piece in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Just going back to the efficiency ratio. In the press release, you mentioned the 60% for 2019 as well. Can you just give us a little background -- just remind us, is there any fundamental reason why your efficiency ratio should be sustainably higher than a lot of the other sort of similar sized peers, because a lot of the banks of around your size are coming out with target somewhere like the mid -- call it mid to low 50s give or take just as a technology piece? Does it go down after all of your the future core spending slows? Just trying to understand the farther long term look?","Harris Simmons","I guess I -- listen I'd say that, it's hard to speak to where they think they are going to get that kind of additional boost to get some down and to the low 50. So I think as we look at the peer group, which we measure I think which we measure our progress, we're getting to a point where we are closing in on sort of the median. We are at 61.6% for 2017 going into 2018, there are couple of headwinds as noted the lower tax benefit on the legacy municipal, securities and loans portfolio combined with that the bonuses and salary growth that we announced about the end of the year combines throughout 90 basis points that's about 90 basis points of efficiency ratio.","So that's some out of the headwind and we think despite that we're going to get a challenge to somewhere closer to 60 basis points. And I guess it gets incrementally more difficult but I think we get down I think very much within the kind of at least the middle of the pack it's not better overtime than our peer group. I do think but there are couple of things that our headwinds one is the technology stand that we've talked about that's about $35 million roughly going through the income statement annually on replacing core systems off course as Scott mentioned were also spending money on digital etcetera.","The other is that we have a the profile of our commercial loan portfolio is decidedly different from a lot of our peers it is smaller to the medium size of any commercial loan here is decidedly smaller than what you would see in the most of our peers and that's a little more expensive model I think to run but I think it also produces some benefits in terms of that kind of deposit base and we have and traditionally the kinds of loan yields that at the end we will achieve. So I don\u2019t know exactly how to measure that against peers, but I think that's probably a factor. But I think nevertheless we're going to find ourselves very close to where peers are already here within the next 24 months.","Paul Burdiss","If I can just jump in there Ken, I've just as of Friday the peer consensus efficiency ratio for 2019 was about 58.5% so were our goals are not substantially different from that I would tell you and that's consistent with what Harris just said. The top cortile is about 57% so there is not a huge range between the peer groups that we said is planned today.","Harris Simmons","And just to continue within that topic I know that couple of other things one is the effective tax while change is going to be about a 90% and that was 90 basis points increase in our efficiency ratio that's number one. And then you refer back to the press release which is Page 4 where we talk about inefficiency ratio that kind of near is 60%. I would note that could be higher or lower and so I would ask you to keep that in mind also and reference to what just what James just said kind of peer group relative.","And it sounds like the peers I think have not been doing necessarily a near-term, but more of our medium and longer term efficiency ratio outlook and just to be really clear that\u2019s not what we provided here. What we're trying to express is that to a continued growth and pro provision of that revenue our efficiency ratio is going to continue to decline and improve.","Ken Zerbe","And just as a follow up. After you really -- your slide deck on provision expense obviously has negative this quarter. The way of it reads I know you say modest there, but is it possible you could have either quarter or several quarters where between further oil and gas reserve release and Hurricane Harvey again, you could actually have sort of persistently negative provision at least for some short period during the year?","Paul Burdiss","This is Paul. I would say as frankly its possible, as we said, as we noted here there may be some releases as credit quality continues to improve and we had seen a fairly long line of continued credit quality improvement and charge offs would have been very good until we provide incremental growth, to the extent we have charge offs even that recoveries in some cases that\u2019s absolutely possible.","Ken Zerbe","Okay thank you.","James Abbott","And so this is James. We're at the end of about an hour, so we do have few questions to go so its lighting round variety here and we will just pick one primary question and one. Thanks.","Operator","Thanks. So the next question comes from Emlen Harmon of JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Emlen Harmon","More I've got queued for you as a couple of parts, so we can do a quick follow up from that. Just in terms of bringing the money market balances on to the balance sheet, how much of that do you plan to relay to drive deposit growth and just what's the potential impact on deposit yields?","Harris Simmons","Well, we haven't been very specific about that and it is identified as an opportunity. And we expected to be a significant part of our funding strategy over the course of next several quarters, as we said. But we now had provided specifics with respect to how that may affect over our yields, though I would say, I mean you can kind look at our wholesale borrowings and what is yield is on that, you can see that I think Page 17 in the press release and recognize that we would be bringing these on at a rate which is better than where we borrowing in the wholesale market.","Operator","Next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","On the tax benefit just wanted to get your thought on how much of this benefit is likely to accrete to the bottom line and stay there? Or how much would you say that you're putting back in the business or ultimately going to get more competitive with?","Paul Burdiss","I'll take a stab otherwise. I find myself thinking about pretty much like deposit basis I guess. Whole like you can go on to, we're not deliberately going out and using it to try and buy market share. I think overtime the way markets work is that, it will -- a major portion of it probably dissipate end of way. But I think that will take a little bit of time. And so I think will capture most of that benefit 2018 incrementally less as we go along its markets just. This is one of these high class problems that corporate America haven't have the rest of which for very long-time so.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dave Rochester","Just one quick one on expenses. I know you guys mentioned giving some more detail later on the simplification effort. But can you just give an update on whether you still see that as a multiyear opportunity to control expense growth? And are you expecting any rate sensitivity in that expense growth guidance, meaning, if we were to see a bunch of rate hikes? Could that possibly allow for some expense growth for you?","Scott McLean","Dave, this is Scott McLean. I just think as we talk more at the Investor Day about the, what simplification is look like in our company. I happen to believe that the -- we're just getting started, we made a lot of really good progress in big areas, but we have a lot of other areas and now there's a lot of energy around this subject has been. And I think we're getting more effective in executing more quickly on creating change, and everyone of those simplification processes -- in many cases, it reduces cost but in some cases it increases revenue, certainly has an impact on customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. So I think as we talk more about that story and tell that story more appropriately I think you'll -- think most investors will be encouraged by it.","Dave Rochester","Great. Thanks and then.","Scott McLean","I'm sorry you mentioned the expense growth -- sorry, you know we would have to see really solid core revenue growth coming from things other than just interest rate changes. I think we're driven by a loan deposit pre-income growth, as long as those fundamentals are increasing we'll probably lean into those businesses and in terms of supporting people and technologies. But just getting increased rate benefit I think we'll be very conscious of not spending that away inappropriately.","Operator","Next question comes from Chris Spahr of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Chris Spahr","My question is regard to your fee income and this seems to be one of the best core fee income numbers that you put up and I guess in the history of the firm, at least you've been a customer related fee income yet your guidance for next year really hasn't changed that much, and almost implied like a lower level of run rate that you posted in the fourth quarter. So what happened in the fourth quarter that was better than expected? And what can you do to kind of kick start fee income to kind of at least change your outlook on that line?","Scott McLean","Sure, thank you. This is Scott. This is where quarter-over-quarter comparisons to get a little out of whack. We felt great about the fourth quarter of this year versus the fourth quarter of last year, but it's really 12 months run rates as we look at and that mid single digit growth rate is what we're still guiding to. But this fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of '16, we just saw you know really strong numbers in those two quarterly comparisons related to our normal workhorse fee income categories like treasury management, bank card. But we saw some really unusual increases in municipal finance, foreign exchange and a number of others that our wealth business that just happened to have really strong 4Q versus 4Q comparisons. Having said all that, I think if we can put up 5% mid single digit growth rate numbers in fee income, these are very basic products. We are not selling investment banking or exotic capital markets activities, and so these are generally businesses that grow kind of mid single digit growth rates.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?","James Abbott","Thank you very much. Appreciate that, everyone joining the call today. We -- as it's been mentioned a couple of times in the call today, we do have an Investor Day coming up on March 1st. It is mentioned on Page 7 of the earnings release. The event is expected to begin at 8 AM Mountain Time, 10 AM Eastern Time. We expect the event to run for several hours, and we'll be webcasting that, although we'd be delighted, if you'd join us in person, sounds more enjoyable.

You joined Zions Bancorporation's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. James Abbott. Sir, you may begin.","James Abbott","Thanks, Latif, and good evening everyone. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2017 first quarter earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial objectives; after which Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook for the next four quarters. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Ed Schreiber, Chief Risk Officer; and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer.","Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation and the earnings call contains several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the differences between such measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour. During the question-and-answer session of this call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","With that, I will now turn the time over to Harris.","Harris Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and welcome to all of you to our call today to discuss the first quarter results. The results for the quarter were strong relative to year-ago results. On Slide 3, we summarize a few of the key financial accomplishments that we've made over the past year. Many of the results of our simple, easy, fast initiative have helped to produce the strong earnings per share growth and profitability improvement shown on this slide. And the efforts of the past several years to bolster risk management, together with improved conditions in the energy sector, have resulted in greatly improved credit quality metrics.","Slide 4 highlights our earnings per share growth over the past year and also refers back to the fourth quarter of 2014 to show a longer-terms perspective. The GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.09 includes a couple of items that are operating in nature but are generally infrequent in their occurrence, so we're calling those out there. Should one elect to adjust for those, the diluted earnings per share would have been approximately $0.88 per share that compares to a year ago period of $0.61 per share, about a 44% increase.","While that pace of earnings growth will obviously subside, we do feel confident that we\u2019re in a position to continue to deliver solid core earnings per share growth in the foreseeable future. One of the real highlights of the first quarter 2018 is the continued strong improvement to credit quality. On Slide 5, you'll see the strong trends depicted on the chart on the right, classified loans declining a very strong 30% from the year ago period. Oil and gas loans were meaningful driver of the improvement, accounting for 81% of the year-over-year improvement in classified loans.","Net charge-offs of the quarter were only 5 basis points and we expect that credit recoveries which were $21 million will remain a beneficial factor in the remaining months of 2018 and will contribute to what we expect will be a low overall rate of net charge-offs. On a related topic, a major reason for the particularly strong GAAP diluted EPS result was a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, which declined $52 million from the prior quarter and resulted in a negative provision for credit losses of $47 million, driven primarily by improvements in our oil and gas portfolio as well as much greater clarity around the minimal effect of Hurricane Harvey's impact on our loan portfolio.","Importantly, the problem loan coverage of the allowance for credit losses did not deteriorate and in fact, strengthened somewhat. The allowance was about 1.3x our non-performing asset balance and about 0.5x our classified loan balance, both of which ratios are moderately stronger than the year-ago period. The other major theme that has developed over the past three years is strong and consistent growth in pre-provision net revenue as depicted on Slide 6.","Adjusted for the items mentioned previously, our adjusted pre-provision net revenue increased 19% from the year-ago quarter. We expect to continue to experience growth of pre-provision net revenue in the high single digit range without giving consideration to additional interest rate increases by the Federal Open Market Committee. We have good momentum in the key areas of revenue growth. The macroeconomic environment is certainly helping. Tax reform will be a major boost through the remainder of the year, and noninterest expense should remain well controlled growing only slightly in 2018.","Slide 7 highlights two key profitability metrics return on assets and return on tangible common equity. We\u2019re encouraged by the continued improvement in these balance sheet profitability ratios and remain focused on achieving competitive returns on our assets relative to peers. Moving to Slide 8, we experienced 5.4% year-over-year growth in average loans held for investment despite continued attrition in several portfolios as Paul will highlight. Achieving deposit growth has been a greater challenge, although that might be expected given the fact that the Fed is drawing liquidity from the system and because we've remained very disciplined on deposit pricing.","We expect to remain disciplined with deposit pricing. We've experienced some pressure on larger dollar deposits, but we generally have a very granular deposit base, including a strong concentration of operating accounts for businesses and households. Additionally, we have a highly liquid balance sheet. These factors should help to mitigate deposit price sensitivity. Slide 9 is a list of our key objectives for 2018-2019 and our commitment to shareholders. We remain focused on simplification as well as growth, which include balance sheet, revenue, pre-provision net revenue and earnings per share growth. We\u2019re committed to continuing to achieve positive operating leverage.","We have momentum in most areas of revenue generation. We have an economic tailwind with rising interest rates and strong customer sentiment. We\u2019re targeting high single-digit growth of pre-provision net revenue without the assistance of benchmark interest rate increases. We believe we've built a very strong risk management infrastructure, and as such, we expect to reduce level of volatility in credit quality during the next downturn, whenever that maybe. And we noted at our recent Investor Day that we expect to be in the best quartile among our peers for net charge-offs when that next credit cycle has run its course.","We continue to invest significantly in technology improvements, which includes a substantial overhaul to our core operating systems, which we expect will deliver benefits for years to come. We remain committed to further improvement and simplification of our operational processes. Although we've already accomplished a great deal of operational and financial simplification, we believe there's still much we can accomplish, which we believe will result in further improvements in the efficiency ratio, balance sheet profitability measures and better satisfaction for customers and employees.","Because of simplification efforts taken in 2015 and subsequent to our announcement in mid-2015 of some earnings measures that we are determined to hit because of our quest to simplify operations further, we announced in November that we expect to demerge the bank holding company into the bank, which would streamline our regulatory requirements. We filed our merger application, and this week, we expect to submit our appeal to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, requesting that we be de-designated as a systemically important financial institution. We expect we'll have a preliminary answer from the FSOC within about three months and a final answer sometime this fall.","Back in 2015, we indicated that we are going to be targeting much more substantial returns on capital than what we could be seen then. As I just mentioned, there's still room for improvement, some of which should be achieved as we continue to rightsize our capital structure. Regarding returns of capital, we have increased that amount to a level slightly above the peer median, and we view a moderate increase of balance sheet leverage is appropriate, particularly given the reduction of the risk profile of the company. And we remain committed to the community bank approach that we've had for long time, maintaining separate brands that we believe help the company win awards such as the Best Bank in Orange County, California, San Diego County, state of Nevada and others and that result in a customer profile that is particularly attractive.","With that overview, I am going to turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to go through the financial statements in a little more detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good evening everyone and thank you for joining our call. I will begin on Slide 10. For the first quarter of 2018, Zions reported net earnings applicable to common shareholders of $231 million, or $1.09 per diluted share. We have highlighted a handful of rows on this page that experienced particularly notable improvements over the prior year. It's worth highlighting the change in the effect of tax rate, which is much lower than in the prior quarter. As you may recall, in the prior quarter, we experienced a revaluation of our deferred tax asset due to passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the related change in the statutory corporate federal tax rate.","In addition to the DTA revaluation, we had a higher statutory tax rate in the prior year than we had in the first quarter of 2018, also because of the passage of the Act. In the first quarter of 2017, however, we experienced a relatively low effective tax rate due to a one-time adjustment related to state tax returns, which did not occur again in the first quarter of 2018. Earlier, Harris highlighted our strong pre-provision net revenue growth.","Turning to Slide 11, I'll add some additional color about the components behind that strong growth. Nearly 80% of our revenue comes from net interest income, which continued to demonstrate substantial growth in the fourth quarter relative to the prior year period.","Harris Simmons","First quarter. ","Paul Burdiss","Sorry, in the first quarter relative to the prior year period. Net interest income increased $53 million or 11%, which included $11 million of interest recoveries from four loans, similar to our experience in the second quarter of 2017. Interest income increased approximately $74 million or 14% from the year-ago period, of which 86% is attributable to growth in interest income on loans with the remaining attributable to the investment portfolio.","With respect to revenue drivers, I'll discuss earning asset volume first then transition to rates. Slide 12 is a graphical representation of our loan growth by type relative to the year-ago period. The size of the circles represents the relative size of the loan portfolios, and the circles are ordered by size left to right from smallest to largest portfolios.","Total period-end loan growth was 5.5%. I would note the relatively balanced growth across most components of the loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial, owner-occupied and home equity loans all increased in the mid- to high single-digit range, a trend that has been fairly consistent for several quarters. Municipal loan growth has been strong during the past year. The credit quality of the production is very strong with very low probabilities of default.","Commercial real estate, including the construction and the term portfolios, increased slightly. Although from a risk management perspective, we are comfortable growing that portfolio, the pricing of deals in the commercial real estate space has become more competitive during the past three months, much more than for commercial and industrial loans, and therefore, the commercial real estate growth may be a bit less than previously anticipated. Putting it all together, we remain comfortable with our loan growth outlook for moderate growth, which is interpreted \u2013 which is to be interpreted as a mid-single-digit annual rate of growth.","Slide 13 breaks down key rate and cost components of our net interest margin. Top line is loan yield, which increased to 4.51%, of which about nine basis points are related to interest recoveries on four larger loans. Such recoveries may be somewhat episodic in frequency. New loan production for the first quarter was moderately higher than the yield of the portfolio. Without future rate hikes and excluding the nine basis points of interest recoveries in the first quarter, we expect the yield on the loan portfolio to increase slightly from the current level. The yield on securities is likely to increase modestly over time as the yield on new securities is higher than the current portfolio yield.","However, we do have more than $500 million of premium on the securities portfolio, and as such, swings of prepayment speeds can create a bit of yield volatility from quarter-to-quarter. The duration of the securities portfolio was 3.4 years at March 31, 2018. After shocking the portfolio by increasing the yield curve by 200 basis points, there is a minimal 0.2-year increase in duration.","Touching on deposit costs, the average cost of total deposits increased to 15 basis points from 10 basis points a year ago, and the cost of interest-bearing deposits increased to 20 basis points from 19 basis points a year ago. With the daily average federal funds target rate of 73 basis points during the same period, the total deposit beta was about 7% and the interest-bearing deposit beta was about 12%. As a reminder, beta refers to the incremental cost of deposits relative to an increase in the benchmark federal funds rate. We still see a fair amount of stability in almost all of our products and regions, although certain geographies and products have experienced higher deposit betas.","I\u2019ll also note that on Page 15 of the earnings release, the average balance \u2013 in the average balance sheet section, about three quarters the way down the page, we've added a line that sums the cost of total deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, which had a total cost of 33 basis points, up from 18 basis points a year ago. One might refer to this as the total funding beta, and for Zions, this was about 20% over the prior year. We highlight this because this is how we think about balance sheet management, a holistic view of assets and liabilities.","With that, let's move to a brief review of noninterest income on Slide 14. Customer-related fees increased 7% over the prior year to $123 million. Several line items experienced a favorable improvement relative to the year-ago period, including loan fees from our syndication efforts, Wealth Management fees, corporate card and business and consumer credit card and interest rate swaps sold to customers to help them hedge their interest rate risk.","Noninterest expense on Slide 15 decreased to $412 million from $414 million in the year-ago period. However, using our calculated adjusted noninterest expense, which adjusts for items such as severance, provision for unfunded lending commitments and other items, noninterest expense increased to $419 million from $411 million in the year-ago period or about 2%. A portion of the increase relates to additional compensation that we announced in conjunction with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will be paid to most employees making less than $100,000. The remainder is attributable to an increase in health care costs, higher profit sharing, normal cost of living adjustments for existing employees and a modest number of net new full-time employees.","Turning to Slide 16. The efficiency ratio was approximately 62% if excluding the items I noted earlier. You may recall that the first quarter of each year typically reflects lower revenue because of fewer days of interest income and higher salary and benefit expense due to payroll taxes and stock-based compensation. Also, when comparing the results to the prior quarter, there was an additional adverse impact to the efficiency ratio in the first quarter of 2018 related to the tax rate used when grossing up income from municipal loans and securities in order to arrive at a fully taxable equivalent net interest income result. That change adversely affected the efficiency ratio by just over 30 basis points in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2017. We are reiterating our goal to achieve an efficiency ratio below 60% for the full year of 2019, excluding the possible benefits of rate increases.","And finally, Slide 17 depicts our financial outlook for the next 12 months relative to the first quarter of 2018. In the interest of opening up the line for questions, I won't read the slide to you, but we'll be happy to take questions about it. This concludes our prepared remarks.","Latif, would you please open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of ","Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dave Rochester","Hey good afternoon guys.","Harris Simmons","Dave.","Dave Rochester","On the loan pipeline heading into 2Q, you guys had a nice pickup in loan growth last year in 2Q. Are you seeing similar strength versus what you saw this time last year ex this CRE pricing issue you mention? ","Scott McLean","Yes Dave this is Scott McLean. We wouldn't normally comment on sort of inter-quarter math, but we think this quarter will probably look like our traditional second quarter. So we're seeing really good progress across the loan portfolio as we have been over the last year.","Dave Rochester","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, just \u2013 go ahead.","Harris Simmons","Off to a stronger start in the second quarter than we were in the first, I think, is also fair to say. So three weeks doesn't a quarter make. We're off to a little better start than last quarter. ","Dave Rochester","Great, I appreciate that. And then just one quick follow-up. In terms of that loan growth, what are the chances that you can fund loan growth with deposit growth this year?","Paul Burdiss","Well, I'll start then Harris and Scott can chime in. As noted in our comments, deposits have been kind of chopping sideways over the course of the last year as the marketplace gets more competitive. That being said, we have a lot of client money that exists off our balance sheet, and we're looking for ways to create products and opportunities to waive that money back onto the balance sheet.","Scott McLean","And really, the \u2013 this is Scott. The game is really involving wholesale deposits, the large deposit balances of our larger clients. And generally, these are $10 million, $20 million, $40 million, $50 million balances and as well as the sweep balances that are off our balance sheet as Paul related. And we are getting increasingly more agile at pricing those wholesale deposits. As you know, we're borrowing overnight from the Federal Home Loan Bank, and we still have quite a bit of competitive room to price deposits and still be at a significant advantage to that overnight borrowing rate. And we would like to think that as we go into the end of the year, second half of the year, we'll see improvement in that area. ","Dave Rochester","So the goal is to effectively fund the loan growth with deposit growth completely this year?","Scott McLean","That would be the goal, yes. ","Dave Rochester","Okay, great. Thanks guys. Thank you.","Scott McLean","We have room to do that in a financially beneficial way to the company.","Dave Rochester","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. I guess, at one point, you guys had assumed a fairly large decline in your noninterest-bearing deposits in your rate sensitivity tables. Doesn't seem to be happening in terms of just looking at that Page 15 in the press release, like NIBD is pretty stable. Is that still a fair assumption? Do you think that we all should be making that, at some point, noninterest-bearing actually does start to decline in a more meaningful way as rates keep rising? Or is \u2013 or are things different? Thanks.","Harris Simmons","Well, I guess, I continue to believe that continued increase in interest rates that, that would be something that we would expect. I mean, we've been at about 45% of total deposits, in demand deposits. And in a more traditionally normal interest rate kind of environment, I have a hard time thinking that, that's what normal is. But happily, we haven't seen that so much so far, and I do think we have \u2013 I mean, we have a fabulous deposit base. And as we\u2019ve noted, it\u2019s a very \u2013 a lot of small business deposits, and we think they\u2019re pretty sticky. A lot of them are supporting the operational needs and paying for services, treasury management, other services.","And that helps put us \u2013 as rates rise, earning credit rates will rise and they\u2019ll need less of that. So I continue to think you\u2019ll probably see some runoff as \u2013 or not runoff but it\u2019s switching into interest-bearing accounts as we get further into the rate normalization process here.","Scott McLean","I\u2019ll just add to that, that you look back over the last couple of decades, even longer. We\u2019ve had a favorable mix of DDA. The total deposits compared to our peers, it\u2019s not \u2013 if it\u2019s not industry leading, it\u2019s very close. And for all the reasons Harris just noted, I think we\u2019ll maintain that strong relative position to peers for the reasons he indicated.","Ken Zerbe","Got you, okay. And then just going back to the balance sheet growth this year. Does there come a point where growing your loan portfolio with deposits just doesn\u2019t make sense, I mean, meaning that you\u2019d actually choose to, whatever, not pay up for deposits but you\u2019d actually use your securities portfolio instead by choice to fund loan growth?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. Ken, this is Paul. That\u2019s a possibility, although I \u2013 funds can come from a number of sources. As you said, they can come from deposits. They can come from other wholesale borrowings or they can come out of other assets such as securities portfolio. So all that being said, we don\u2019t anticipate there being such a advantage to funding by decreasing securities relative to those other sources of funding. So I would say, of the three that I outlined, that would probably be our last choice. And as Scott and Harris have both mentioned, we\u2019re pretty confident on balance sheet growth this year.","Harris Simmons","I\u2019ll also just say, I mean, the \u2013 we really price the deposit base we have. We\u2019re going to be careful to make sure that we hold onto them. We\u2019re not going to put \u2013 if we start to see movement in smaller dollar accounts because of interest rate sets, that\u2019s something we pay attention to so.","Scott McLean","I think you also have to look at the kind of lending we do. The kind of lending we do, the portfolios we have on the page that Paul pointed out are generally very deposit friendly type portfolios. They come with deposits. If you saw us talking about really big increases in real estate lending, it generally doesn\u2019t attract deposits with it. Really big corporate lending doesn\u2019t attract deposits. And so again, the kind of lending that we do generally, deposits come along pretty nicely with it.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Great, thank you.","Harris Simmons","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Hey, John.","John Pancari","Regarding the ROE, I know, Harris, you mentioned you\u2019re looking to return a substantial amount of capital but also return on capital as you indicated on Slide 9 as well. You guys didn\u2019t provide an actual outlook on your ROE at your Investor Day. Can you elaborate a little bit on your thinking on where you think that could head, if you can give us some idea of where the ROE could go? Some color there would be helpful.","Harris Simmons","Well, just generally, I think it can go up from where it\u2019s been. I mean, obviously, this quarter had \u2013 because of the negative provision, this quarter\u2019s ROE is a little unfair to compare anything in the near-term to. But we\u2019ve done a lot to really change in a very positive way the risk profile of the company, and I don\u2019t want to be going into a downturn ever behind the goal line. And I think we \u2013 and we kind of did that back in 2008. But at the same time, our common equity Tier 1 ratio is very strong. I think it can come down.","Some of that, I expect, will come from growth, but there\u2019s a lot of capital that needs to continue to be paid out to manage that appropriately. And as that happens and we continue to see a little better balance sheet profitability, better \u2013 continued operating leverage, I do expect it will continue to increase and ultimately, to be very competitive with what you see from many of our peers. My \u2013 when I say ultimately I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a long-term kind of project. It\u2019s like \u2013 I think it goes out a couple of years.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks for that. And then on that point you made earlier that this quarter benefited from the lower loan loss provision or the negative provision, you put up a negative provision now I guess, a couple quarters in a row. And how do you think about \u2013 I know your guidance is for a modest LLP. Can you help define modest? I mean, is there likelihood that you bleed this reserve incrementally from the 1.05% level? Thanks.","Harris Simmons","Let me \u2013 I want to talk about how we think about it internally first. I think about the reserve and the provision as an accounting exercise and a little detached from the real operating results of the company. For example, all of our incentive compensation arrangements are built around pre-provision net revenue less actual net charge-offs because until something\u2019s actually charged off, it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, we have all kinds of bets around the tables as to what the losses are actually going to be. We have a very thorough process to \u2013 and we spent a lot of time trying to get to the right allowance number and a resulting provision number.","But fundamentally, we\u2019re focused on what are losses going to look like, net charge-offs. And now having said all that, we\u2019re getting to a point, right? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of additional room to keep running down a reserve. This quarter was a little special because we\u2019d set up in the third quarter of last year about a $34 million reserve for Hurricane Harvey, and we still had a very strong reserve for energy. And as we got to this point, we\u2019re now three months into this year. We can look back to the end of August in Hurricane Harvey and we\u2019ve \u2013 five months have passed, and we say it\u2019s \u2013 or six months have passed, we say it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re at a point now where we can pretty well see that the impact of that is going to be negligible.","And so we\u2019ve really needed to release a lot of that reserve. And likewise with energy. I mean, we\u2019ve got $68 oil. And we\u2019ve been through the portfolio pretty carefully, and we think that, that story is pretty much over. So a lot of what you\u2019re seeing this quarter is really because of those two pieces, but beyond that, there\u2019s not a lot of \u2013 probably a lot of room to be doing much with the reserve.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. Thanks, Harris.","Harris Simmons","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your question please.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good afternoon. Paul, can I come back to your question? On Slide 6, you talk about expecting a stable balance sheet and investment portfolio. So I just wanted to deepen the questioning about how strong you intend to go on this remixing of the deposit base. And so we\u2019re talking about a flat earning asset base, but your loans grow and then you just remix the deposits away from that higher cost funding. Is that the goal in terms of that comment about stable balance sheet?","Paul Burdiss","Yes. I think if I misspoke, I apologize. That\u2019s certainly \u2013 I was not trying to convey that our earning assets are going to be flat. My expectation is that the investment portfolio probably won\u2019t grow much, but we\u2019re certainly expecting our loans to grow. And as discussed previously, we\u2019re hopeful that, that loan growth will be supported by deposit growth. But I would not say that deposit growth is going to be a constraint to loan growth. So I apologize if I wasn\u2019t clear, but my expectation is the earning assets will continue to grow. It\u2019s just that the investment portfolio, I expect to be relatively stable.","Ken Usdin","Understood. That\u2019s great. Great, thanks for clearing that up. My second question, on the premium amortization, you mentioned there\u2019s $500 million less. Can you help us understand how much of it is in the run rate? And what drives the deltas of that going forward in terms of how ratably or episodic it is as it comes through the investment portfolio yield? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Yes. It\u2019s really predicated on prepayments. As you know, changes there \u2013 and there are \u2013 our portfolio is a little unique in that we\u2019ve got a fairly large component of floating rate assets that\u2019s in our SBA book. There\u2019s about $2 billion, and those have about a 10% premium attached to them. So $200 million is related to \u2013 approximately $200 million is related to that $2 billion of SBA. So the remainder of it is associated with the $15 billion \u2013 the $13 billion of remainder kind of AFS.","But it\u2019s \u2013 prepayments generally are driving the amortization of that premium. And so when you look at the MBS, that\u2019s generally going to be rate driven. That is to say lower rates will drive kind of faster prepayments, and therefore, faster premium amortization. And the opposite is true as rates go up on the MBS portion. And I would ask you to recall and as we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, on the SBA portion, we actually think that the prepayments on those react in an opposite way. That is if interest rates go up, in our experience, the prepayments actually accelerate occasionally on those.","And so the two sort of offset each other, which is why you\u2019re seeing limited extension risk in the portfolio as I mentioned on my comments. So those are the factors that get into premium amortization and fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter.","Ken Usdin","And can you help us establish a base of how much you\u2019re having today? Like, do you give us a number for that?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I\u2019ve got it right in front of me. Hold on a second. It was about \u2013 yes, so about $18 million \u2013 probably about $18 million this quarter.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thank you.","Paul Burdiss","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Brad Milsaps","Hey, good afternoon.","Harris Simmons","Good afternoon.","Brad Milsaps","Just wanted to follow up on the loan growth commentary. When we were there in February meeting with some of your regional folks, they seemed pretty bullish on loan growth overall. Just kind of curious on your thoughts on what would need to happen to come in at the high end of your guidance. And then looks like unfunded commitments are up quite a bit, whereas the mid-single digit\u2019s something more you\u2019re managing to. In other words, do you have the appetite to take that higher if the loan growth\u2019s in fact there?","Scott McLean","Brad, this is Scott. As we said at Investor Day, our \u2013 all of our planning is built around mid-single-digit loan growth. Naturally, in any given time period, we could be above or below that, but we are certainly seeing good strength right now. And if we saw 7%, 8%, 9% loan growth, we wouldn\u2019t try to hold that back. That would be a very natural kind of \u2013 we can certainly maintain that kind of loan growth or management if we are able to achieve it.","And I \u2013 just in terms of color, if you really look at loan, year-over-year growth in our various portfolios, you can see that in the slides and the appendix but really solid growth across almost all of our affiliates, Texas, California, Arizona, Colorado, Washington, really strong C&I growth. CRE actually contracted last year as you know. And so \u2013 and really strong consumer growth principally one to four family mortgage, but our HECL portfolio has done well. And as you know, in the last downturn, both our home equity HECL portfolio and one to four family did very well as did our C&I \u2013 non-energy-related C&I.","And so what would have to change? A couple of things, where we haven\u2019t seen any CRE growth, we probably will see CRE growth this year. That would be a factor that could push us into higher growth rates for the whole portfolio. Energy, you\u2019ll notice for the first quarter year-over-year, energy is now flat and to up very slightly, and it would not be unusual for us to see energy growth again as we\u2019ve said in various public settings, including the Investor Day. That could push our growth higher.","Those would be two, I think, key factors in addition to just continued solid consumer growth and small business growth that is coming in very little pieces. But we\u2019re getting those processes much more efficient than they\u2019ve ever been before, and so our colleagues are seeing a much greater pull-through rate on small business lending.","Brad Milsaps","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And just quick follow-up for Paul. You addressed this a little bit with the funding, but the average borrowings in Fed Funds were, I don\u2019t know, up maybe over \u2013 maybe like $1.2 billion for the quarter but then down at period-end. Would you expect that it would be closer to the period-end balance going forward? Or is that just really dependent upon the other factors you talked about related to deposits, et cetera?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I would characterize it in the latter category. That is highly dependent upon the interplay between loans and loan to deposits.","Brad Milsaps","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You\u2019ve touched a bit on competition on the commercial real estate side. Can you expand a bit on where that competition is coming from?","Harris Simmons","Life insurance companies, mid-sized banks. We\u2019re not seeing \u2013 I think structure is remaining pretty good shape. It\u2019s really just pricing. And pricing has come off 50 basis points, Michael, I think.","Michael Morris","I would say, on the CRE side, off 50; money center banks, 2.","Harris Simmons","Yes. So this \u2013 over the last kind of six months, it\u2019s \u2013 we really have seen a shift. I mean, we\u2019ve actually seen some strength in pricing. I think if we were having this conversation a year ago, I think we\u2019re probably talking about looking stronger, and that\u2019s all gone away. So\u2026","Geoffrey Elliott","So it sounds pretty broad. I mean, just thinking more broadly, are you seeing any signs of tax reform, the benefits of that kind of starting to get competed away on strengths, what\u2019s going on in CRE could be a manifestation of that or just more just kind product specific?","Harris Simmons","No. I think that could be certainly a factor in what we\u2019re seeing there. And I \u2013 anecdotally, I\u2019ve heard a couple of situations where we really believe that\u2019s the case where \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to know what motivates anybody in terms of their pricing.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Keating of Barclays. Your question please.","Matthew Keating","Yes, thank you. My question is on the efficiency ratio. I appreciate the reiteration of the less than 60% efficiency ratio in 2019. I guess, my question is we\u2019ve already seen pretty good year-over-year improvement in the first quarter, and as you look out, I know you\u2019ve been guiding to continuous improvement in the efficiency ratio. But could we get close to that 60% target in 2018 as well? Thanks.","Harris Simmons","Certainly, we could. Yes, it\u2019s mathematically possible.","Paul Burdiss","As you know\u2026","Matthew Keating","I guess, my question is more like what\u2019s slowing down that improvement here now. Is it simply just that the NII growth is slowing here with the securities book flat? Or is it just, again, some of the investments you\u2019re making in technology that are leading to expenses in that \u2013 so that\u2019s [indiscernible] improvement.","Harris Simmons","As we noted, I mean, about \u2013 there\u2019s about 30 basis points of efficiency ratio that\u2019s related just to the change in tax rate on our unique portfolio.","Paul Burdiss","Headwind.","Harris Simmons","A headwind, yes. And I\u2019d continue to note that we are \u2013 we continue to spend on the replacement of our core systems. I mean, we\u2019re spending on technology, and we think that\u2019s absolutely the right thing to be doing. But that probably elevates, and I mean, I \u2013 we\u2019re spending on digital technology as well, but the core replacement is something that\u2019s reasonably relatively unique to us, not totally. But we\u2019re going to continue that \u2013 down that path. We think that\u2019s something that we need to be doing for the long haul. And it will \u2013 we do think it will continue to improve. When it crosses 60% consistently is \u2013 we just \u2013 that kind of precision is beyond what we are in the business of trying to provide, so\u2026","Paul Burdiss","And I\u2019ll just maybe make a qualitative comment. We embarked on this odyssey several years ago. We had a 74% efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we\u2019ve moved that down significantly. And I think, qualitatively, we would all agree that going from 74% to 64% was maybe a little easier than going from 64% to 54%. And so as Harris said, we can expect to continue to make progress. Although it\u2019s easy to get used to the pace of improvement that we\u2019ve observed over the last couple of years, I think we should all expect that to slow down just a little bit.","Matthew Keating","Thank you.","Scott McLean","We\u2019ve clearly guided to this sort of what we\u2019ve referred to as slight increase in noninterest expense, which was sort of defined roughly as 2% to 3% last year. And you can see that in our numbers now. We\u2019re sort of on track with that, and we\u2019re very committed to that.","Harris Simmons","I mean, I find myself thinking a lot more about operating leverage than I do efficiency ratio per se. And we\u2019re investing and we\u2019re hiring producers and trying to make sure that we\u2019re investing in growth. So that can come at the cost of short-term efficiency ratio. We\u2019re just not going to be a slave to efficiency ratio. We needed to be when it was 74%, I think, than with 60% or 62% less so.","Matthew Keating","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of line of Brock Vandervliet of UBS. Your line is open.","Brock Vandervliet","Thanks for taking my question. Yes. I wanted to come at runoff once again. The idea that energy is now flat, I think, is particularly encouraging. Could you talk about the National Real Estate portfolio and what you\u2019re feeling about those dynamics and when we might see that bottom as well?","Scott McLean","It\u2019s still declining at about a 10%, 11% rate, which is roughly a $1.8 billion portfolio \u2013 $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion. And it \u2013 we anticipate it continuing to decline this year as it did last year. It should start to slow, but we could see that portfolio decline over the next 18 to 24 months. But it\u2019s probably the only major portfolio in the company that is seeing that trend.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay. And that was $1.8 billion, you said?","Harris Simmons","$1.7 billion.","Scott McLean","Let\u2019s say $1.7-ish billion.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Abbott for any closing remarks. Sir?","James Abbott","Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to James Abbott, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","James Abbott","Thank you, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our fourth quarter 2015 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Paul Burdiss, Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that during this call we\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in this press release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.","A full copy of the earnings release will be -- as well as a supplemental slide deck are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We\u2019ll be referring to the slides during this call. We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour, which will include a question-and-answer session. During that time we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris Simmons","Thank you, James, and welcome to all of you who are on the call today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. There is obviously a lot of focus on energy and we\u2019ll talk about energy as we get further into the presentation, but I wanted to talk about a variety of things that we think are actually working very nicely before we get to that.","From Slide 3 and the related slides that we\u2019ve distributed, we\u2019ve tried to highlight some of the initiatives that are working well and are within our expectations. I\u2019ll touch on a few of these in my remarks here, but as an overarching comment, I would want to say that I\u2019m quite encouraged with the positive operating leverage that we achieved in the quarter. The positive revenue trajectory, the stable expense levels, and the solid progress that we\u2019ve made on the technology projects that we\u2019re pursuing.","We are highly focused on improving the profitability and growth profile of the Company and we made very tangible progress in 2015 towards those goals. Additionally, despite the weakness in energy commodity prices, we were able to maintain strong overall asset quality metrics and we experienced an encouraging improvement in the rate of loan growth compared to the prior quarter during the fourth quarter here.","On Slide 4, we display our loans and deposits. Relative to the third quarter, we experienced improved loan growth in the fourth quarter of $536 million or about 5% annualized. Excluding the effects of expected energy loan attrition loan growth was more than $700 million or about 8% annualized. We were pleased with growth in areas that are targeted for growth specifically non-energy commercial and industrial and consumer loans.","Deposit growth shown in the chart on the right has been a strong story for Zions for quite some time and the source of that growth has come primarily from the most viable source, which is non-interest bearing deposits. The value of those deposits should increase as rates rise and should lead to a strong increase in earnings if and when interest rates further increase. Thus far, we\u2019ve been able to hold deposit rates quite flat.","Turning to Slide 5, the most significant source of revenue for Zions is net interest income, which equals about 78% of the fourth quarter net revenue. Although a portion of the increase from the prior quarter was driven by interest income recoveries that may not occur in the first quarter of 2016, we expect the interest rate increase in December will offset that factor. Also, driving net interest income higher was the increase in both loans and securities, as well as a material reduction in the interest paid on debt. Accordingly, we expect we will experience similar if not slightly higher net interest income in the first quarter of 2016.","On Slide 6, we\u2019re encouraged with the results from the initiatives we\u2019ve made to grow fee income. Managed fee income increased 4% from the 2014 year and we\u2019re targeting a stronger growth rate in 2016. Managed fee income is defined by us as income sources we manage directly and excludes the effect of dividends, securities gains and losses, and other similar sources. The most significant increase in 2015 was from treasury management, which increased 13%. It also happens to be our strongest contributor to total fee income. Some of the headwinds include loan fees, which were down due in part to soft demand for energy lending, as well as overdraft fees, which is attributable at least in part to strengthening consumer balance sheets.","On Slide 7, we have the cost savings initiative scorecard graph, with the bar on the left illustrating the commitment to achieve $120 million of gross cost savings by the end of 2017. The bar on the right illustrating the cost saves that were accomplished in 2015. We remain on-track to achieve the targeted cost reductions by 2017 having already realized more than half of the goal by the end of 2015. We\u2019re encouraged with the achievement of holding non-interest expense to less than $1.6 billion in 2015. Additionally, our commitment is to hold that line item adjusted for certain restructuring costs to below $1.6 billion in 2016. We expect benefits in 2016 to include the simplification of operations that are due in part to the charter consolidation.","Moving to Slide 8, we have achieved a portion of another key measure of our commitment to shareholders, which was to reduce the efficiency ratio to 70% or below for the second half of 2015. We\u2019re encouraged with this achievement, and we are reiterating our commitment to achieve an efficiency ratio in 2016 of 66% or better, as well as those other targets that we first communicated on June 1st of last year.","On Slide 9, we\u2019re satisfied with the progress we have made on our technology projects. The general ledger transition and new reporting tool conversion are complete. The credit approval workflow system software is installed in most of our banks with the completion scheduled for the spring of this year. The same is true for the enterprise loan operations. We are tracking to a spring completion.","Regarding our core systems replacement project, which we\u2019ve dubbed FutureCore where we\u2019ve partnered with Tata Consultancy Services we are expecting the consumer loan system to rollout later this year with commercial lending tracking for 2017 and the deposits module scheduled for 2018. In summary, we are making significant investments to provide a very strong technology foundation for our future. These are investments that will simplify our operating environment and give us the ability to be highly competitive in an industry where technology is obviously playing an increasingly important role.","Finally as noted in the press release, the consolidation of our seven subsidiary banks to a single national bank charter was completed on December 31st. We\u2019ll continue to emphasize our locally oriented leadership structure and the power of our strong local brands in each market we serve, but we\u2019ll find some additional efficiency from this consolidation of charters. We\u2019re very optimistic about the future operational and financial performance for Zions.","With that brief overview, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Paul Burdiss to review the financial results. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good afternoon everyone. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter of 2015, Zions reported net earnings to common shareholders of $88 million or $0.43 per share. Relative to the third quarter, net interest income increased about 5.5%. Adjusted for recoveries of interest income and a linked-quarter increase in income from loans purchased from the FDIC, net interest income increased just under 3%. Actively managed non-interest income, which excludes investment-related items and securities gains and losses increased slightly from the prior quarter and as Harris noted earlier, increased about 4% for the full year 2015 when compared to the full year of 2014.","At just over $400 million, non-interest expenses were higher in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due in part to elevated levels of expenses in certain categories as detailed in the press release, which accompanies this call. We are encouraged by the efforts of our teammates to manage our cost of doing business. Our collective efforts allowed Zions to realize our goal of adjusted non-interest expense of less than 1.6 billion for 2015.","Turning to the provision for loan and lease losses, we had expected a moderate build in the reserve for energy loans, partially offset by continued reserve release in the rest of the portfolio. Although throughout most of the quarter, we expected the provision for loan losses to be in line with the third quarter result, the decline in the price of oil near the end of the quarter resulted in a moderately higher provision. The energy loan portfolio continues to perform about as we had expected. As we progress through 2016, we expect quarterly provisions to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter results. The key driver of our expectation for an elevated provision in 2016 is the lower prevailing energy prices, actual results may therefore vary from expectations if energy prices remain volatile.","Finally, I would like to highlight the return on tangible common equity. Although we're working to drive shareholder returns to a much higher level, I'll point out that our efforts over the past year have resulted in a better than 100 basis point increase in shareholder returns when compared to the same period a year ago, while capital levels have actually increased slightly during the period.","Turning to Slide 11, I'll address some of the drivers of the net interest income beginning with volume. Details of our investment portfolio are shown here on Slide 11. We have been adding securities to our investment portfolio for the past year or so, reflecting the need for a permanent high-quality liquid asset position in order to manage our balance sheet liquidity more effectively in light of the recently established liquidity coverage ratio rules.","Our efforts to build out the investment portfolio are expected to add revenue in the current and downside economic environments, when compared to holding liquidity in the form of cash. During the fourth quarter we added $1.5 billion to our investment securities portfolio on average when compared to the third quarter. In light of a general market expectation for rising short-term rates, we're exercising caution with respect to the impact on overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity, as we purchase fixed rate investments and duration extension risk inherent in the investment portfolio.","The securities we are adding are relatively short in duration, just over three years. The duration of the entire securities portfolio is estimated to be 2.9 years to-date. If rates were to rise 200 basis points across the curve, our models indicates that the duration of the portfolio would extend only slightly to about 3.1 years. As expected, the addition of these fixed-rate investments reduced Zions\u2019 asset sensitivity somewhat as shown in the table at the bottom-right of the page. Worth nothing, the deposit beta assumptions employed in our slow case are in fact faster than we are seeing in the market today or in plain language, our slow scenario model assumes faster deposit re-pricing than we're currently observing in the market. So the improvement in the net interest income from the December rate hike could and likely will be higher than that shown in the table on the Slide 11.","On Page 12, we breakdown year-over-year loan growth. Overall, we're encouraged with our fourth quarter loan growth despite some headwinds, as Harris mentioned earlier. Compared to the prior quarter, period end loans grew at a little over 5% annualized. Net commercial and industrial loan growth for the last year was about 6% when excluding the effect of energy loan attrition. It is important to note that we have accomplished this growth without an adverse change in our underwriting standards. Year-over-year net churn commercial real estate growth was about 8% when removing the effect of national real estate portfolio.","Residential mortgage continues to be a major focus for growth across our geographic footprint. The other category experienced healthy growth from various subcategories such as home equity and municipal lending. The two portfolios that have been in decline for the past year or more of a national real estate portfolio and the energy portfolio, the national real estate portfolio represents about 6% of loans and the attrition here resulted in a drag of just over 1 percentage point to the overall growth of the loan portfolio during the past year. The rate of decline is slowing for this portfolio and it currently accounts for less than 50% of tangible common equity.","The energy portfolio attrition is well-documented as we have discussed this regularly during the past year, and our outlook remains consistent. As we expect continued attrition as our clients actively work through the current environment for energy prices. To summarize, our outlook on loan growth for the next 12 months is for a slightly to moderately increasing portfolio, which would be in the low-to-mid single-digit rate of growth range.","Another key component of net interest income, which is the yield or rate on the portfolio and loan production can be found on Slide 13. The slide based on key components of our net interest margin. The top-line is the loan yield, which increased 6 basis points in the second quarter to average 4.24%. As described in the press release, it was a recovery of interest income of about $8 million, included in the fourth quarter loan yield, excluding this recovery the loan yield on the portfolio declined about 2 basis points from the prior quarter.","The securities portfolio yield declined slightly this quarter, largely due to the change in composition of the portfolio, as we had new bonds within our guidelines for duration and extension risk. As the bottom of the chart is aligned depicting our cost of funds as a percentage of earning assets which continues to be quite low and declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the reduction of high cost subordinated debt. The net interest margin increased to 3.23%, a 12 basis point increase from the third quarter. If adjusted for the income recovery, the net interest margin would have been about 3.18%. This increase is largely attributable to the change in earning asset mix, more loans and securities in the fourth quarter and less cash, as well as the previously mentioned, reduction of high cost subordinated debt.","Slide 14 provides more detail on loan yields, specifically the coupon, our new loan production versus the total portfolio, which we believe is helpful in understanding the risk to the future yield on loans in the current interest rate environment. The yellow line reflects the GAAP yield on the portfolio. The primary reason for its increase is the previously mentioned interest recoveries. Importantly, the weighted average coupon of loan portfolio has been stable over the past couple of quarters. The coupon of course excludes the effect of amortizing fees, discounts and premiums. The yield on new production also stabilized in the fourth quarter, as we saw the yield on larger loans improve somewhat in December, reflective of the move in LIBOR. Although, our loan officers are seeing some pricing pressure in the smaller loan space, our production coupons have been stable.","Turning to credit quality on Slide 15, I'll be brief and say that we continued to experience generally strong credit quality performance in most geographies and segments, with a notable exception of energy-related loan which are included in our C&I segment. Our reserve for credit loss is quite strong at just under 1.7% of loans, which is nearly two-times our non-performing assets and over a decade worth of charge-offs based on the fourth quarter annualized results. Despite the increase in classified energy-related loans are just under -- I'm sorry, just over $76 million from the prior quarter level. Overall, classified loans increased to only $45 million or 3% in the fourth quarter.","Non-performing assets declined slightly from the prior quarter. Net charge-offs declined due to recoveries, which were $32 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross charge-offs were relatively stable when compared to prior quarter. Our outlook for 2016 net charge-offs is between 30 and 35 basis points of average loans. The majority of these charge-offs are expected to be energy-related.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott to discuss energy lending and the Houston market more broadly.","Scott McLean","Thank you, Paul and I'll start on Slide 17. We've not repeated the table that we have in our earnings release on Page 4 of the earnings release in this -- in the main section of this slide deck, although it can be found in the Appendix, but let me just make some summary comments.","As noted in the press release, energy loan outstandings and commitments declined fairly substantially from the prior quarter and from a year ago. We commented that, we believe this would happened throughout 2015, the decline in outstandings was about 450 million compared to a year ago and commitments are down approximately $1 billion since a year ago. Classified energy loan balance has increased by approximately 76 million from the prior quarter and finished at a level that is actually somewhat better than what we would have expected a year ago. Non-accrual energy loans declined from the prior quarter primarily due to net charge-offs, which is not the way you want to reduce that bucket, but it's important to note that the level does not increase much if you adjust for net charge-offs.","Turning to Slide 16 -- let's see it's not Slide 16, it is probably Slide 17. Yes, or is it okay, I am sorry. Yes, as we noted since late 2014, we have been extremely active in managing the energy portfolio, including the full attention of our entire executive team reviewing the portfolio frequently on a credit-by-credit basis, plus significant interaction with our customers. Based upon that input along with our models, we are updating our outlook for energy loan losses. As noted previously, these various methodologies led us to estimated energy loan losses of between 75 million to 125 million for the nine quarter period ending the fourth quarter of 2016. That was estimated more than a year ago, based up on oil prices near 50.","It is obviously considerably -- the price of oil is obviously considerably lower than that today, with most of that decline occurring during December 2015 and January 2016. So it's appropriate to provide an update to that loss expectation. Assuming $30 per barrel for the next several quarters, we estimate that energy loan losses will be between 75 million and 100 million in 2016. This is on the high-end of the initial range, but it's been driven by the decline in the oil and gas prices relative to the initial expectation. And as Paul just mentioned, we expect total losses for the Company to remain manageable with net charge-offs ranging between 30 and 35 basis points for the entire consolidated portfolio. We continue to build our energy loan loss reserve to a level above 5%, this is a strong reserve, particularly relative to various measures of problem loans and loss expectations that we've reported in the past and that have been reported by our peers.","Yes, on Slide 17, we are providing some additional disclosures on trends in the various major types of energy credits with the orange line representing upstream or exploration and production loans, the green line representing energy services and the yellow line representing all other energy-related loans. On the left is the trend in balances outstanding, despite the capital markets being somewhat quiet in the fourth quarter, we still experienced a substantial decline in balances as borrowers continue to sell assets and use cash flow to reduce debt.","On the top right is the trend in classified energy loans by subtype, with services increasing during the fourth quarter, while classified E&P companies experienced a decline in that quarter. Non-accruals are shown at the bottom. We expect continued downgrades, but we expect that the situation as noted before will be manageable. On Slide 18, we show an updated view of our exposure to commercial real estate in Texas. The darker left hand side of each bar represents the Houston exposure. The point of this slide really is that Houston CRE portfolio is diversified across a variety of asset types, product categories and we are not concentrated in any one particular area with very minimal exposure to land.","Slide 19 is new disclosure for us, which shows the commercial real estate portfolio by cash flow and collateral support. You'll notice that there's very little in the way of tail risk. Property values could decline or cash flow could decline substantially and very few properties would run into substantial trouble. While I'm happy to talk about our exposure to specific product types, there are some keys to our commercial real estate exposure which are worth mentioning. When comparing our Texas exposure today to the 2008 downturn, there are several important factors that position us much more conservatively today. They include first, that our total commercial real estate balances are approximately 1.2 billion less today than they were going into 2008 and our exposure to land is down more than 80% from what we saw going into the previous cycle. Additionally, our mix of construction lending and CRE term lending has shifted much more to CRE term. Generally speaking, the amount of equity required in office and multifamily construction financing is almost double today what it was going into the previous cycle of 2008.","With that as a bit of a backdrop Paul I'll turn the call back over to you.","Paul Burdiss","Thank Scott. Slide 20 depicts our outlook for the next 12 months, relative to the most recent quarter. We are maintaining our slightly to moderately increasing outlook for loans, due primarily to factors already discussed earlier in our comments. Over the next four quarters, we expect net interest income to increase from the fourth quarter level. We anticipate continued loan and security growth and additional benefit from December's slight rate increase, which will outpace the headwinds of one fewer day of interest income and no anticipated large interest income recoveries.","Our outlook does not include the effective of any future rate increases by the Federal Reserve, although we expect to benefit to annual net interest income of about $100 million for every 100 basis point increase in short-term rates. We expect our quarterly provision that is moderately higher than the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming energy prices remain near current levels. We expect to maintain a strong reserve ratio on energy loans. We expect the non-interest income excluding dividends and securities gains and losses will increase slightly to moderately as we continue to focus heavily on this line items. As a reminder, if dividends from federal agencies namely the Federal Home Loan banks will decline due to a charter consolidation. You may recall we have multiple memberships to several Federal Home Loan banks and we're consolidating those to a single federal home loan bank and due to the FAST Act which is more commonly known as the Highway Spending Bill and its impact on dividends from the Federal Reserve.","Non-interest expense as stated previously and we are committed to holding the non-interest expense to less than $1.6 billion for 2016, excluding severance and restructuring costs. The effective tax rate for the quarter was about 4 basis points lower than our typical effective tax rate. This is due primarily to investment tax credits realized this quarter, relating to alternative energy and research and development. We expect our effective tax rate to be closer to 34% in 2016 which may fluctuate somewhat due to how much of our investment in technology projects is eligible for tax credits. We expect preferred dividends to continue to decline, the tender offer completed in the fourth quarter reduces preferred dividends by approximately $10 million annually, although the amounts are uneven. For example assuming no changes to the outstanding preferred equity from today, the first and third quarter dividend rates are expected to be 112, I'm sorry $12 million each and the second and fourth quarters should be approximately $15 million each.","This concludes our prepared remarks, Sabrina would you please open the line for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Jennifer Demba","Could you guys, it\u2019s a very healthy capital ratio. Just wondered if you have any interest in share repurchases once we get through CCAR given your stock has taken quite a hit in the last several weeks?","Harris Simmons","I would tell you that I would certainly expect so. We have not developed the capital plan that will accompany our submission of our stress test and through the CCAR process, which is just getting underway. But we would expect to be more aggressive than we\u2019ve been, certainly in the last cycle in terms of what we\u2019ll hope to accomplish in the way of capital returns. And that I expect that would be on the table, Jennifer, but obviously that\u2019s we are aboard to contemplate and determine in consultation with the management team here and then it goes through the CCAR process, but that\u2019s what I would sort of expect we will be doing.","Jennifer Demba","And just one additional question on the energy portfolio, Paul, could you just kind of elaborate how much of the reserve you guys have is qualitative versus quantitative for the energy portfolio?","Paul Burdiss","Well Jennifer, I think as you know that\u2019s not something that we typically disclose as Scott said, however we do believe we have a healthy reserve at over 5% of [bank] [ph] loans.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Milsaps of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Brad Milsaps","Scott, I was going to see if you give maybe a little more color on the pay downs that you did see in the energy book during the quarter. Just kind of what the nature of those were, are you starting to see any evidence of PE money, other energy companies buying out others, just trying to get a sense of kind of where the pay downs could go and where you\u2019re -- those are stemming from?","Scott McLean","Sure Brad, no, good question. Actually the pay downs are coming much more, they are more heavily weighted to the services portfolio, number one. Number two, you\u2019re going to see a natural contraction in the reserve base outstandings as the redetermination came down during the quarter. The borrowing bases were re-determined down we saw some natural payoffs there. But those would be the two primary areas. And we saw continued term amortization, recall that on the services side of our portfolio about 35% of the portfolio is term, it\u2019s amortizing on a little less than a five year basis. And so we\u2019re continuing to see reductions there. And then the last comment I would make is that during the year, we had approximately $140 million of capital contributed by private equity firms and that didn\u2019t all go to support reductions, but it, a portion of it did. And additionally, we saw about 150 million in loan commitments reduce as a result of restructurings that we did. So really it\u2019s across the board and it\u2019s all pretty healthy type reductions that you would anticipate.","Brad Milsaps","Okay. And then just one follow-up, I know you\u2019re using $30 per barrel to drive your charge-offs expectations for the year. Just curious kind of where you guys are in terms of your price deck in terms of and where you are for the redetermination numbers coming in at the end of the year?","Scott McLean","Yes, the current price deck is in the low-30s and then obviously it goes up from there. But the current low-end is about $32, our sensitivity case for 2016 drops down to $24, so that\u2019s -- we\u2019ve had about 11 price deck reductions over the last I\u2019d say 12 to 18 months.","Brad Milsaps","Great, thank you.","Scott McLean","And you\u2019d see the same sort of conservative nature on the natural gas pricing as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe","First question, just in terms of the investing of the cash into securities, could you just walk us through the thinking, like what changed in your minds, I mean, I know we had the rate hike, but it doesn\u2019t seem like security yields would have been all that much higher now versus say a month or five months ago? Why get more aggressive with security purchases? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, this is Paul. I assume when you say more aggressive, just there was a slight acceleration in the fourth quarter relative to what we\u2019ve seen previously, is that correct?","Ken Zerbe","I was thinking like the 1.6 billion that I think I saw referenced for the full year.","Paul Burdiss","Okay, yes. I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in saying that over the course of two to three years, we would be investing approximately $6 billion of cash into the investment portfolio. And the timing of that may change. So I wouldn\u2019t say that there was any particular view on the yield curve, but we are trying to be somewhat thoughtful about the timing of those investments. But looking forward I would expect to continue kind of in the range or the pace of the purchases that we have been making.","Scott McLean","I think it's also just fair to say that I mean we just continued to see growth in deposits, and particularly non-interest bearing deposits and so that\u2019s facilitated a little faster build up.","Ken Zerbe","And then just as the follow-up on Page 16 in terms of the energy loss expectations of 75 million to 100 million over the next four quarters, I know we\u2019ve been in the energy crisis I guess for some time. But just in terms of the path of losses, all right, we\u2019re talking about the losses over the next four quarters though with oil at $30 today, are we more likely going to be look into 2017, obviously we have the reserves build now, but are we more likely to see even higher losses in 2017, I am just trying to understand the default path of the energy companies?","Scott McLean","Ken, it\u2019s obviously very difficult to estimate what 2017 would look like. The price decline in the last month has been last 30 day has been very similar to last year, in terms of magnitude and we\u2019re obviously at a different level. And so all that pushed us to say that we would be at the upper-end of the range that we originally stated for 2016, and I think what you\u2019ll look for us what you can look for us to do is mid-year we\u2019ll have a better sense of how long this is going to last and what portion of the \u201917, but if, to answer your question very specifically, if prices did stay in this current level through 2017 you\u2019d probably see losses in \u201917 of about the same magnitude that we\u2019re suggesting for 2016.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining-Sparks. Your line is now open.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask you just about as you look at the discount that\u2019s kind of evolved into your stock price, I would say that you\u2019ll calculate the earnings power as a cushion for potential losses. And I just want to make sure I\u2019m getting this right. If we look at pre-tax on our earnings cushion, you have about 125 million per quarter and that would relate to about what you have right now in energy reserves, which represents 5% of the portfolio. So if you look at each quarter, you\u2019re generating in excess of another 5% before you would ever get into a capital, so be it kind of hit, to the capital position versus just reducing earnings. So, just wanted to you to kind of talk a little bit about earnings cushion and the potential losses in energy?","Scott McLean","I think you\u2019ve done a very nice job. I think first we start with a very strong capital and strong reserves, not only for energy but across the portfolio. And the rest of the portfolio continues to improve. I mean energy is the only place we\u2019re seeing stress. So, I think we feel like the risk of any real capital need, any external source of capital are going to be very it is just not on the horizon of anything we expect to happen at the present time.","Paul Burdiss","Well, in the guidance we gave on a 30 to 35 basis points of net charge-offs is again very manageable in the sense of our overall capital generation and that assumes a pretty pejorative outlook for the energy sector. So, you do have to -- once you move away from your analysis of energy, you have to look at how energy sits inside our total financial structure. And as you noted and Harris noted it, there is a lot of balance there.","Scott McLean","There is a lot incremental capital being generated each quarter just with the earnings power you have now. And then Paul the other I would find to really look at is before the stock price guidance to a discount, such a discount that it is now I thought dividends would be kind of the focus. But once you get this bigger gap, share repurchase becomes so valuable. Has the change in stock price changed the way you would just, not asking about the level that you\u2019ve asked for, but maybe your priority with share repurchase being a bigger priority now where the stock price is relative to maybe year-end?","Paul Burdiss","Again, it could well be -- I mean that\u2019s a yet to have with our Board, but I think we clearly recognize the power of repurchases right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR. Your line is now open.","Paul Miller","There was an OCC letter CRE exposure and worry -- I think the OCC was a little bit worried about some banks taking exposure there with that concern within are concerned, can you talk that a little bit about how you're dealing with that OCC letter and is it a big concern there at Zions?","Paul Burdiss","We\u2019ll have Michael Morris our Chief Credit Officer, speak to that. Michael?","Michael Morris","Sure, well the OCC letter focused a lot on multifamily and a lot on the buildup in community banks, especially in multifamily and we feel very comfortable with our multifamily exposure in all of the markets that we're in with the teams that we have in place, with the equity sponsors that we bank. Our average loan to cost in the construction site is around 60%-65%, so that translates into something less than that in LTV, so 55-60 LTV on projects that are still continuing to lease up and stabilize at rents that were either pro forma or in excessive pro forma. So where we see the pressure coming will be on cap rates as overall yields move up, if they do might not being the favorite asset class that it has been, so that could put some pressure on cap rates which would increase some of the value, but we're watching it carefully and we feel good about our exposure.","Paul Miller","And do you think Mike where your level of exposure in that area would it have to decline or it could stay where it is?","Michael Morris","We think it can stay where it is and go right into a cycle where there might be a little of softness in rent growth and cap rate increase, but we're comfortable where it is. We don't actually want it to pay-off and go out into the capital markets right into the agency side.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of American. Your line is now open.","Erika Najarian","My first question is a follow-up to Ken's. Paul you noted the rate of future securities purchases would be similar to what we've seen in the past, but I am calculating 1.5 on average for this quarter as you mentioned and then 6-10 in the previous quarter. Given that this such a powerful NII driver for you, it seems at which -- I just want to get it right, what should we assume for about the levels that of purchases per quarter?","Paul Burdiss","Yes Erica sorry if I misspoke, what I meant to say was that our purchases going forward would be in the range of what you'd experience so you kind of outlined the range of possibilities, but I would expect to continue to make purchases in that range for at least the next four quarters. And then hopefully they would be sort of somewhat reflective of the opportunity that the market gives us, but if we clearly understand the earnings power of those securities additions and are focused on continuing to deliver that. I should also say that those portfolio additions as I said in my slide comments, we're paying special attention to the duration of the bonds we\u2019re putting on and the extension risk. These are typically agency arms, an agency 10-year final maturity pass-throughs which again have we believe more predictable characteristic as it relates to the extension risk on those additions.","Erika Najarian","And if I could ask are those mostly HQLA and could remind us of what your LCR ratio is at the fourth quarter and how you\u2019d expected it to and how you're managing it for this year?","Paul Burdiss","Right Erica we're particularly mindful of the LCR and the securities that we're putting on we're adding in the context of HQLA, so either level 1 or level 2 in the appropriate proportions. I don't believe we disclosed our LCR, but I will say that we are comfortably in excess of the requirement.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joe Morford","Just wondered if you could give us a little more color to the drivers to the pick in the loan growth in the fourth quarter and any notable geographic trends you saw and related to that also just curious the run-off that you would expect to see in the national real estate portfolio in 2016?","Paul Burdiss","Sure, yes the growth during the quarter was -- we saw nice wonderful family mortgage growth across the entire franchise as our mortgage initiative is continuing to mature and we think that will continue into the New Year here and then with basically C&I growth just solid C&I growth above and beyond what is running off in the energy portfolio.","Joe Morford","And then the run-off?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, and Joe the nature of that C&I, those C&I balances, new balances, it is just normal kind of middle markets small business lending that we did\u2026","Joe Morford","Right.","Scott McLean","And I think if you look on Slide 26, there is a pretty good depiction by geography and types, you kind of see for this, now that's -- this is year-over-year -- but on the national's real estate it has been on 457 for the year it is -- that space of shrinkage has slowed. So we think we're getting closer to a point where that kind of starts to stabilize.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, by bank Joe, I would just add a little commentary the Zions bank was little right around the $75 million mark in growth from the prior quarter and California Bank & Trust actually had a really strong quarter at more than almost $220 million worth of growth, energy had good growth, obviously not in C&I because of the nature of the energy portfolio there but in the other categories, it was a good quarter there. So in Arizona like $100 million growth there, it\u2019s just a really diversified growth.","Joe Morford","And then maybe just a couple of quick housekeeping things, I wondered if you could just in the expense categories just quantify what the litigation accruals for this quarter as well as for those fees paid out on the DIC investment IPO?","Paul Burdiss","We're not going to give you a disaggregation of it impart because we -- it's -- the litigation is ongoing and it's useful stuff not to have to signal what that is in a granular way, so someday we'll come back and answer your question but not right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Geoffrey Elliott","I wondered if you could talk about credit, ex-energy and how long you think the positive trends that you are seeing there can continue?","Paul Burdiss","Well I mean, I guess the short answer is until we see the non-energy economies start to really fray, but we're not seeing that we -- and I don't think we're going to venture a guess as to when the cycle really starts to et cetera, we'll actually do that but I think suffice to say that at the moment we continue to see improvement and even in markets like, in a market like Texas the non-energy portfolio remains very healthy. We are looking at a lot of indicators in each of those portfolios to kind of watching for problems and so far it is not really showing up. So, anything Michael you would add to that?","Michael Morris","No, I can't add anything to that, all domains consumer, retail, mortgage, small business, large commercial they all continue to perform well and metrics are all solid.","James Abbott","Geoff this is James.","Geoffrey Elliott","Sorry?","James Abbott","Geoff I was just going to direct you to maybe the Appendix Slide 25 and this might be helpful for you. As you look at -- we haven't broken out a lot of information on past loans grade migration in the past but this is a little bit of the FICO score analysis of what's happening both in -- what we've turned as the high oil and gas employment counties, we're going to create a new acronym here, but -- and then everything else and so this is in our consumer book but you can maybe think about this in terms of how consumers are behaving versus small business which is the bread and butter or a bread and butter business for Zions, but you can kind of see the -- at every point from the year ago period, you are not seeing deterioration of any statistical significance in the consumer book and that's the same story that you'd see if you looked at our small business portfolio and middle market portfolios.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin","Just a couple of more clarifications on credit, so just understanding if the outlook for charge-offs is 30 to 35 basis points, because I calculate that's around 120 million to 145 million or so of charge-offs, and I am just wondering on top of that are you also saying that you'll provide for some loan growth and then is there also potential for additional reserve build, if there is additional deterioration in the energy credits as you mentioned on the slide?","Paul Burdiss","Actually we believe with the provision that we've guided you towards that that should fully cover this level of charge-offs and growth in the portfolio.","Ken Usdin","Okay, so\u2026","Harris Simmons","Well again there is quite an assumption there again the quality and the rest of portfolio remains as strong as it is currently or even continues to improve a little bit but.","Ken Usdin","Yes, that's why I asked the question because it just seems like if you're saying a 75 to 100 of energy losses than it would seem that you have got about 45 million from other sectors but I'm just trying to understand that breakdown of the reserve bill, the loan growth and then it doesn't seem like to your answer on prior question it doesn't seem like you're seeing much elsewhere as far as lost contents. I was wondering if it was just a summary of those other things and maybe the absence of recoveries?","Harris Simmons","Yes I guess the other thing what I would probably add is if we saw loan growth and the resets kind of slight to moderate, and clearly as loan growth surprises the upside that would probably push the provision a little bit higher too. So it's -- this anticipates pretty modest loan growth in getting to that kind of a number.","Ken Usdin","And just a quick follow-up on the fee side, this quarter obviously you had the -- it looks like you had some write-downs in the loan sales line but can you also help us understand how much the impact is of the highway bill and the charter consolidation and did that all show up in fees as well?","Paul Burdiss","Well, yes the point that I was making this is Paul, around the outlook for non-interest income was that these sources of dividends in the past were not going to be there going forward and so for example on Federal Reserve bank stock there's about a $3 million differential there in 2016 relative to 2015 and in federal home loan bank stock it\u2019s kind of in the $5 million to $7 million range. So you're looking at in the aggregate about $10 million of reduced dividends from those sources in '16 versus '15.","Ken Usdin","And then just should we start from the 124 reported as the base to grow up slightly to moderately increasing?","Paul Burdiss","I would say there were a couple of items in there as you correctly pointed out in your question that averaged the impact of that. I think the right base is probably closer to the third quarter number which is kind of in the 130 range.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Kevin Barker","Given that the -- some of the securities buyings that you've done over the last couple of quarters and your expectations over the next several quarters, where do you see your asset sensitivity on 100 and 200 basis point move once you fully complete some of the balance sheet restructuring over the next give it a year or two?","Paul Burdiss","Yes, this is Paul, my expectation is that given our starting point which was as you know we screen very high asset sensitivity, even after taking into consideration the fixed rate asset purchases that we contemplate here over the next year or so, my expectation is that while our asset sensitivity will be reduced we will have converted all of that sort of potential income into actual income. And we will still screen in my opinion on the high-end of asset sensitivity relative to our peers.","Kevin Barker","When you say high-end do you have an idea of 200 basis point move will be x percentage or 100 basis point move would be, 4% to 6%?","Paul Burdiss","We haven't quantified that, and maybe James and I can work together to figure out what might make sense, but I think if you look at the spread of asset sensitivity around the peers as I said we're still going to be at the high-end of that.","Kevin Barker","And then you mentioned that the price decks for oil were down at $32 and the stressed impact was I believe you mentioned $24 in your earlier comments. At that level and if we were to see oil near $24 for the next year or two, do you quantify or have some stress impact for energy losses in that scenario?","Paul Burdiss","We actually have four models that we're utilizing at the moment and they cover the full gamut from $20 a barrel up to higher levels and the guidance we're giving for this year fully reflects the potential of a $20 scenario.","Kevin Barker","Okay.","Paul Burdiss","Which we don't anticipate to happen by the way, but you can't help but study it at that level because we just have a very serious approach to this whole subject.","Kevin Barker","Yes, so we don't get there, all right thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari","Wanted to see if you could just on the oil price sensitivity wanted to see if you can give us what the sensitivity will be if oil was at $20 by the end of '16 and I'm not just asking that just to have you extrapolate, but I understand that it may not be asymmetrical relationship, it might get much worse as prices fall into the 20s and stay there, so just wanted see if you can help us size that up? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","You know I appreciate the question, but we are -- it is really is a moving target, we\u2019re not going to sort of disclose each one of our scenarios, but suffice it to say that we have evaluated at that level from multiple different approaches. And we believe that again what we\u2019ve forecasted would be well in the range of lower prices.","Harris Simmons","And I think the question is there going to be a complete cliff in that process and?","Scott McLean","There is generally not a complete cliff. I mean the nice thing about the reserve based lending. Is that it is unlike any other type of commercial lending we do, it is made to adjust on a periodic basis. And it works far better than working capital revolvers, receivables and inventory. And the industry E&P companies, they know how to live within their cash flows generally speaking is doesn\u2019t mean they encounter problems, they will encounter problems. But they know how to ratchet back cash flow and it\u2019s fundamentally comes in the form of controlling their CapEx. But they have many other things to control including the cost that they receive from services companies, which are down anywhere from 25% to 35% in 2016. The other thing as you have probably read about is that just lifting cost, pure cash lifting cost. Depending on the company, depending on the reservoir et cetera, et cetera are generally in the $7 to $12 range, pure cash lifting cost. So there is a lot of datapoints to what I just described to you, but because these revolvers are -- the borrowing bases are re-determined every six months through comprehensive engineering we -- they adjust very naturally, so you rarely run into a pure brick wall.","John Pancari","My follow-up is on the commercial real estate portfolio on a linked-quarter basis, the term CRE book was up 4.5%. The first time in a while, you have put out that type of growth in that book. Is that something that is sticky and could you see it continue the growth at that pace or I was just wondering what\u2019s changed that you feel comfortable growing that? Thanks.","Michael Morris","This is Michael. I would say that without really digging into the number, that while that growth came from conversion from construction to term. And when that happens it\u2019s a lot easier for that to stick to the books and a lot of easier for us to write near term than it is to go out and originate fresh near-term loans that may not have the kind of risk profile that we want. So we have really put the decelerator on C&D, especially in the multi-family. So a lot of that would be conversion to term, but some of the business units are originating new term. So if we can continue to create a more stabilized CRE portfolio with stabilized income streams.","John Pancari","But I guess Paul, I guess from your perspective from the risk weighting that is applied to commercial real estate exposure and everything. I mean does this imply that you\u2019re more comfortable with the exposure now, as it pertains to your capital ramifications or well that is what I am just trying to get at?","Paul Burdiss","Well, first don\u2019t think we have plenty of capital. But importantly as Michael said, I think what we\u2019re seeing here is a conversion of construction into term CRE. So in the aggregate, I\u2019m not sure that the exit loss profile looks any worse.","Michael Morris","And I think it is notable, but I mean if you look at construction, it\u2019s flat over the last year, I mean it came up a little bit, came back down. And total CRE is up 2.3% or something like that. I mean so it is -- I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate from one quarter on the CRE fees.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Thank you.","James Abbott","Sabrina, we\u2019ve got about five questions left. We\u2019ll have to go to the one question per questioner at this point just to try to, we're already overdue so we are going to try to go through this quickly though.","Operator","Sounds, good. Our next question comes from the line of David Darst of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","David Darst","So on the 400 million that you had as loss absorbing capacity in the CCAR with CDOs, is there any risk that are in the upcoming CCAR that\u2019s not enough, kind of curious stress level for the energy book?","Scott McLean","Well, it is -- I mean the nature of Fed Reserves models as if you don\u2019t really know. I mean we would certainly expect that there would be nominal if any loss showing in the securities portfolio just around at CCAR. And so I think you are thinking about it may be right way, I mean you sort of have $400 million that you could move to another column to C&I for energy for example. But we obviously don\u2019t know, so at the moment we don\u2019t know what the scenario is going to look like it hasn\u2019t been distributed yet and we don\u2019t know how their models work. So I think it would be speculative on our part to say that we have any better understanding than you probably do about what\u2019s going to come out of that model.","Paul Burdiss","Although, this is Paul, I\u2019ll remind you that the operative capital statistic last year was Tier 1 common and the operative statistics this is year is common equity Tier 1. And under the fed\u2019s model last year, we fared much better under the current measure than the former measure.","David Darst","All right.","Scott McLean","And should show a strong level of pre-tax pre-provision net revenue as well coming in, so a better starting point in that way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steven Alexopoulos","So my one question is for Scott. Could you give us a sense, what percent of production for your E&P customers which was hedged in 2015, and at what level? And then how is that changing into 2016, both percent hedge and then the new level it will be hedged at? Thanks.","Scott McLean","Sure, so the -- let me just sort of give you a broad sense of this. That in -- last year, we indicated that a year ago that generally speaking oil was hedged at around 55% of the current year production and that number is probably about two-thirds of that now for current year production, half to two-thirds. And it\u2019d be similar for gas, the amount of gas hedging was a little less last year than the 55% plus or minus for oil in terms of -- and I am talking about current year production, so it would have been 2015 production, now we\u2019re in 2016, and I am saying that those hedging levels are probably about half of what they were in -- for the 2015 year. And I would also tell you that the way that the borrowing base redeterminations work that is fully taken into account. So, if it doesn\u2019t stop the decline in the borrowing bases, but it's fully taken into account in terms of the present value of the future cash flows.","Steven Alexopoulos","And what about the level in terms of where it's hedged at for 2016?","Scott McLean","The dollar amount?","Steven Alexopoulos","Yes, on average?","Scott McLean","So yes, I don\u2019t have that number, I apologize. Let me go back and see what we said last year, I don\u2019t have that dollar amount. And I don\u2019t -- yes we\u2019ll just take a look back at it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Eads of UBS. Your line is now open.","David Eads","A big part of my question John had and I think more from a qualitative standpoint than a quantitative standpoint, just curious if we\u2019ve seen some bankruptcies failed to recently and I know that every borrower is very-very different. But I am just curious if what have we seen recently would cause any reason to change your expectations when it comes to loss severities when you do see evolve?","Scott McLean","On the energy portfolio?","David Eads","Yes, yes.","Scott McLean","Yes. Again these four models that we use are pretty aggressive in terms of the negative assumptions that we use or the very conservative assumptions that we use. So, we believe we have baked that in. I mean it was very different list of assumptions this year than last year and the way we\u2019ve refined our models has been especially helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy of Stephens. Your line is now open.","Terry McEvoy","Just a quick question, I was wondering if you performed the goodwill impairment evaluation last quarter, last year you did it in October. The reason I ask is about 60% of your billing dollars of goodwill is connected to Amegy?","Paul Burdiss","Yes this is Paul. In accordance with GAAP, we are required as you know to continually monitor the valuation of the relative components of that relative to goodwill. So, yes in fact we have dutifully performed that in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Brian Klock of Keefe, Bruyette and Woods. Your line is now open.","Brian Klock","So, I\u2019ll save my other questions for the Investor Day in a couple of weeks. But maybe ask another way, so on Page 11 in the income statement the other non-interest expense line item. Obviously, there are some things in there that appear to be non-recurring. How should we think about it sort of normalized level for that? Should it be some sort of maybe the average of the last three quarters or so, or I mean how should we think about what is a normal level for that line item?","James Abbott","Yes Brian, this is James. I think that if you looked at the third quarter\u2019s other non-interest expense line item and use that as a guide, that\u2019s probably a reasonable expectation.","Brian Klock","Okay thank you for your help.","Paul Burdiss","Than our normal quarter than this quarter.","James Abbott","Right, Brian at this level I agree with that.","James Abbott","Okay, thank you very much everyone for joining the call today. Thank you, Sabrina for hosting and we appreciate all of your attendance. Please feel free to send additional questions to me and we'll try to get back to you as within a reasonable period of time tomorrow for sure.

First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to James Abbott.","James R. Abbott","Thank you, Jamie, and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our first quarter 2013 earnings. Our primary participants today will be Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Doyle Arnold, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the earnings release is available at zionsbancorporation.com. We intend to limit the length of this call to 1 hour which will include time for you to ask questions. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your questions to 1 primary and 1 related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","I will now turn the time over to Harris Simmons.","Harris H. Simmons","Thanks very much, James, and we want to welcome all of you to the call this afternoon. We are generally quite pleased with the first quarter results that you've all seen. Many of the trends were strong either on a relative basis such as loan growth on an absolute basis such as net charge-offs. Net charge-offs ratio this quarter, as we look around, looks like it's among the lowest in the industry.","Additionally, we received, during the quarter, permission from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the majority of our numerous requests to improve our capital structure and cost. We've already announced the call of the Series B Trust preferred stock and we'll announce further actions imminently. We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue to improve our return on equity in 2013, as these actions are executed and they should reduce the cost of our capital and financing structure in material ways.","Finally, last week, we announced an increase in our dividend to an annualized $0.16 per share from $0.04 per share. We've indicated to investors in the past that while our primary goal is to use capital generation to reduce high cost capital, we hope to modestly increase the dividend and so we've now begun that process.","Let me touch upon a couple of fundamental highlights for the quarter. First, with respect to loan growth and net interest income, loan growth in the first quarter is typically a little weaker than in other quarters. We tried to be very transparent about what we were seeing as we went through the quarter, indicating that loans have declined by more than $100 million in early January. March was a strong month, pulling the company to a positive $148 million for the quarter as reported in our earnings release. I say strong, at least relative to what you're seeing from some other banks, I guess, these days. Our lenders report to us that they remain positive about loan growth prospects, pipelines generally remain pretty strong. Commercial customers seem to be generally more optimistic than they were 6 months ago and production volume was up 14% in the first quarter of 2013, compared to what we saw in the same quarter a year ago.","However, as I noted in the press release, we saw further pricing pressure on loans. Beginning in February and continuing in March, some of the nation's largest banks cut prices on most loan types in most of our markets. Pricing had been fairly stable for most of 2012, at least on middle-market loans. But if this pricing pressure continues, it will likely result in roughly stable net interest income in 2013, despite our expectations for continued loan growth, which we had hoped would translate into positive growth and net interest income.","Those of you who follow us closely know we think a lot about convexity. And while it's unclear when interest rates will rise, we are one of a very limited number of banks that are significantly asset-sensitive. Not only do we expect earnings to increase when rates rise, we expect to be able to avoid the significant haircut to equity that many banks may likely experience due to their heavy concentrations of mortgage-backed securities. As you know, we have virtually no exposure to that type of product.","In the credit quality front, as I said, we continue to be pleased with credit loss performance. In the release, press release, we noted the continued improvement in gross charge-offs, although net charge-offs also declined because recoveries are volatile at this point in the cycle. We're watching gross charge-offs carefully. Our annualized net charge-off ratio was only 19 basis points during the quarter. We're very happy with that. Our nonperforming asset ratio expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned declined at a continued strong rate and we expect to see further general improvement in that ratio in the quarters ahead.","Finally, a note about capital, I'd highlight the fact that our Tier 1 Common capital ratio climbed above 10%, which was a nice milestone.","And with that overview, I'm going to ask Doyle Arnold to review the quarterly financial performance in a little more detail. Doyle?","Doyle L. Arnold","Thank you, Harris. Good evening, everybody. Starting off with a brief overview, as noted in the release, we posted net income applicable to common shareholders of $88.3 million or $0.48 per diluted common share for the quarter. That compares to $0.19 per share in the prior quarter. A couple of significant items are worth pointing out that tend to really move the needle on the EPS number from quarter-to-quarter. For the first quarter, the one we're reporting on today, the provision for credit losses was a negative $35 million, even though we are maintaining our conservative posture on reserving for credit losses. Even so, we reduced the provision or reduced the ALLL with the provision of minus $29 million, and the provision for unfunded lending commitments came down by $6 million. Together, the $35 million total, we've added about $0.12 per share to earnings compared to prior quarter's negative $9 million ACL, which would have been about $0.03 a share.","Additionally, securities gains and losses for the quarter, including OTTI, netted to a loss of only about $4 million this quarter or $0.01 a share compared to the prior quarter's net loss of $74 million or $0.25 a share from securities-related charges. Combined, these 2 groups account for about $0.33 per share improvement compared to the prior quarter with a partial offset due to a decline in net interest income. The net interest income decline largely was attributable to a reduced day count in the first quarter compared to the fourth.","Now turning to some of the individual drivers of the results. I'll begin with the revenue drivers. Average loans increased $413 million compared to the fourth quarter of last year, a bit over 1% quarter-over-quarter. We pay a bit more attention to average loans because of the variability with end-of-period loan balances and it's the number that actually drives earnings. But I note that end-of-period loan balances increased $148 million, including FDIC-supported loans and loans held for sale.","We saw the usual rundown right after year end in loans but then it stabilized by the end of January, and then a lot of this loan growth came from late February till the end of the quarter. And as Harris noted, we've tried to keep you up-to-date as the quarter went on. I will note that the loan growth thus far has continued in the first 3 weeks of April up through last Friday.","Let me draw your attention to the loan table on Page 10 of the release. Commercial and industrial loans do tend to have some seasonal trends and while they grew nearly 4% in the fourth quarter, the growth slowed in the first quarter to a rate of 2%. Note that the loan portfolio in the first quarter a year ago actually shrank at a rate of nearly 2%. So this was quite a favorable swing, with which we are pleased.","The growth was predominantly in Texas, California, and to a modest degree, in Utah. Line utilization rates on revolving C&I do remain pretty weak. And in fact, they declined further to 31.8% compared to 33.1% at the end of the fourth quarter. As has been mentioned in some of the earnings calls by other banks, we've, as Harris noted, have seen some evidence of reemergence of pricing pressure this quarter. We noticed  this most particularly on larger loans. On the smaller loans, the pricing, while under a little bit pressure, is holding up better.","Turning to construction and development loans, these increased by about $100 million or 5% sequentially. As we discussed previously, both in IR meetings and in previous quarterly calls, new construction commitments have been fairly strong for several quarters, as we increased our exposure to commercial construction projects when pricing terms and covenants have been some of the best our bankers have seen in their careers. These loans are now beginning to get into the funding stage after the equity has gone into the project. Because there's still a large significant amount of outstanding unfunded commitments in this category, we expect outstanding balances to continue to grow in 2013. However, because of concentration limits that we've adopted as part of our portfolio risk management, we are being disciplined about the new loans we make. And in fact, our commitments declined in the first quarter, after 5 consecutive quarters of expansion. And this pullback also coincides with the general softening in pricing terms and covenants as we observed some others getting more aggressive.","Term CRE declined at 5 of our banks during the quarter, leading to the decline in the overall balance of just over $50 million. This was primarily driven by elevated prepayments, new production volume remains healthy and was one of the few types to see an increase in production compared to the fourth quarter.","After several strong quarters, consumer lending declined slightly due partly to seasonal factors in home equity and credit cards but we do expect to see further growth in the year from this category broadly defined.","Residential mortgage, mortgages increased by $60 million or 1.3%, and that's a better first quarter performance than the year-ago period which declined by 1.1%.","If you want to turn to Page 14, now we'll discuss the margin and net interest income. The NIM declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter. One of the smaller declines we've had lately. The securities yields declined in part due to fewer dollars of -- we'll call them catch-up payments on CDOs. In other words, when banks that are behind on interest payments come current, there's a bump in yield during that quarter. We do expect such catch-up payments to continue as we still have exposure to just over 180 banks that are still deferring. Parenthetically, that's down from about 270 at the peak. Of the remaining 180 odd, there are about 2\/3 of those who are well-capitalized and profitable. So we expect more deferring banks, not all of them certainly, but more of them to continue to come current over future quarters. But the quarterly rate is likely to vary and be somewhat unpredictable. Therefore, there will be a little bit of volatility associated with the securities yield for the next number of quarters.","Additional pressure on securities yield can be ascribed to accelerated premium amortization on certain SBA loans. Combined, these changes have an impact of about 50 basis points to the portfolio. The decline in such yields looks fairly significant but because the securities are such a small percentage of the overall earning asset base, the decline pressured the NIM by only about 3 basis points.","Other factors impacting the NIM included an increase in income from FDIC-covered loans due to faster prepayments than previously modeled, and a decline in cash-earning assets.","Net interest income declined by about $12 million sequentially, although 3\/4 of that decline is attributable to the usual seasonality, that is the reduced day count in the first quarter. Second quarter net interest income will be positively impacted by 1 extra day of interest, plus about $4 million less interest from the Series B Trust-preferred shares that we have announced. It's being called as of May 3. We also, as I've mentioned, anticipate some continued loan growth this quarter, although the effects of that will be somewhat offset by pricing pressure.","Turning to noninterest income, which you can find back on the income statement, Page 9, I believe it is. Yes. The noninterest income benefited by a significantly lower amount of OTTI on CDOs, but we still experienced some on a default of a single security during the quarter. However, we also saw an improvement in the AOCI mark which would -- shows up on the balance sheet by nearly $40 million after tax, which resulted primarily from another improvement and credit risk spreads that we observed in the few trades that took place.","Compared to a year ago now, the AOCI has improved by approximately $170 million, primarily again due to the improvement in CDO valuations. As noted, trading, however, remains very light and the quarterly change in the AOCI is likely to remain volatile until real liquidity returns to the market. Fairly minor item but for those of you trying to keep your models taken down nicely, the other noninterest income line increased by about $3 million from the prior quarter, which is essentially a credit recovery from an FDIC-insured asset, though we would not expect that to be a run rate item going forward.","If you want to turn to Pages 11 and 12, talk a little more about credit. As Harris commented, we've continued to see a strong improvement in credit quality including nonperforming assets and gross charge-offs. As a result, our credit loss model indicated a negative provision driven by several things. Loss severity on classified loans, one of the most significant drivers of the model, improved by 14% compared to year end. The term CRE loss severity improved by an even stronger 24%. Nonaccrual inflows declined by more than 40% from the prior quarter, to approximately $400 million annualized run rate, which compares favorably to the actual balance of $589 million at quarter end. OREO inflows also declined significantly by about 40%, to an annualized rate of $75 million. And favorable resolutions hit a new high of 74% of total resolution.","So in short, we're seeing both improvements in both the sort of the volume of problem loans, the inflows of new problem loans, the resolution of problems and a reduction in the loss severity in problems. But otherwise, things are really bad. Just kidding. I mean, the credit quality continues to churn along nicely.","A comment on capital. Harris already mentioned the Tier 1 Common Ratio which, on a Basel I basis, increased to 10.06%. The GAAP tangible common equity also increased strongly to about 7.5% from 7.1% in the prior quarter, driven not only by the retained earnings but by the improvement in the AOCI mark and the reduction in the denominator. That is in total tangible assets due to the runoff of some of the cash that was deployed at year end due to the -- and runoff of deposits.","With that, we'll stop talking about the last quarter and try to give you, as we usually do, a little guidance about the next few quarters. Loan growth. We observed continued strength in loan pipelines in many parts of the franchise. We've have an increase in commitments in the last 6 months. And know that our commercial customers are reporting somewhat more optimistic outlook. Therefore, I think we expect continued moderate loan growth over the coming years. And as I noted, we've continued to have loan growth in the first 3 weeks of the current, that is the second quarter.","Net interest income, we expect to be relatively stable, at least in the next few months. This outlook does not contemplate accelerated discount amortization or unusual items, just the kind of the run rate of net interest income. Noninterest income, we expect the less volatile components of noninterest income such as service fees to continue a modest upward trend. If we had unusual items related to investment banking, things calling -- tendering for debt, calling securities, et cetera, those one-time items are not included in that outlook. But again, the core drivers on an ongoing basis should continue to improve.","Turning to noninterest expense, salaries and benefits are likely to taper down somewhat during the year due to the usual seasonal factors, social security payments and things like that in the first quarter, which tend to decline through the rest of the year. We also expect continued improvement in credit-related noninterest expenses and FDIC premiums. We expect the FDIC indemnification asset, this is the asset related to loans acquired and acquisitions of failed banks back in 2009. We expect that asset to continue for about another year at material levels although perhaps not as great as the first quarter's $20 million. After that, the other noninterest expense line should run into the area of $60 million a quarter. Therefore, while there's some moving pieces, we expect expenses to remain stable or possibly continue to improve slightly.","Provision for credit losses. We expect the provision expense to remain low or even negative over the next several quarters, barring some change in the economic outlook. Continued reduction in problem credits and the ongoing improvement in loss severity rates have the potential to result in a negative premium in future quarters as it was in the last couple of quarters, although loan growth will moderate this to some degree. Preferred stock dividends will increase in the second and third quarters as we begin accruing for the Series G shares that we issued a couple of months ago. We expect that dividend in the second quarter to be about $27 million, and we expect to issue additional preferred stock in the next few weeks and months, so there could be a further increase in the third quarter as well. Excluding the effect of any call of the Series C preferred shares, which are callable, I believe it's September 15. And if that call is completed, we would expect then preferred dividends to drop materially in the fourth quarter.","With that, I think we will give you, ladies and gentlemen, a moment to queue up your questions. And then, operator, we'll start responding to those questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Josh Levin from Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'd like to ask for some more of your thoughts and details on the competitive landscape. You said it was the larger banks who are being more aggressive on pricing structure for loans. Why do you think that's the case? Do larger banks have a cost advantage relative to the midsized banks? Or are they more desperate? Or something else altogether?","Harris H. Simmons","Desperate. You're not going to draw us into that cost advantage.","James R. Abbott","And how much extra capital they have to hold.","Doyle L. Arnold","The answer is, I mean, that's -- I understand that the big banks are blaming the small banks for this and the regional banks like us are blaming the big banks. We're, of course, right. But I can only speculate. I do note that the mortgage-related activity is a really big deal for several of the -- at least of the very largest banks and it's pretty well-known that the refi boom was a very large source of earnings for those banks last year and that, that party is ending pretty rapidly. So I would speculate that looking anywhere and everywhere, I probably would be too, to replace that. And that means any loan type other than mortgages as a place to go. But beyond that, I can't speculate. I don't know if you got any other color, James, on...","James R. Abbott","Well, Josh, I would just add that we -- that the area that we saw the most decline in our production was on the larger credits and that's -- we had heard that the larger banks, the big 4, had been very stable for the past 9 months or so and we started hearing in February, March timeframe, that there was a renewed level of competition. We started seeing it in our own production numbers as well. So there was some competitive pricing pressure on the small loans that we've originated. It's 5 basis points or so, 10 basis points compared to the prior quarter. But on the larger deals, it's been closer to 25 basis points of pressure.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And a separate question. You noted that you're very asset-sensitive. Obviously, you have a lot of deposits right now. When you think about your asset sensitivity and you model it, how are you assuming deposits behave in terms of how quickly they would run off the balance sheet or how much of a rise in rates you'd have to pass through on the deposit side?","Doyle L. Arnold","We've -- I mean, that's probably more time -- a longer discussion than we have time for here. In our IR roadshows and in our 10-K and Q, we tried to describe that. But we have basically incorporated into our analysis, something like $8 billion of deposits running off and\/or being replaced with current market rate funds in a rising rate environment. And the asset sensitivity that we're reporting is after incorporating that kind of assumption.","James R. Abbott","That's just the DDA.","Doyle L. Arnold","That's just on the -- yes. So you want to amplify it briefly, James, without getting to the whole thing?","James R. Abbott","I mean, we have a -- I think, without getting into all kinds of assumptions within the model, it's probably not an apples-to-apples comparison to what's being disclosed in the industry but...","Doyle L. Arnold","Is there a specific -- I'll give you one chance to ask a specific question about that, and then we probably ought to move on to another question. Josh, is there one particular point you want to ask us about?","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe I'll follow up with James offline later.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","If we dig a little deeper on the competition point here, and I'm wondering, can we isolate the impact from the floor run off from the changes in rates and also the competitive pressures you're seeing? So I'm really looking for, out of the 11 basis points of consolidated loan yield decline sequentially, what roughly came from the removal of floors?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I think, most of the decline, you would have -- of the 11 basis points that you would've seen in the first quarter had nothing to do with the pricing on new loans because it takes a while for just new loan pricing to move the needle on close to $40 billion of existing loans. So most of that 11 basis points is the result of the things we've talked about previously. And the 2 are, one you've already mentioned, the floors, the expiry and inability to replace in the money floors and that has been running at about 4 or 5 basis points a quarter. Although we haven't tried to do that calculation on the first quarter yet specifically, but I think it's about the same. And the other is the rate reset on 5-year reset loans that were made in -- now in 2008. But we had -- as we've talked about a number of times, kind of in the late 2006 through the first half of 2008 before the collapse, we had a pretty peak -- well, we had peak volume of origination of owner-occupied commercial loans with 5-year resets, and those are all now resetting at a 150-odd basis points below. The spreads are the same, rates have just come down. So we're -- and that's another 5 basis points or so. Those probably are the 2 pressures that drove this quarter. The rate reset, we should be tapering off on the end of money floors. The rate resets probably have one more quarter. But again in the third quarter, loan volume of that type of loan really dropped third quarter of 2008. So we should be getting near the end of that period. But we're just kind of telegraphing to you that if this pricing pressure continues, it will start to have an incremental effect on the margin in future quarters. But I don't think it had much this quarter.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's helpful, Doyle. And then last quarter in your marketing handout, you put out this nice slide, which showed spread on new business, and the point was really spreads have stabilized really since 2011. Given your updated comments today and increased competition from larger banks, when you update this again and you show March and April, do you think we'll see a sort of a slide-down kind of below that stabilization point?","Doyle L. Arnold","Have we got it updated yet? No. I've -- that may -- we haven't actually gotten it done yet, but it wouldn't surprise me if it comes down a bit.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And just one more. Is there an impact from the interest rates swap portfolio? I forget if there's -- how that impacts the NIM here.","Doyle L. Arnold","They've all matured.","Harris H. Simmons","Are you just talking about our hedges of swapping...","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The pre-fixed [ph] pay float protecting C&I yield. That's all gone, right?","Doyle L. Arnold","Those are almost all gone. There's almost no impact.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Actually, I have a quick follow-up to Craig's question. Last quarter on the conference call, you guys mentioned that you thought 2% to 3% loan growth for the year would be sort of enough to offset whatever you thought NIM is going to do in the year. With the move down in loan rate, do you think that, that growth rate would need to be a little bit higher or can you give me some more color on that?","Doyle L. Arnold","That was pre this emergence of pricing pressure. So we haven't tried to recalculate it, but it might take a little more than that to offset it if -- for the year. Maybe I -- what we were saying last year was that it'd probably take $400 million to $500 million to offset the known sources of pressure per quarter. What we said earlier this year, it was probably down to $200 million to $300 million. We may be back up by a couple of hundred million over that. But good news is it's -- so far, at least, it looks like loan growth maybe a little more robust this year than last year when -- as well. That's kind of why we're saying maybe that the net interest income outlook is roughly stable.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And just one quick follow-up. Have you guys sort of started to see any further stabilization in pricing since the quarter ended?","Harris H. Simmons","Not today. No, I mean, no, we haven't gone back out. I mean, this information was as of kind a couple of weeks ago, I think when James does a series of internal calls. And we don't update it like weekly.","James R. Abbott","Yes. And, Thomas, I would just add on the net interest income line item, I'm not commenting on margin specifically, but net interest income, we'll have an extra day of interest income for the second quarter plus we will have called this Series B Trust Preferred Securities, which is helpful in the net interest income by about almost $4 million. So you combine those 2, and that should help offset some of the pressures that we'll naturally feel on that line item in the second quarter from competitive pricing.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Foran from Autonomous Research.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","The NIIs, so I guess to start there, you're stable from this quarter or the relatively stable guidance is from this quarter or full year to full year?","Doyle L. Arnold","Kind of from this quarter.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And then on credit, I mean just as charge-offs continue to come down, as the non-accruals, inflows kind of collapse, any kind of framework we should think about for where both reserves to loans as well as your unfunded commitment could go to over time?","Doyle L. Arnold","Very hard to say. I mean I think -- all I could tell you is we're going to maintain our, I think, our posture of being as conservative as we can. And GAAP limits are -- places limitations on our ability to be conservative. We're not trying to milk the reserve from earnings; quite the opposite. But the facts are leading to a decline, and I can't point you -- if you're asking me, do we have a target, ALLL ratio, the answer is no, we don't. And that's the best I can do for you.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And maybe another way to ask it would be, I appreciate that you've got the kind of dual  pressures, but some of your peers have already gone much lower still. Is there any reason structurally you would expect over several years, you would be a step change higher than peers or is there just potentially timing differences between you and the industry?","Doyle L. Arnold","I mean, there are some structural issues. But I mean, a lot of it will be just timing. But a lot of heavily -- consumer lenders only reserve maybe a year's worth of charge-offs as a convention and for that part of the business. And whereas for C&I and commercial real estate, we really try to look at the whole loss emergence period, and -- which is may be closer to 2 years or even beyond in today's environment. So the fact that we're 80% commercially oriented broadly speaking and less than 20% consumer, whereas some others are much heavier consumer would lead some others to have a lower reserve ratio than us permanently. But not if -- I wouldn't think so if you adjust for composition.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","If I could sneak one last one last in, can you just remind us where the CDO swap stands and what the decision tree is around potentially moving that at some point -- removing that at some point in the future?","Doyle L. Arnold","It's still in place. It costs about $5 million a quarter pretax. It has the effect of reducing the risk weighting on the assets that it covers from about 400% on average to 20%. And the net effect of that is a several-billion-dollar reduction in risk weightings. When we put it on, that effect was about $4.3 billion or $4.4 billion, as I recall, due to both OTTI, but also paydowns and other things that changed the underlying risk weighting. And the -- if the TRS weren't there, that $4.4 billion is down to about $3 billion today, and we would expect it to continue to decline. So the mitigating effect on risk-weighted assets has gone from about 10% down to about 7% and continues to decline. There will be a time when therefore taking it off doesn't result in much increase in risk-weighted capital ratios. And that's kind of -- that's sort of the decision tree, is when is that number and -- down to the -- a low-enough level that we don't look out of line with other banks and things like that if we would just take it off. And so it is something we continue to debate. But the fact that we're still there means no decision has been made yet other than to continue for at least another quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Gaston Ceron from Morningstar Equity.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just very quickly here, a little new to the story. I was interested in your comments regarding your increased exposure to commercial construction projects. You're talking about covenants. I'm -- I'd be curious if you could give any additional color on how you're screening these products as they come in. I mean you say that the covenants look pretty good from your perspective. I'm curious how you're screening these -- the demand for these products as they come in just to make sure that, obviously, that your portfolio remains as sound as possible.","Harris H. Simmons","Well, yes. It's Harris Simmons talking. I'd tell you that probably most of the growth has come in multifamily. We are starting to step down the rate at which we are expanding that piece of the portfolio. And I think we're thinking that we're probably getting to the point that we're reasonably full-up with respect to what we're going to do in that space. We've -- I'd say couple of things about it. One is we've been really attentive to location. And so we've seen probably more growth, for example, in some of the coastal communities in California, for example, than some other markets where we see just unrelenting demand for this kind of product. And the other thing I'd say is we've seen structurally much better equity coming into these kinds of deals over the last year and a half than we'd seen in prior parts of this cycle or prior cycles. I mean we're seeing typically 40% plus equity come in -- of the costs coming in to these projects. So we're pretty comfortable with the quality of what we've been doing, but we're also getting to a point where we're probably starting to kind of ramp it down.","James R. Abbott","Well, and as we noted in our prepared remarks, a number of -- new commitment volume in the first quarter was lower than it has been for the prior several quarters.","Gaston  F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great, understood. And then just a very quick follow-up on something else. I realized this is not the biggest part of your noninterest income but -- and I apologize if you mentioned it earlier and I missed it, but just curious what your outlook for your trust and wealth management and capital markets lines are going forward, if you see a kind of steadiness there or any improvement?","Harris H. Simmons","Trust and wealth management should continue to grow incrementally. Not -- no step function due to an acquisition or anything like that. Capital markets, again, probably slow in modest incremental growth for Zions' direct platform, which we used ourselves for issuing our own preferred stock and debt and other things, and we'll continue to do. So -- but again, no transformational kind of change in those lines.","Operator","The next question comes from Brad Milsaps from Sandler O'Neill.","Brad J. Milsaps - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a follow-up question on the other expense line item. I think, if you look in the release, there was about $9.7 million of increased amortization on the FDIC asset compared to the fourth quarter. Just curious if there's anything else in that other line item. And then just want to confirm your guidance. I think you said that could drop to sort of a low $60 million kind of run rate maybe a year from now?","Doyle L. Arnold","James, you want to amplify that?","James R. Abbott","Yes, we had some -- Brad, we had some prepayments in the California acquisitions from the FDIC, and those prepayments caused an increase in the revenue side of the equation but also on the expense side of the equation. So the expenses do fall into other noninterest expense line item. It's hard to really forecast how that will behave. It's -- it really is prepayment-dependent, and we're getting to the bottom of the pool, but collateral values are improving quite significantly, as you know. And so that's I think one of the major drivers behind it is people are finally getting back to neutral or above water on their mortgages and are able to prepay them and get financed at a lower rate. We do have another year or so of indemnification asset expense to go. And at that point, it will dry up.","Harris H. Simmons","Well, it won't dry up totally. There's a little tail that extends for another 5 years. But most of it, yes.","James R. Abbott","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you quantify the impacts of prepays? Because I'm just trying to go through all the pieces in the NII, and if I did hear you right, you said it's going to be stable again in second quarter versus first quarter. Can you just make sure we get all the numbers, sort of the pluses and minuses for that?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, Ken, I think that the amount of prepayment income or the amount that would be attributable to accelerated prepays would be $5 million or $6 million on the revenue side. So if you look at the numbers month by month, that -- we did return back sort of a more normalized level in the month of March. January and February were very elevated in terms of revenue, and therefore, indemnification asset expense. So I think that, that's your amount and I think it can come back down. But again, it's very, very hard to predict whether that will happen again in the second quarter or the third.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood, okay. So the $5 million, let's assume it goes away, then you get the positive numbers, then $422 million is a run rate for second quarter. And then going out, you get the positive benefit from the seasonality. So really full year annualized in '13 is probably -- I mean, is it right to assume sort of a $422 million plus a little bit annualized?","Doyle L. Arnold","Assuming no balance sheet growth? That's probably appropriate.","James R. Abbott","The strongest argument for never doing an assisted acquisition again is accounting for it. And the second strongest argument is explaining the accounting part. I think it just makes -- it's ridiculous.","Doyle L. Arnold","Nevertheless, it makes a lot of money.","James R. Abbott","[indiscernible] a lot of money. So the strongest argument...","Doyle L. Arnold","So get over it.","James R. Abbott","Yes.","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, let's not forget that we accrued -- we bought these things at a discount that created $150 million or $120 million of capital common equity without issuing any shares, and it's performed better than -- than we modeled in getting to that number. But it's devilishly confusing, I agree.","Operator","The next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you help quantify the annual environmental costs that are in your expense base that are credit-related as of this quarter? How that number went down? I know the OREO costs were down. But in total, what is annual amount that's in the expense base as of this quarter, and can you remind us where that could go to on a normalized basis?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, we break out, I don't know, what is it, about 4 or 5 different lines that are credit-related? The OREO I think, speaks for itself. Credit-related expense, the unfunded lending commitment provision and the FDIC premiums, all of those are still elevated from what I would consider to be a run rate. The FDIC premiums, I haven't -- I can't quantify what -- exactly what they could come down to, but there's at least a few million dollars a quarter there. There's some in legal and professional expenses. Again, I'm not quite sure how much but a number that could have 2 commas in it. The unfunded lending commitment provision normally should be it's -- kind of 2 things that could drive that. Loan growth, new commitment growth and then changes in the quality of existing commitments, if there's a downgrade on the line, the unfunded draws also require reserves. But that's -- that number strikes me -- I mean, there could be some negative provisions from quarter-to-quarter as we continue to see the improvement in credit quality. But normally, that should -- in a growth period, that number ought to be slightly positive each quarter. Not negative. And, let's see, not sure about the other 2. OREO, once we work through all of this, ought to -- in a prolonged benign period, ought to be just close to 0. And other credit-related expense, I'm not sure how -- do you have any comment on how elevated that might be, James?","James R. Abbott","Yes, the other?","Doyle L. Arnold","Yes, the credit -- just the line credit-related, $3.5 million.","James R. Abbott","Well, the credit-related is, we mentioned before that we think that -- its lowest point per quarter was about $2 million a quarter. But we've kind of characterized that as unusual because loan prices were going up 20 -- commercial prices were going up 20%. So in a normal environment, maybe $5 million or so.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then on the commercial real estate front, can you just talk about when do you think we can see sustainable turn in commercial real estate balances? We saw the owner-occupied piece pull back this quarter, but we did see land pick up as you had been guiding to. I guess just give us your overall thoughts given you have so much of a concentration is still in real estate related lending. When can we see a nice sustainable pickup there in those balances?","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, I would say -- gosh, it's hard to say. We've seen, as we said earlier, pretty good strength in terms of production, but we've seen a lot of prepayment. And I tend to believe that you'll see it start to -- seeing rates move a little higher, we'll start to [indiscernible] some of the prepayment activity. And in the meantime, you've had increased activity from insurance companies, a healthier CMBS market, etc. So it's a little hard to say. We're spinning the wheels pretty fast to stay nearly in place, but it's a little higher rate environment, I think would actually be helpful that way. On the construction side, you're not going to see much in way of land development. I mean, we just don't have a lot of appetite for that at all. And other kinds of construction, as mentioned, multifamily, that's probably smalling down. We'll see some growth in outstandings. We'll see as the commitments are drawn down that are out there. But I wouldn't look for that piece of the portfolio to become nearly as significant as it was 5 years ago. So I rather expect that, over time, you'll see more emphasis generally on the commercial categories, some consumer. We'd hope to stabilize commercial real estate, see it maybe grow a little bit, but it's not going to see the kind of growth that we've maybe seen in past cycles or as activity picks up in the economy.","Operator","The next question comes from Todd Hagerman from Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Doyle, just wondering, in terms of your capital plan and some of the comments you made on the preferred -- special preferred, if you could just help me unwind, if you will, with the capital plan specifically on the Series C and the commentary in the release about there could be possibly some matched issuances? In other words, I'm just trying to get a sense, as we talked about the Series G or you referenced that, I'm just trying to get a sense just kind of longer term over the next 12 months, kind of the potential timing and how I think about the -- kind of the net savings, if you will, between the matched issuances and the redemptions, if there's a way to think about that, if you will.","Doyle L. Arnold","The -- well, the basic facts are that we're not going to reduce our perpetual preferred outstanding. And the Series C becomes callable, in all or in part, in September. We'd have to give the notice in mid-August. But we're -- but because the total amount is not going to come down, we have -- that means we have to the do one of 2 things: either issue an advance and have, for whatever we decide to call or -- and\/or issue an offer to exchange Series C into an outstanding issue. But either way, you're going to see some increase in the total amount of preferred outstanding, I mean you already have because we issued Series G. There will be more, and then we -- you know what current -- kind of current rates are. But order of magnitude, we ought to be able to save at least 3% after-tax and perhaps a bit more than that on the -- hopefully, I think a lot more than that, on the Series C. So you're going to -- you ought to model kind of over a 12-month period -- well, one other fact, the -- it's callable in whole or in part September 15 and every quarter thereafter. So I would say over your 12-month horizon, you should sort of plan for all of the seed of -- disappear and be replaced by a like amount of cheaper stuff would be the best planning assumption.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. And is any part of that, as in the fall, in the capital plan, does a piece of that have to be approved by the Fed or just -- how is that working with the CCAR process and the plan that was submitted? Is there anything I should think about just in terms of incremental approvals that are necessary for that, for the Series C?","Doyle L. Arnold","By law, I can't talk about my interactions with supervisors. And once upon a time, I got lulled into a degree of candor for which I got my wrists slapped later, not by the Fed but by another agency. So I'm just going to beg off on your question. That question, totally, Todd, just stay tuned. I think things will become clearer over the coming weeks or month or 2.","Operator","Next question comes from John Moran from Macquarie Capital.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","So just one kind of maybe one on salaries on the OpEx line. I think, Doyle, you said a couple of million of that is seasonally high. I think last year, it ran about $5 million high. Is that still a good number to think about there?","James R. Abbott","Well, not immediately, but yes.","Doyle L. Arnold","Well, yes it's -- the incremental -- the uptick in FICA payments and whatnot compared to the fourth quarter was about $5 million. That doesn't all go away in the second quarter. It kind of tapers off over the year. But a meaningful amount of it goes away each quarter. As people hit their limit, FICA limits.","John V. Moran - Macquarie Research","Okay, got you. And then maybe just a follow-up to the capital discussion here. Are there pieces of capital outside of the TRUPs that we know are going away? But are there pieces of the capital stack that could be called not on a dollar-for-dollar basis?","Doyle L. Arnold","No. Not at the present time. That would include both Tier 1 and Tier 2.","Operator","The final question comes from Dave Rochester from Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Back on the loan pricing, you've given us some good color on this already, but I was just wondering if you could remind us where your all-in loan production rate is now, given the pressure that you were talking about this quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense for how that compares to where the book yield is today?","Doyle L. Arnold","It is -- James is flipping through pages. It is...","James R. Abbott","Let me grab it real quick for you, Dave.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Are you still at a 4-handle or did you guys dip below that?","James R. Abbott","It was -- and again, it's got mix shift issues. So these are -- but just based on the mix that we produced in the first quarter, not including any fees which are normally amortized or are amortized into your average balance sheet yield, of course. But just the coupon was about 3.9%. And...","David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got you. When you're talking about mix, are you talking about large versus small credits or just by product?","James R. Abbott","Large and small, and also by product.","David Rochester - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Are you doing more large credits now -- or this quarter versus prior quarter or...?","James R. Abbott","No, fewer large credits. Syndicated credits declined compared to the prior quarter, and it's just not as attractive of a yield.","Harris H. Simmons","I think we have to wrap it up, James.","James R. Abbott","Yes, thank you for your participation today. Thank you, Jamie, for your hosting the call. And we appreciate everyone's time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]","I would now like to hand the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott.","James Abbott","Thank you and good evening. We welcome you to this conference call to discuss our 2019 fourth quarter and full year earnings. For our agenda today, Harris Simmons, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a brief overview of key strategic and financial performance figures; after which, Paul Burdiss, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide additional detail on Zions' financial condition, wrapping up with our financial outlook. Additional executives with us in the room today include Scott McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Morris, Chief Credit Officer.","Referencing Slide 2, I would like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, although actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in the press release or the slide deck dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. A copy of the full earnings release as well as a supplemental slide deck, are available at zionsbancorporation.com. We will be referring to the slides during this call.","The earnings release, the related slide presentation in this earnings call contain several references to non-GAAP measures, including pre-provision net revenue and the efficiency ratio, which are common industry terms used by investors and financial services analysts. The use of such non-GAAP measures are believed by management to be of substantial interest to the consumers of these financial disclosures and are used prominently throughout the disclosures. A full reconciliation of the difference between these measures and GAAP financials is provided within the published documents, and participants are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation.","We intend to limit the length of this call to one hour. During the question-and-answer session of the call, we ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one related follow-up question to enable other participants to ask questions.","I'll now turn the time over to Harris.","Harris Simmons","Thanks very much, James. And we welcome all of you to our call today to discuss our 2019 fourth quarter and full year results. Slide 3 is a summary of several key highlights, which I'll cover in the next few slides. So I'm going to move right to Slide 4.","Slide 4 shows a time series of the bottom line earnings per share results. We reported earnings per share of $0.97. As noted on the slide in the fourth quarter of 2019, there were three items that adversely affected the earnings per share figure by a net $0.17. Also shown is the adjusted pre-provision net revenue, which is noted already excludes the impact of $37 million of non-interest expense related to severance and restructuring charges. However, the PPNR number also includes the positive impact of the derivative valuation gain on client-related interest rate swaps, and the $10 million adverse impacts associated with the resolution of the self-identified operational issue.","Moving to Slide 5, the efficiency ratio is of course a function of both revenue and expense, with a relatively quick change in the trajectory of interest rates in mid 2019 and the expectation is such a change would create a revenue headwind. We took action to adapt quickly on the expense front in order to actively manage our profitability. We announced three months ago in conjunction with our third quarter earnings release a plan to cut about 5% of our staff positions and a number of other positions that were not yet filled.","We also said that the resulting reduction in salaries and benefits would be roughly proportional to the number of positions eliminated and that these reductions should be reflected in our financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2020. We'll continue to work to reduce the variety of costs and execute on plans we've announced to realign certain branches during 2020. In short, we've tried hard to respond to a rapidly changing business environment, really an interest rate environment. And I believe these efforts should help to offset some of the interest rate related revenue challenges we expect in 2020.","Turning to Slide 6. One of Zion's strengths is its sizable portfolio of non-interest bearing deposits, which account for more than 40% of total deposits. During the fourth quarter, average non-interest bearing deposits increased an annualized 7.5%. Average total deposits increased an annualized 10.5%. The cost of deposits declined 6 basis points, which equals to 12% linked quarter improvement relative to our third quarter total cost of deposits.","Going now to Slide 7. Credit costs remain low. Consistent with my comments last quarter, credit losses have been somewhat episodic within our loan portfolio attributable to problems specific to a small handful of borrower's unique circumstances. Net charge offs for the full year were a modest 8 basis points, generally consistent with our expectations for the year.","Non-accrual loans and loans and 90 days past due continue to show improvement. Our non-performing assets plus loans 90 days past due, expressed as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned at 51 basis points, was 4 basis points lower than the year ago period. Our improved risk management and credit performance have been key factors in improvement in our debt ratings in the recent months.","Due largely to the strong credit quality of the loan portfolio, resulting in part from a shift in recent years in the portfolio's composition to what we believe is a less risky credit profile and due to a reduced risk profile generally, we have been able to reduce our capital ratio as to level closer to that of our peers. We're pleased to have repurchased more than 3% of our outstanding shares in the fourth quarter and more than 12% of our shares during 2019. In addition to a substantial buyback program during the past few quarters, we've also been delivering an annualized common dividend yield of nearly 3%. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio remained strong at 10.2%.","Next let me step back from the financial data and update you on just one of the variety of strategic initiatives we have underway, and that's the digital delivery. Shown on Slide 8. We're enhancing digital experiences for our customers with a goal of being quite competitive with best providers financial services products, banks and non-banks alike. While remain focused on continuous improvement in streamlining our processes, thereby, keeping non-interest expense under control. We continue to make solid progress, notably in small business and consumer digital account opening in small business and mortgage digital loan application processes.","Additionally, we're on track to significantly enhance our online consumer and small business mobile platforms later this year. Our core replacements initiative remains on track. And I've noticed that at least a couple of other of our peers have recently announced that they would be embarking on some form of core systems replacement projects. We'll spend a significant amount of time on our core systems' replacement and our other technology initiatives at our Investor Day in just two weeks.","With that overview, I'm going to turn the time over to Paul Burdiss to review our financials in additional detail. Paul?","Paul Burdiss","Thank you, Harris, and good evening everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll begin on Slide 9, which highlights two measures of balance sheet profitability, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity. As noted, the fourth quarter results were adversely impacted by the severance and restructuring charges and the resolution of our operational issue, and positively impacted by a derivative valuation gain on customer related interest rate swaps. Combined, these factors adversely impacted return on average assets by about 20 basis points and return on average tangible common equity by about 200 basis points. We remain focused on continuing to improve balance sheet profitability.","On Slide 10 looking at the chart on the left. Zions' net interest income declined slightly compared to the prior year period. While average earning assets increased by 3% during that timeframe, the yield on earning assets decreased by 17 basis points and the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased by 2 basis points, leading to a decline in the rate spread of 19 basis points and a decline in the net interest margin of 21 basis points. Net interest income was down 3% over this period as the decline in net interest margin was somewhat offset by balance sheet growth.","Turning to a linked quarter view. The net interest margin compressed 2 basis points relative to the third quarter, as the lower interest rate environment continued to impact loan and securities yields and also led to lower borrowing costs. The waterfall chart on the right depicts the elements that resulted in the linked quarter change in net interest margin. Within the loan yields bar, about half was portfolio churn, sometimes referred to as the front book and back book, while the other half was due to the change in benchmark interest rates.","On the funding side, the net interest margin impact of the cost of funds decline was evenly mixed between the cost of deposits and the cost of wholesale funds. As Harris noted, highlights in the quarter included the growth of deposits and the decline in the cost of average deposits. While our cost of funds increased 3 basis points over the year ago period, it decreased a solid 14 basis points from the third quarter of 2019 to 57 basis points from 71 basis points, or about a 20% improvement in cost. This was primarily due to lower rates paid on all interest bearing liabilities in addition to a favorable mix shift, as solid deposit growth made it possible to reduce wholesale borrowings. We expect that the net interest margin will compress further during the next couple of quarters, reflecting the forward curve and our best estimates of loan yields, deposit costs, balance sheet churn and other factors.","Slide 11 highlights a key component of net interest income, loan and deposit growth and breaks them down by both rate and volume. Average loans grew 5% over the year ago period. Average loans in the fourth quarter were essentially flat to the prior quarter. As we have noted previously, it is not unusual to observe a quarterly ebb and flow to balance sheet growth due to several factors, including customer demand, the balance of loan growth and payoffs and seasonality.","Over the prior year period, the yield on loans decreased 23 basis points and relative to the prior quarter, the yield on loans decreased 19 basis points. As I noted in the discussion of the previous slide, about half of the linked quarter compression in loan yields was due to movement in benchmark interest rates and the other half can be attributed to the churn of the portfolio, where new yields are 15 to 20 basis points less than maturing loan yields.","Shifting to funding. Average total deposits increased 5 percentage points over the prior year period and a solid 10 percentage points annualized growth rate when compared to prior quarter. As I noted the last quarter, maintaining this rate of growth in deposits will be difficult, especially with seasonal factors typically seen in the first few months of the year. Nevertheless, we expect moderate deposit growth to accompany our loan growth for 2020.","Slide 12 is a new slide and shows the changes in our investment portfolio size and yield, and changes in our borrowed funds position size and yields. As I have mentioned on previous calls, we reevaluated the on balance sheet liquidity a few quarters ago and in conjunction with that analysis, selected to bring down the size of the securities portfolio. Simultaneously, we were able to achieve solid growth in deposits. The combination of these two trends allowed us to pay down wholesale borrowings by about $2 billion in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, almost all of the wholesale borrowings are variable rate. These changes in the lower interest rate environment has allowed the cost of borrowed funds decrease 20 basis points relative to the prior quarter, and 44 basis points from the year ago period.","Turning to loan growth. Slide 13 depicts year-over-year period-end loan growth by portfolio type with the size of the circles representing the relative size of the portfolio. Municipal loan growth has been a highlight for a couple of years now. The marginal credit quality there is very good with the average new deal being about $4 million and the probability of default being relatively low. Loan growth across the enterprise also reflects our credit risk appetite and active management of portfolio concentration limits.","On Slide 14, customer related fees were up 2% from the year ago period. In certain categories, our long tenured and deep client relationships enable stable core fee income. This includes commercial account fees, card fees and retail and business banking fees. We have clear growth opportunities in certain other segments, and have been working to improve the revenue from these areas. Notably, we are seeing strength in capital markets product sales, which were up 19% from the prior year, as well as wealth management and trust fees, which are up 14% from the prior year period.","As shown on Slide 15, non-interest expense increased 12% to $472 million from $420 million in the year ago quarter, adversely impacted by the previously mentioned $37 million in severance and restructuring costs and $10 million for the resolution of an operational issue. Excluding the impact of these items, the non-interest expense reflects the ongoing efforts to reduce expenses, streamline operations and improve overall efficiency with notable reductions in advertising, credit related expense and professional and legal services over the prior year period. During the fourth quarter, we ran a full parallel allowance for credit loss process, one for the incurred loss accounting standard and the other for the new current expected credit loss or CECL accounting standard.","Slide 16 reports the results of that parallel run. We have highlighted the various changes that may impact the allowance for each of the major loan portfolios with a total estimated impact on the allowance for credit losses at the bottom of the table. Our day one impact on the allowance for credit losses was 5% reduction associated with the adoption of the new CECL accounting standard.","I might add a word of caution here. We've noted many times in the past that we expect our allowance to become more volatile under the new CECL process, as it is now subject to economic forecasts that may move materially from quarter-to-quarter. Therefore, our day one impact and the allowance for credit losses, which will be set at March 31, 2020, may be materially different.","Now I'll turn to the outlook Slide on Page 17. This is our financial outlook for the next 12 months relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. Our loan growth outlook remains unchanged at moderately increasing. Our outlook for net interest income remains slightly decreasing, incorporating our outlook of the current shape of the yield curve and our continued expectation that balance sheet growth will be more than offset by the continued trend in the portfolio.","We will continue to actively manage our deposit pricing in the lower rate environment, and this may present some upside opportunity to this outlook. Regarding customer related fees, we expect slightly increasing customer related fees a year from now when compared to the fourth quarter. Building on our prior comments related to noninterest expense, we expect the overall level of adjusted noninterest expense in 2020 to be consistent with or slightly below adjusted non-interest expense for 2019.","As a reminder, the position of elimination announced in October of 2019 will begin to impact the run rate of noninterest expense in the first quarter of 2020. Also, as we have previously disclosed, we are in the process of resolving or defined benefit pension plan, which is expected to result in a onetime charge likely towards the middle of 2020. Our outlook for adjusted noninterest expense excludes this charge.","Finally, regarding capital management. Our CET 1 ratio has declined to 10.2% from 11.7% a year ago. Our current level of capital is more than sufficient to support the risk on our balance sheet implied by our internal stress testing. Our CET 1 ratio remains above the median of our peers. We continue to believe that remaining stronger than the peer median is important.","Maintaining a risk profile, which we believe compares favourably to peers while also maintaining relatively strong positions in capital and liquidity is prudent. Therefore, we expect the capital return to shareholders in 2020 will be significantly less than it was in 2019, assuming no material change in the macroeconomic environment. Said differently, we expect our capital ratio to remain relatively stable throughout 2020 when compared to the levels reported this quarter.","This concludes our prepared remarks. Andrew, would you open the line for questions? Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","I guess, just to start off. I saw net charge offs jump up a little bit to $22 million. Obviously, I did not see a related increase in your provision expense. Can you just provide a little more detail on what drove the higher charge offs in the quarter?","Michael Morris","Sure, Ken. This is Michael Morris. We had one modest charge off in Q4 that drove the overall charge offs for the year. Beyond that, we saw stabilization and stronger probability of default metrics around the rest of the portfolio along with better improvement. So it was not material enough to drive increased unit sale.","Harris Simmons","And I would say, it was not related to any other segment of the portfolio. I would characterize it -- Michael, correct me, if I'm wrong. But I would characterize it as sort of a one-off charge off.","Ken Zerbe","Was there any industry or particular industry that was in?","Paul Burdiss","It's a recreation industry. And it was a $10.8 million charge off that's going to came out of blue -- we threw in the towel and locked on this large investment and we and some others took it in.","Michael Morris","As Paul noted, there's nothing systemic. It's not like we have a portfolio of these kind of loans et cetera, et cetera.","Ken Zerbe","And I'll refrain from asking if it was less federally legal recreation type...","Paul Burdiss","It was very legal.","Ken Zerbe","And just my follow-up question. On expenses, obviously, you took severance and restructuring charges, totally get it. It seems your guidance is still sort of unchanged or sort of already consensus, and myself are already building in sort of that modest reduction in '20 versus '19. Is that just only the fact that you adjust to your guys back in 3Q such that -- because I guess I'm just been trying to figure out like how meaningful that is going to be in first quarter when you start to see the benefit from those restructuring actions?","Harris Simmons","Yes, the outlook is unchanged. Because as you said, we had sort of full information by the time we reported third quarter earnings towards the end of October. And so that will be -- the expense reductions that we have undertaken were baked into that outlook that we provided in the third quarter. And as it relates to run rate, we are saying kind of flat to slightly decreasing relative to full year adjusted 2019. And we're saying that, because while these reductions are allowing us to continue to make the investments that we think are important to run the business, including continuing to invest in our people.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","On the NIM, I know you gave the comment that you expect some incremental compression here over the next couple of quarters. Can you just help maybe size that up? Is it similar to the magnitude of the compression that you saw in the fourth quarter of about couple bps? Is that the pace that we're looking for? And what's the likely driver going to be? Is it ongoing modest pressure on the loan book? Is that where the pressure is coming from?","Paul Burdiss","John, as you know, we don't provide specifically guidance on the net interest margin. We do, however, provide an outlook on loan growth and net interest income, which you see on our outlook slide. So I don't want to go further than that. I will say that the ongoing net interest margin pressure would really be related to the loan portfolio churn that I described in my prepared remarks. And also as I said the opportunity I think is re-pricing deposits. And so to the extent we are successful there, obviously -- and are able to replace our deposits lower, that'll have a positive impact.","John Pancari","And then on the loan growth front, I just want to get a little bit more color around what areas of the loan portfolio do you expect to drive the bulk of the growth as you look into 2020? And more specifically regarding the municipal loan book, I know you've seen some really good growth there. What's your appetite for incremental growth here? Do you have a target size that you're willing to let that book reach? Thanks.","Scott McLean","John, its Scott McLean. And our growth should continue to look like the year-to-date panel that you see on Slide 22. Basically 50% to 60% coming from C&I, that's where municipal sits. And we don't feel like we're reaching any limits in terms of our municipal growth. It's been growing rapidly largely because it was coming off of very small base. But the underwriting procedures we're using and practices are highly consistent with what we've done for many, many years there we just have leaned into the area, covering more geography more densely than we have historically.","So we see continued growth in municipal. But the growth in 2020, it should look like 19 by 50% 60% C&I. We'll see some modest growth in CRE, but it would probably be low-single digits. And then consumer, I think we'll continue to see will represent 20% of our growth plus or minus. Largely -- it's largely driven by our 1-4 family and home equity businesses. I would just note on the fourth quarter being soft. The four quarters ending in the third quarter of '19 were all very strong. But if you look back prior to then, we had two to three soft quarters in a row. And so we're not especially alarmed by having a soft fourth quarter here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust.","Jennifer Demba","Two questions. First, can you just talk about the operational issue you outlined in the nonrecurring items? And secondly, other than technology investments and your progress there and strategy there, could you talk about maybe the other topics you're going to focus on, on February 6th at the Investor Day?","Scott McLean","The operational issue, I would just describe it as, as we have wanted it was self identified. Secondly, as we continue to adopt common practices, we just saw some disparity in a certain pricing practice that we have, that we thought we really just needed to double back and create consistency over a period of time, that's all it was. The dollar amounts larger than we would have liked, but we felt like it was the right thing to do. So, no real story there other than just creating consistency in our practices across the Company relative to how we price items to our customers. And for the Investor Day, Paul, you want to take\u2026","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I can -- at a high level. Yes, we are going to talk about technology, as you would expect. But I think the idea of this year is that we're going to talk about technology in the context of our business and really demonstrate kind of how we're going to market and where we're focusing our business, how technology is going to support that and then of course, provide an update on credit and financial outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","So I am thinking about the outlook slide. Is positive operating leverage still possible in full year 2020? I caught in the remarks potential upside mentioned from you know potentially pulling more on the expense lever and potentially also pulling more on the deposit cost lever?","Paul Burdiss","Erika, we have not commented specifically about positive operating leverage. As we have mentioned previously over the sort of the medium and long-term that's clearly our goal. I think next year will be tough. As we outlined in slide, while non-interest income will be up net interest income is expected to be slightly down. And so expenses, with expenses sort of flat to down in that brew of revenue as I said, I think positive operating leverage will be tough to achieve in 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","I have kind of a big picture type question. I am speaking where we are in the cycle, how you guys think about the balance between protecting the profitability ratios versus growing the balance sheet?","Scott McLean","I guess I'll just say that, I think it's a time where you, everybody -- you have to be just very careful. That said, we keep asking ourselves, where are we in the cycle because, I mean, this has been a very unusual cycle. It's been about as long and flat as the yield curve is, in some respects in terms of the -- it's been in a low growth for a very long period of time. And we're not seeing anything that suggests to us that anything's about to turn suddenly. We're not seeing anything systematically in our credit metrics, our portfolio that gives us any real pause. But you just know that some point we're going to see a cycle.","And so trying to -- we'll try to be careful. We certainly establish goals and targets and certainly in terms of what we'd like to see in the way of loan growth. At least starting with me, I'm pretty careful about making we had sort of a main thing around here as to hit loan growth targets. I think that's just a -- that creates a culture that's not very healthy enough in the financial institution.","Deposits is kind of different animal, I mean, you can push people when they get deposits. But loans, the nature of that game is you have to be selective. And so, while we hope to see the kind of loan growth we've outlined here expect to see it, we're going to be careful along the way. I think we have done in the last couple of years.","Paul Burdiss","I would just add to that, if you look at the loan categories that are possibly most toxic going into a decline, construction lending, as an example. Our construction loan growth has been really flat, really dating back to 2014 and before we're up may be $300 million in terms of total outstandings in construction loans from 12\/14 to 12\/19. We're not a big card or auto lender, and those are two places where you see a lot of challenges going into a downturn. In our leverage portfolio, as we've talked about before, compared to our peers is we are underexposed their relative to our peers. Although, you have to always watch that portfolio carefully. So those three product categories that you would want to be really concerned about if you saw a lot of rapid growth and we haven't experienced that.","Scott McLean","I'd just add to that, in energy, we've significantly reduced our total exposure to the services sector over the last three or four years. And so, the portfolio has in terms of its self composition has that up to 100%, but that something has become more conservative we think over time.","Peter Winter","And then just on the loans. Can you give us update on customer sentiment and how it compares to maybe last quarter if you're seeing an improvement?","Paul Burdiss","I think it's, I mean, around the markets we're in its still pretty good, and maybe even getting a little better from where it was a quarter ago. I mean, we still hear concerns about labor availability and there's sort of high-class problems, if you will, as opposed to the kinds of challenges that can really hurt businesses. I think that the economy feels pretty good throughout the west.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","I want to first ask you, so securities portfolio came down quite a bit in 2019 is a telegraph. So how do you think about this in 2020? Should we still expect a decline in the portfolio?","Paul Burdiss","I wouldn't expect. A lot of this kind of balance sheet repositioning, I'll call it, we really took care of it in 2019. So we are constantly looking at our kind of net liquidity position and constantly thinking about the size of the portfolio relative to size of the balance sheet, and it's really been driven by our liquidity stress testing. I don't foresee a big decline from here in the securities portfolio. But as I've said, we're in such a flat interest rate environment. We're very sensitive to the fact that the securities portfolio is not a moneymaker for us, and it's dilutive to the margin and frankly the income. And so we are managing that portfolio almost completely for liquidity at this point.","Steven Alexopoulos","And where are new yields for new securities?","Paul Burdiss","Last quarter, we -- our average was about 245 of the securities we put on.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then finally on expenses, as we look at the expense outlook. Does that include the anticipated benefit from eliminating the defined benefit pension plan?","Paul Burdiss","Our plan has been closed for years. And so what's happened is that it's not really for -- I've been here five years, and it's really not been -- had a significant impact on our noninterest expenses that I can think of in any given year over the last five years, because we had closed it kind of 10 years ago to new entrants and it was no longer, as I recall, accruing benefits. So this is really sort of an administratively -- this is a plan that was waning as it was. And so this is sort of an acceleration of the resolution of all the liabilities in the plan.","Scott McLean","And as we've noted previously, when we say that expenses will be -- this is stable to slightly decreasing, that would exclude the -- this kind of one-time expense that takes the work that's currently in [AOCI] and runs through the income statement, puts it back into equity.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Paul, if I could ask you another right side of the balance sheet question. You obviously saw a really nicely remixing into deposits and were able to lower your wholesale debt profile. First question is just how much more room do you have to remix on the right side of the balance sheet?","Paul Burdiss","Well, as we said, we reduced wholesale balance here $2 billion in the fourth quarter. So to the extent we can continue to grow deposits and those deposits are priced correctly, we can continue to change that mix. Although, my expectation is and as we said in the outlook, the balance sheet will continue to grow and the wholesale funding will be an important part of just kind of an ongoing mix. So in other words, I don't see a huge opportunity there unless we get an outsized kind of deposit growth.","Ken Usdin","Okay, and that's my second question then just related to the type of deposit growth you got and the pricing of it. Can you talk about relative to the 11 or so basis point decline you saw in interest bearing deposit costs? Or how do you see that going from here? Meaning how much more ability is there just through the pull through of lower rates versus continuing to work with customers on the downside of rates as you had on the way up? Thanks.","Paul Burdiss","Yes, I believe, we continue to have opportunity there. When you look at where deposits were a year ago versus where they are now and then you compare that to the absolute level of rates. My belief is, while we won't get deposit rates down as low as they were one or two years ago, I think we still have some room to really manage that exception pricing to continue to work that pricing down.","Ken Usdin","One quick follow-up. Just in the slide deck you mentioned the year-over-year impact of premium amortization from the SBA book. Can you talk about is that expected to continue? Or is there any outlook for changes in premium amortization in your forward outlook?","Paul Burdiss","Not a big change. On the SBA book specifically, that is just over 10% of our investment portfolio. It used to be larger that is an asset class that is declining overtime. The other artifact about that asset is that it's floating rate, and so its prime based. And so you've got the -- in that particular case when you've got kind of a floating rate asset that is experiencing prepayments in a falling rate environment, the yields on that book have been put pressure on the whole portfolio. So as I said that part of the book is a little over 10% of the investment portfolio. But when you look at the 4 basis point decline in the yield, over half of that was related to the SBA book. So that's all incorporated into our outlook and we're not expecting a big change in that trend.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley.","Steve Moss","I wanted to ask about the increase in commercial NPL this quarter. Just wondering if that was driven by energy? And what are your expectations for the energy book and loan balances here going forward?","Michael Morris","I'll take that, Steve. This is Michael. The increase mostly is related to commercial loans, some oil and gas but mostly other non-oil and gas commercial, the outlook is favorable. We don't see further NPL issues for 2020. They're hard to predict, as you know. But we have, also we have quite a few non-performing loans that are actually contractually performing. So we look at the net number as well and it's positive relative to the industry in our peer group.","Scott McLean","On energies, do you want to -- were you asking about energy specifically, or...","Steve Moss","Yes, please Scott.","Scott McLean","Our commitments and our standings are well below our December 14 levels, which is really when they peak. And as Harris noted a bit ago, our exposure to services is now less than 20% of outstandings, down from about 42%, 43% of outstandings back then. And we're always watching this portfolio very closely. I think what's getting a lot of headlines is the equity markets are basically closed to upstream companies, E&P companies and to the midstream, and so that just creates a lot of sort of tension in the narrative about energy. The public debt markets and the private equity markets are open for upstream and midstream companies.","So capital is certainly flowing. And our upstream and midstream portfolios are there knock on wood. They're performing pretty well right now. Natural gas is also a really highly visible topic. Right now, pricing of natural gas will continue to be soft. It will stay in probably the sub-2 region for a bit here during the next couple of months, three to four months potentially. But that portfolio for us where we have natural gas in our borrowing basis came through the fall redetermination in pretty good shape. And we could have some criticized loans that have heavier natural gas exposure, but we think it's very manageable. So we're...","Paul Burdiss","And I think the $13 million dollar increase in non-performing loans of C&I this quarter didn't include anything with any material amount in oil and gas.","Scott McLean","Yes, energy nonperformings were basically flat to last quarter.","Steve Moss","And then let me may take one more crack at expenses here. The quarter included that $10 million item. Just wondering, like, is there just going to be an acceleration of the investment expense coming on that perhaps doesn't make it a little bit more constructive on the level of expenses -- the level of decreasing expenses?","Paul Burdiss","I would say that those two items are unrelated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klock with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Brian Klock","I was just going to ask you about the capital stack. I know that you guys -- your guidance is for the overall level of CET 1 and be stable here, and you guys have returned a lot of capital over the last few years. So just looking at your capital ratios, I mean the CET 1 is still pretty strong and even your total capital ratio is very strong. And then I look at you still have the 100-basis point cushion between CET 1 and your Tier 1. So it doesn't look like you need to do anything to add to that capital stack. But it does seem like maybe that, the preferred stock, it seems like it's a little bit expensive relative to what some of your other peers have issued at. Is there anything you guys can do to make that more efficient, anything in that preferred stock part of the stack that maybe you could refinance out for something cheaper?","Harris Simmons","We have been, Brian, you know, I think you've followed this for a while. We have been very active in kind of proactively managing particularly that preferred part of our capital stack, because we recognize it as being relatively expensive. But at this point, it would be hard for us to go out and kind of pick anything out of the open market. We really need to wait for the contractual provisions of the preferred before we can manage that any more closely.","Brian Klock","Got it, appreciate it. Thanks for your time guys. Let's see you in a couple of weeks.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm so no further questions at this time. So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Director of Investor Relations, James Abbott, for closing remarks.","James Abbott","Thank you, Andrew. And thank you for joining everyone. Our next public appearance will be on February 6th for our Investor Day, as Brian Klock just alluded to. That's scheduled to begin at 10:30 am Eastern time. If you would like to attend, please contact me either by phone or by email. And we look forward to seeing you at that point in time. Thank you again for your attendance today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."]}}
