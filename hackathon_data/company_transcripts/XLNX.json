My name is Jay, and I will be your conference operator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Q1 Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon A. Olson","Thank you, Rick. In the June quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 9% sequentially and better than forecasted. Most of the sales upside was related to better-than-expected growth in wired communication, with aerospace and defense sales also stronger than expected.","Sales from all geographies were up sequentially. Gross margin was higher than guided and a record 69% for the quarter. Roughly half of the gross margin upside is related to the result of margin expansion programs, which are yielding benefits faster than previously anticipated. The other half of the upside is product mix related.","Operating expenses of 261 -- excuse me, $206 million includes amortization were in line with guidance. We were able to offset higher variable sales and profit-related expense with overall spending reduction.","Operating margin was 33%, the highest since Q2 of fiscal year '11. New product sales drove most of the incremental sales growth during the quarter, increasing 24% sequentially. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $50 million, again, surpassing our forecast. Sales from this family were driven by all 5 family members, with Kintex family remaining the largest contributor.","Our 40-, 45-nanometer node also posted double-digit sales increase, with strong growth from both Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. Mainstream products decreased during the quarter, and base products increased as a result of strength in specific aerospace and defense programs, as well as accelerated sales associated with the previously discussed foundry line closure.","Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communication and data center increased 8% sequentially, better than forecasted as a result of strong wired communication sales. Wireless sales were flat sequentially, slightly stronger than we had anticipated due to a pickup in North America-based LTE activity.","Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased 10% sequentially, with strengths from all 3 subcategories. Defense sales were stronger than anticipated due to shipments associated with a specific government program. Broadcast, consumer and automotive was up 4% sequentially. Finally, the other category, which represents only 3% of our total sales, benefited from strong high-performance computing business during the quarter. Other income and expense was a net expense of $10 million, slightly higher than forecasted.","Net income for the quarter was $157 million or $0.56 per share -- per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $144 million before $11 million in CapEx. We paid $66 million in cash dividends during the quarter.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 280 million, 3 million higher than guided, primarily due to the impact of the higher stock price. There was an 11.1 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note due to the higher stock price. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $110 million to approximately $3.5 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $2.2 billion. Days sales outstanding increased 3 days in the June quarter to 42 days.","Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $14 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution together were 105 days, down from 110 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory dollars to be approximately flat in the September quarter.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal year '14. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting continued solid growth from new products, driven by 28-nanometer strength. Base and mainstream products are expected to be flat to slightly down sequentially.","From an end-market perspective, we expect communications to be approximately flat, with wired --- wireless increases offsetting wired decreases. While we have begun to see increased activity associated with the China Mobile and China Telecom LTE deployments, we continue to expect those LTE deployments to be a more material contributor to sales in the December quarter.","We expect industrial and aerospace and defense to be up, as growth from defense and tests are offset by decreases from ISM. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be approximately flat, with broadcast decreases offsetting increases from consumer and automotive.","As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to up 3% sequentially, with sales from North America and Asia Pacific increasing, sales from Japan flat and sales from Europe down. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 53%, consistent with our 4-year average.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. Though we are not revising our long-term growth margin target of 64% to 66% at this time, we believe gross margin will be approximately at the June levels for the next few quarters, as a result of product mix and continued focus on margin improvement across our product families.","Operating expenses in the September quarter is expected to be approximately $225 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We are revising our OpEx guidance for the fiscal year due to higher variable spending associated with higher-than-anticipated sales and profitability. The new fiscal year '14 operating guidance is approximately $495 million in R&D, approximately $385 million in SG&A and $10 million of amortization for a total of approximately $890 million for the year.","Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $9 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 284 million shares, and the tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 14%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. The 9% sequential growth in the June quarter was driven by increases in 6 of our secondary end markets. New product sales were exceptional during the quarter, increasing nearly 25% in the March quarter, 75% on a year-over-year basis. This growth was driven from both our 28-nanometer and our 40-, 45-nanometer product families, demonstrating widespread customer adoption in all application segments.","28-nanometer sales comfortably exceeded $50 million, higher -- significantly higher than our expectation. Sales were driven by growth from all 5 product families, led by our midrange Kintex-7 and all components of our high-performance Virtex-7 product families.","In the September quarter, we expect 28-nanometer to continue its accelerated growth, exceeding $60 million in sales. We remain confident that 28-nanometer sales will surpass our fiscal year goal for 2014 of $250 million, a goal we had established at our Analyst Day in March.","The accelerated sales ramp and tremendous customer adoption clearly demonstrate that we have established a proven technology leadership formula with our 28-nanometer portfolio. With Vivado, we've created the industry's first SoC-strength tool suite, which enables unmatched time to integration and implementation, and a very significant improvement in the positive results over previous development environments.","Second, leveraging our world-class partnerships with both TSMC and ARM have created the broadest portfolio of All-Programmable FPGAs, SoCs, and 3D ICs, offering an extra node of performance, lower power, superior connectivity and an absolute breakout in programmable systems integration.","Lastly, we're enabling smarter next-generation system and an even better alternatives to both ASICS and ASSPs, with a combination of SmartCORE IP, our C-based design tools and embedded software running on our industry-leading ARM-based solutions.","We recently announced the tape-out of the semiconductor industry's first 20-nanometer device and the PLD industry's first 20-nanometer All-Programmable device. We also implemented the industry's first ASIC-class programmable architecture called UltraScale. UltraScale devices enable next-generation smarter networking equipment, smarter vision systems, high-performance computing and intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance systems. These devices, when coupled with our Vivado design suite, will enable Xilinx to deliver another 1.5 to 2x system-level performance and integration value advantage, well ahead of any competition.","In the June quarter, we also extended what has been world-class partnership with TSMC by announcing that we're working on a program called FinFast to create the fastest time-to-market and highest performance FPGAs to be built on TSMC's 16-nanometer FinFET process. We expect to deliver test chips later this year with first product coming in 2014.","Having established proven leadership formula 28-nanometer and now expanding that formula with our next-generation architecture and product milestones, we are very well positioned to drive even more share gains against both ASICs, ASSPs and traditional PLD competition.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open us up for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Jon, my question, the first on gross margin. You said half is structural and half is product mix. So beyond the next few quarters that you have guided to should be -- what's the right way to think about it? 150 bp is variable, but the 150 from structural stays. And then I have a follow-up as well, please.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so we have -- we clearly have been focusing a lot on margin improvement programs across the company, as I said in my remarks, that starting -- some of them are coming a little earlier than we anticipated. And so what I was saying in the call about the gross margin forecast for the next few quarters, we do expect it to be in the neighborhood of 69% at the June quarter. And it is driven by a combination of continued structural improvements that I expect will continue to improve in -- as we go throughout the year, and then the impact from the product mix will be a little variable as you go quarter-to-quarter. But I would expect over this coming quarter, that impact starts to decline a little bit. And because you have one positive trend and one trend that's moderating a little bit, we think we can keep the margins in the neighborhood of 69%, flat for a while.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, okay, that's helpful, because -- so the key takeaway is that the half from structural is not done yet. You're still working on that part.","Jon A. Olson","Oh, absolutely, and I see additional benefits out in time for us there.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, good. And then a follow-up for you, Moshe. As we think through, and especially in the context of what Vivado is helping you do, as we think through the next node, 28 and beyond that, where does the mix for the business going to look like? Because right now, most of the time, we spend on the comp side, but is industrial and auto and all the other segments finally getting to a point that you see them becoming a bigger proportion for the -- and then what would the mix be in 28 and beyond?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So 28-nanometer is the broadest and the deepest node we've ever had, and it benefits all of our businesses. But they tend to benefit from it at a different pace. They all benefit from it, but the ones which clearly have a lead in our communications at this point. And of course, some ASIC prototyping, which was the very early product offering, and that continues now we're sort of seeing other markets like test and measurement start to pick up, and we expect wired communications to pick up too. You are right in that if you sort of look at it from 30,000 feet, [indiscernible], then communications is the biggest benefactor at this point from 28-nanometer, and the other markets will benefit over time. And the Zynq products offering, in particular, will have a very significant impact on industrial, scientific and medical. And then some of the others like military, aero just tend to take quite a bit longer, as does medical to translate into revenue. As you move forward, the product offering tends to have a higher end component to it where communications will benefit more from that than some of the other markets. So I would say that the 28-nanometer, you've yet to see the other markets emerge in force. It's just starting. It's less than 10% of our revenue at this point in time, and it's growing rapidly. 20 will lead with communications, and it will take a little longer for the other markets to manifest themselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Sanjay Chaurasia - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is Sanjay Chaurasia for Romit Shah. Moshe, one question I have for you, if you could provide any color on the wireline side of the business. It seems like it was the driver. Any color around if it was tied to any specific deployment and to service provider in enterprise [ph] or in technology, 10G versus 40G would be great.","Jon A. Olson","Sanjay, let me grab that one. So first, I would say that our wireline and data center business was very -- the increases were broadly distributed around customers. So if you look at the top 20 communications customers, of which there are quite a few wireline contributors in that more than the wireless, is pretty concentrated on a few names for us. But just the wireline, more than 75% of those -- of the customers that are in the top 20 showed an increase this quarter. So it wasn't just one technology or one application. We have made tremendous progress in 40-gig and 100-gig, since you brought those up, and particularly with our OTN-related IP is driving us to a tremendous number of design wins in that category. And some of those are starting to get into a preproduction kind of phase. But I have to say that if you look at the names of the tier 1s and even tier 2s, with communications customers in the wireline side, we saw quite a bit of growth, very broadly distributed.","Operator","The next question on the line comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Ryan Carver in for John. Just a question on the linearity in the quarter. The data points seem to imply that April was a pretty good quarter and May was a pretty good quarter, but maybe there was some falloff in June. Can you talk about -- a bit about your linearity in the quarter and just kind of, if you saw any of that or something different to that?","Jon A. Olson","Ryan, June was actually pretty -- the quarter was pretty linear from a historic perspective. And in fact, at times, we've seen June fall off towards the end as it goes into the summer from -- particularly from an industrial perspective and, in some respect, some of the communication equipment. And we didn't really see any kind of fallout whatsoever. So June for us was, I would say, a very, very solid quarter because -- I mean, we ended up being over the top of our guidance a few points, right? So it certainly showed strength throughout the month of June, maybe more than we had modeled as we walked into the beginning of the quarter.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just as my follow-up question, on the OpEx side, when you took up -- I mean, I think the guide for the September quarter was a bit above expectations. When you took up the full year numbers, it looks like around a lot of R&D. But even as a percentage of revenue, it looks like it came up a little bit. How should we think about sort of R&D, specifically, the percentage of revenue? And -- I mean, is this the new run rate that we should expect? Or is this sort of a peaker, a peaking time around 20-nanometer and should expect that to fall off? And I guess, how should we think about this sort of OpEx levels kind of trending over the next couple of quarters?","Jon A. Olson","For the near term, our OpEx will -- the second half of the year by quarter will look pretty similar to our forecast for the September quarter. So we're forecasting $225 million. It's going to be pretty flat, maybe up just a tad in the second half on a quarterly basis but relatively flat to that. And what's happening underlying that is we start to get incrementally more mass expense in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. And the first half of the year ends up with more variable impact from profitable variable kinds of things, bonuses, et cetera, because of the -- that's directly tied to our op margins from an employee bonus perspective. And so what's actually happening in the second half is the underlying I&D -- R&D, not the variable piece, but the contribution from developing and launching products goes up somewhat and the variable expenses moderate a little bit.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm hoping you can dig into the TD-LTE opportunity for us. It seems like we didn't see the strength from that this quarter as anticipated in the next quarter, also not a big impact but something bigger, you said, starting in December. Can you help us think about the potential upside there? And as we've seen the bid for one of the big carriers, investors have contemplated competitive moves by the others to drive a more robust growth opportunity in that end market. Can you comment as to whether you've seen any of that?","Jon A. Olson","Sure, let me -- we'll be happy to do that. The China TD-LTE business, we've been saying for some time that it was a second half of our fiscal year growth for us. So the December quarter and the March quarter for us was where the ramp would take place, so beginning in the September-October time frame. And at this point in time, we still have that same view that's been pretty consistent for us for the last 6 months, but that's been our view. Even though I know various other companies and other parts of Wall Street have tried to forecast acceleration, that will be pulled into the summer, et cetera, we've never really seen that. We've shipped in the March quarter and -- particularly and a little bit in the June quarter, we have shipped in with some prototype and early production for some of the early city trials that they're doing. And we certainly acknowledge the fact that the bids have now gone out at least for one of the suppliers, and so this process is moving along, I would say, pretty much as we had thought it would. And we're not -- I'm not trying to say we've got a great crystal ball and we know precisely what's going on, but it is relatively consistent with our view of the world. Now relative to the speed of the ramp, now we still believe there's the 200,000 base stations that are going to get deployed, and there's a lot of conversation around, are some of them upgradable from the old generation and the new generations? Those are very difficult things to know because it depends on which manufacturer, OEM, gets the business and which -- whether the provider decides to pursue some sort of a hybrid upgrade strategy. There's all these different articles written about how it could be done and whatever. At this point, it's not really clear how that's going to work out. We're very confident with our design win levels at all the manufacturers that we believe will be providing units. And again, we see the ramp beginning in the September, October timeframe for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Sameer Kalucha calling in for Chris Danely. One question on the share count. It has been creeping up, so I'm wondering how much is that from the convert? And how does it -- or how do we expect it to trend forward? Are there going to be any buybacks to bring it back to the earlier levels?","Jon A. Olson","Well, clearly, in the last several quarters, the impact has been a great deal from -- disproportionately from the convert versus other sources that have been driving it up. Now we do have some anti-dilutive protection in one of the 2 debt offerings that, from an accounting perspective, doesn't end up showing in the diluted shares. But that being said, it's really being driven more by the converts than anything else. And as the stock price goes up more, then more of it gets into the money in terms of the bigger way. We are still committed, as we've said consistently, to a share repurchase and a dividend program to return cash to shareholders. And we are still committed to buying back at least $150 million of stock for fiscal year, and I'll just leave it at that.","Operator","Next, we have Anil Doradla with William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A couple of questions. Moshe, how would you address the concerns from some quarters, saying that the industry can skip 20 nanometers and go from 28 to the 14, 16 FinFET? And the follow-up question was, was there any end-of-life for last-time buys? During the quarter, did you benefit from that?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. So no, if you look at the -- our current plans, we expect the next offering to be split over 2 nodes. It will be our UltraScale 20 and our UltraScale 16. And we are basically making sure that for the product offering, which benefits from the ultimate in terms of performance, then it's the 16 node, that, that will be a more expensive node and hence, the more cost-sensitive applications, are better serviced by 20-nanometer. And we're just splitting the family -- our next family across those 2. There'll be a very broad product offering at 20-nanometer and being first, and we believe actually having a larger lead now than we had at 28-nanometer node. We expect to have a very strong position at 20-nanometer. And we'll continue with our plans and committed to moving forward. And we, being in the lead, other companies have different strategies. But generally, I believe, for FPGAs, there's a huge benefit from -- going from 28 to 20, and that will be available -- as we tape out now, that will be available to our customers to start design, and they're already starting designs. And if they wait for nodes after that, that delays them by quite a significant period of time. So I think it's a very viable node for FPGAs. In other industries, in particular, ASSPs, I can see why for the very high performance, maybe graphics, they would want to skip straight to the 16-nanometer node. And that would make sense for them. For us, both nodes have their benefits, and we're splitting the business across them.","Jon A. Olson","I'll handle the second part of the question. So Anil, the situation we talked about some time ago is that one of our boundaries is end-of-life-ing [ph] a line. We were kind of the last man standing, and we've gotten to the point now where we cannot start any more wafers in that line. And so we've accumulated a significant amount of inventory for our customers, but this isn't what I would call our typical end-of-life for products. This is something that was accelerated by the fact the foundry was -- stopped producing products for us, so we've built a lot of inventory and are getting forecast and commitments from our customers, and we'll be delivering those products over an extended amount of time. So I'm talking about many, many quarters out in time. So you're not going to see, at least certainly anywhere in the near term, some giant pop and then a reversal of fortunes downstream. If you -- a good way to look at this is to look at our base product family. And if you look at the base products, which is where -- which is part of the base product family, is this particular set of products, and you'll see that the base products went up about $20 million quarter-on-quarter. Of that, about $10 million of that was related to an acceleration, if you will, over a normal run rate that certain customers decided to take part ahead of price increases. But the other $10 million was driven by strength in aerospace and defense business and the specific A&D program that continue to buy our legacy parts in order to ship into some of the larger programs that we've won historically, which will continue again for many years, because these are very large programs that the government is going to continue. So the real short of the answer -- to answer the question, there was some impact to that to both revenue and gross margin, but we don't expect this to be some sort of a leading, large pop that's here and then goes away in the following quarter.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Sumit Dhanda with ISI Group.","Ian Eigenbrod - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","This is Ian in for Sumit. Did you guys say how much Q2 was helped by the specific government programs?","Jon A. Olson","We did not say that. I did just comment on the answer to the previous question that there was about $10 million in our base product family that was incremental. I'd say, actually, compared to what we thought at the beginning of the quarter, about $10 million of business came in on a project that we weren't expecting. But there was actually another project that was in the neighborhood of the same size. So we continue to see improvement in our defense business, which I think maybe is a sign that the sequestration concerns and fears that may have been making the suppliers a little more reticent have loosened up a little bit. And we're forecasting defense to be up again in this September quarter as well. So we're seeing good contribution from the defense systems.","Operator","Next, we have the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I was hoping to follow up on your commentary on wireless CapEx. You mentioned your expectation for China, but I was hoping you could also provide some color on trends in North America and perhaps more broadly in other geographies as well?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, from an overall LTE perspective, we've been doing really well with the whole North America rollout, as well as South Korea and Japan. And it -- everybody's kind of wanted to say, \"Oh, where is the big increase coming out of North America?\" We've had, in our wireless business for quite a few quarters, very strong contribution for the rollout of Verizon and LTE -- excuse me, Verizon and AT&T. And then as Sprint starts to kick in, I think that will be some incremental. So we've got a really nice North America business that has a little bit of lumpiness, and we continue to see that strength go on for the next several quarters at least. So that's very good. We've seen, of late, some strength out of the South Korea area. And as I mentioned earlier, we're yet to see anything significant out of the China deployment. A couple of quarters ago, we did ship into some trials for Europe, but we've not seen any significant signs of any build from a European perspective at this point in time.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citigroup.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question for you on your visibility, looking at your market share potential in the China business, given the design wins that you've seen today and the progress you've made with Kintex, what's your confidence that in this next deployment, whatever the size, whatever the timing, that your share position will be better than the last time?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","The -- Glen, the question is related to China or generally speaking?","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes. I'm sorry, the China LTE buildout.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay, okay. So we're very confident that it's going to be a lot better than it was in the previous node. The Kintex product is the winning product in terms of its cost and performance and power and was designed specifically to address the wireless market. It actually is also beneficial for others, but it's definitely a clear winner there. And with regards to wireless, in particular, we're expecting a very high percentage of the wireless LTE business in China to use Kintex. If you compare it to the 40-nanometer, I would say, it's several times in terms of percentage of what we got. And I think we, at most, had 20%-ish before.","Jon A. Olson","It was -- in the early part of the 3G rollout in China, it was higher. And then it declined as designs moved to 40-nanometer. It started out in 65, and then they moved to 40 in China. And that's where we were disadvantaged with that product family. And the way that the LTE is going to roll out is that at the beginning, there will be some -- in certain supplier -- OEMs, there will be some 40-nanometer product, again, where we're disadvantaged. But they'll all be transitioning to 28-nanometer relatively rapidly over the initial few quarters, and we're very confident of our share position with the 28-nanometer win.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Jon, I just wanted to clarify one thing around the $10 million of base business that you talked about being incremental. Are you expecting any of that? Or is there any of that continuing into your fiscal Q2, that's implicit in your guidance or no?","Jon A. Olson","So what I would characterize being for the aerospace and defense business, that part of that increase in base of $20 million -- the $10 million of the $20 million was due to some specific aerospace and defense projects, and then we do expect a strong up defense business. And some of them will be in base, some of them will be in mainstream products. So we do expect a strong, healthy defense business. The $10 million that I was characterizing as -- was more along the broad-based foundry EOL. We do expect that to continue into the next quarter. But again, we're forecasting base to be overall kind of flat to down-ish. So we aren't expecting any sort of big pops from this particular EOL that will go on for quite a long time.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So revenue estimate's likely going up nicely this year. It seems most of the upside is 40- and 45-nanometer design wins. It seems 40 and 45 is up 20% this quarter, and it looks like, this year, you're still on track for $250 million in that 28. Is that sort of the right framework we should think of?","Jon A. Olson","Your latter statement is correct. But no, the growth that we've experienced overall is very strong 28-nanometer. We happen to have a slightly stronger contribution from 40, 45. But I don't -- I would expect, over the fiscal year, revenue growth horizon that 28 becomes the much more rapid growth vector for us.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, so north of $50 million this quarter and still on track for $250 million for the full year.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","We were explicit that we were well north of $50 million, and we set a target of $60 million. And we've beaten all of our targets to date. Our target for the year is $250 million, and we're very confident about beating that target.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Moshe, with the efforts at 16 and 20 nanometers at the same time, maybe you could articulate the benefits that the FinFETs give you? You said these are more for the expensive high-end parts, so is that -- is it sort of a logic shrink or lower power solutions, more integration?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Really, as you move from technology to technology, the benefits you get are typically lower power and higher performance, and achieving lower cost is more difficult and actually requires re-architecting your system and designing it from scratch to fully exploit the benefits of that. And some customers can do it, and some customers find that more difficult and it's a higher effort. If you compare 16 to 20, then 16 has the FinFET. And 16 will undoubtedly have even higher performance and lower power than 20. But 16 inherently is a more complex manufacturing process, and FinFETs are more difficult to design and require more manufacturing steps. Hence, they cost more. So you can achieve higher performance. You can achieve lower power. You can modulate between those 2. It's difficult for a given design to achieve cost reduction. So by definition, 16-nanometer addresses the high end of the product offering: communications -- Mil\/Aero wired communications, Mil\/Aero test and measurement, prototyping and less the other markets we address.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Victor.","Victor Peng","Thanks, Matt and good afternoon, everyone. Let me jump right into our results for the third quarter and provide an update on our expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Overall, the quarter played out largely as we anticipated. Total revenues were $723.5 million near the midpoint of our expected revenue range. We made a concerted effort to reduce operating expenses and achieve better-than-expected operating margin and GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 non-GAAP operating earnings per share of $0.68.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to highlights for the third quarter. The Advanced Products category constituted approximately 70% of total revenues in third quarter, a decrease of 4% year-over-year. Zynq-based revenue grew 26% year-over-year despite the impact of a weaker wired and wireless business. The Zynq SoC platform, which includes Zynq at 28 nanometer and both MPSoC and RFSoC at 16 nanometer, represented 23% of total revenues, which is higher than the year-ago period. We continue to see strong Zynq tracked in across our target markets, which is a positive indicator of our progression transitioning to platforms.","Our overall customer engagement momentum continues to build as we positioned for the long-term profitable growth by executing on our strategy of growth in the data center, 5G and the automotive market as well as accelerating growth in our core markets. In the communication markets, we are actively engaged with a global non-Chinese OEM for second generation 5G radio design that includes beamforming and is based on our 7-nanometer Versal ACAP. Beyond communications, Versal continues to be well received by customers across several end markets. Well, our production shipment of Versal is expected to begin in late FY 2021. We have already recognized initial revenue from early shipments to customers.","In the data center, Alibaba Cloud announced that Xilinx is powering the data center and is being used by their cloud services enterprise customers. They also shared that unprecedented traffic during Singles Day in China has proven the reliability and security of their systems platform running on RFPGAs. In addition Supermicro unveiled two new Alveo systems that power compute platforms to accelerate some of the most algorithmically demanding workloads in the enterprise and in the cloud.","On the software front, as announced earlier, the latest Vitis platform is now available for download and free to users, who purchased Alveo development board. We also announced the availability of the Vitis AI inference development platform that empowers software developers to utilize deep learning acceleration framework like TensorFlow and Caffe.","Lastly, we announced our Zynq MPSoC is powering Baidu\u2019s production-ready Apollo Computing Unit for automated valet parking, the industry\u2019s first dedicated computing solution for this emerging automotive application.","Moving to a review of our business groups and core markets of the third quarter. Our core markets performed as expected with some adjustments and mix across our AIT and ABC markets. We saw less-than-expected declines in A&D and ISM while macroeconomic and trade related headwinds impacted automotive more-than-expected. We saw increased revenue from emulation and prototyping customers in TME market, albeit somewhat less-than-expected. This mix of revenue helped drive a higher blended corporate gross margin in the quarter.","The data center group performed as expected and benefited from sales of both compute and networking products to hyperscale customers. Networking revenue from Solarflare somewhat outperformed expectations in the quarter. We also saw increased revenue from customers shipping storage class memory; however, this was offset by weaker demand from high-performance computing and some crypto customers. The wired and wireless group performed largely as anticipated with both wireless and wired down sequentially. Wireless revenue meaningfully declined because of the anticipated baseband ASIC transition and some program related delays with one of our global OEMs.","Now, moving onto the financials. As I mentioned, total revenue was $723.5 million down 10% year-over-year and down 13% sequentially. Data center group revenue increased 8% year-over-year that was down 16% sequentially from a record quarter. Wired and wireless group revenue declined 18% year-over-year and was down 29% sequentially. Note that we had one communications customer that represented greater than 10% of revenues in the third quarter. AIT revenue declined 10% year-over-year and was down 5% sequentially. ABC revenue increased 10% year-over-year and was up 2% sequentially.","Gross margin was in line with expectations with GAAP growth margin of 67% and non-GAAP gross margin of 68%. GAAP operating expense at $324 million and non-GAAP OpEx at $318 million were both meaningfully below guidance of $330 million due to significantly reduced hiring and discretionary spending.","GAAP operating income was $159 million or 22% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $174 million or 24% operating margin. Our GAAP tax rate was approximately 2% and non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 5%.","GAAP net income was $162 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.64, a 31% year-over-year decrease. Non-GAAP net income was $171 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.68, a 26% decline from last year. Diluted share count decreased to $252.8 million and gross cash was $2.4 billion with $1.2 billion in long-term debt. Accounts receivables decreased to $254 million and is at 32 days down from 37 days last quarter. Overall, we generated $324 million in operating cash flow. During the quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $93.70 per share and paid dividends of $93 million.","Turning now to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe Q3 will be our low quarter for fiscal 2020 from a revenue perspective. However, our revenue recovery is now expected to be more gradual than we had anticipated at the start of the last quarter. We expect total fourth quarter revenue to be between $750 million and $780 million, which at the midpoint of the guidance is down approximately 8% year-over-year, but up approximately 6% sequentially.","Fourth quarter revenue growth is being driven by meaningful improvement in our core markets and moderate growth in DCG, but it\u2019s significantly offset by greater-than-anticipated weakness in WWG. We expect modest growth from our distribution channel. For core markets, we are on track with our prior expectations for strong sequential revenue growth as programs for multiple emulation and prototyping customers\u2019 ramp. Both A&D and ISM are expected to be up in Q4. Auto is also expected to recover in Q4 as ADAS demand increases relative to Q3. AVP and consumer are expected to be somewhat weaker.","The DCG revenue is expected to grow moderately, albeit somewhat less than prior expectations. We expect continued contributions from compute acceleration driven by a mix of cloud and high performance compute customers. We expect to see slower revenue ramp from the storage and networking customers, and we expect additional cloud customer POCs to move into production. The revenue will likely continue to be lumpy given that we\u2019re in the early stages of scaling the DCG business.","The most significant change for outlook is in WWG. We now expect Q4 revenue from both wired and wireless customers has declined more than previously anticipated. The additional negative impact to our wireless business are a result of a slowdown in 5G rollout across multiple regions as many operators take a pause before the next wave of infrastructure deployment. In addition, wired revenues are being impacted by a broad based weakness in demand across multiple customers.","Now, that these headwinds are in addition to the impact of the loss of revenue from Huawei since last may. We now expect WWG revenue to be down in FY 2020 versus FY 2019. Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to improve to approximately 69.5%. Given the more persistent revenue headwinds we\u2019re facing, we\u2019re taking several actions to drive structural operating efficiencies across the company. We plan to reduce our global workforce by approximately 7% to a targeted reduction of force and meaningfully slower attrition replacement. In addition we are taking several actions to reduce discretionary spend and realize additional operating efficiencies across the business.","Excluding severance charges related to the reduction of force, non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be approximately $318 million, which reflects the adjusted spending profile. This includes approximately $17 million to $20 million of savings from various operating expense reduction actions we plan to take in the fourth quarter. This is offset by expenses related to 7-nanometer tape-out in the quarter and increased legal expenses.","Non-GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $8 million due primarily to an anticipated IP settlement for the customer that was recently acquired. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be approximately 8%.","In closing, we are faced with persistent trade-related impacts with our business and other headwinds. We were taking thoughtful and decisive actions that were painful, we believe are in the best interest of all Xilinx\u2019s stakeholders. We continue to see a great long-term opportunity in the second secular growth trends in data center, 5G infrastructure and automotive markets as well as TAM expansion and share gains across our foundational core markets. We remain extremely focused and committed to our strategy to drive profitable growth as a leader in adaptable platforms.","Operator, we now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joe Moore","Great, thank you. I wonder before you had said that the impact of the baseband transition would be largely done by the March quarter is that still the case and what are you \u2013 what are you kind of thinking about the progression of wireless beyond that particularly as you know, assuming that we don\u2019t get Huawei back into the mix. Can you grow from there? Is it going to take awhile? Just what do you think is the progression there?","Victor Peng","Yes, Joe, I mean, what we said is the baseband impact did occur in the last quarter as expected. So that\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re correct, if you\u2019re applying, that\u2019s not new news. You\u2019re right. That\u2019s not new news. Really, the additional pressure we\u2019re feeling in the current quarter is from slowdown in the deployments across multiple geographies and then both weakness \u2013 both on the wireless side as well on the wired side. That level of weakness we did not anticipate last quarter when you kind of gave the overall guide for the second half.","In terms of how we see things going forward, we\u2019re not giving guidance for FY 2021, but I guess in a broader picture what I would say is, clearly, in the near-term, we have some meaningful headwinds here, Huawei remains on the entity list. but I really think that from that perspective, we don\u2019t think about that is even if that were to change in the entity list that account revenue would be at levels that it used to be. I think it\u2019s just the reality of it and that\u2019s how we think about it now. However, we\u2019re still relatively speaking in the first days of the point for 5G. And you\u2019ve heard me and I\u2019m sure other people talk about when we talked to all our customers, they see like three waves of technology rollouts. and so it\u2019s certainly been more challenges first wave, but when we think about the longer-term, we still think this is a good growth opportunity design. Particularly, because we\u2019ve been innovating with things like RFSoC and Versal ACAP. And we\u2019ve got really good engagement as I had reviewed my prepared comments already with some customers for the second generation, and that\u2019s actually using our some non-Versal ACAP. So, that\u2019s how we think about the big picture.","Joe Moore","Great. And just to clarify my question in terms of the baseband transition. is there an ongoing headwind beyond the March quarter or is the impact to that kind of mostly done in the current quarter?","Victor Peng","I guess, we \u2013 the way we think about it, it\u2019s mostly done, it\u2019s factored in. Exactly. It\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not like a one-time event. It was we expected it would happen. It did happen in that quarter and we keep it out.","Joe Moore","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari","Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the question. Victor, when you were talking about the wireless business in your prepared remarks, you talked about the ASIC transition, you mentioned something about our program delay on one of your customers, how significant or insignificant were those two dynamics in the December quarter? And I guess more importantly, at your Investor Day, you guys talked about three to four X more opportunity in 5G relative to 4G given more base stations, higher content and higher market share. Outside of Huawei, having issues, has anything changed there or is everything still very much intact long-term? Thank you.","Victor Peng","Sure. Let me do the last portion first, it\u2019s exactly as you said, Huawei is significant, but if you sort of \u2013 okay, understand that and move on from that, we still do think it\u2019s a significantly larger opportunity than 4G. Now back to sort of the issue around one customers program delay, really the bigger hired a bit on the headwinds that we\u2019re seeing in Q4 causing us to see a more gradual recovery from the Q3, which we didn\u2019t anticipate was going to be kind of a confluence of a kind of a perfect storm thing. Is really the general slowdown deployment in multiple geographies and that\u2019s affected, essentially all the OEMs that we\u2019re working with, right, that we\u2019re still working with and allowed to work with. The program delay was another factor, but I think the way you should think about it is the highest order bit is just a pause or slower deployment that we are seeing across from the carriers and that\u2019s reflected in the OEM customers that we have in multiple of them in all the different regions.","Toshiya Hari","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Christopher Rolland","Hey guys, thanks for the question. So, I guess first on WWG. So, this pause, is it purely geographic or is it also, does it have something to do with the applications that are addressing, for example, moving from basebands, remote radio head or to massive MIMO. And then if you could talk about where we are with RFSoC and how you think that rollout will go?","Victor Peng","Yes. On the broader question, I don\u2019t think it has to do with a rollout of a particular technology and you\u2019re right; there are different types of technologies that fall under the umbrella of 5G. It just seems as though the multiple operators that cover multiple regions are done some initial deployments and are just taking a pause, my position is that they\u2019re seeking more profitability for they further invest. But in any event, we talked to both carriers as well as our OEMs and we see that fairly broad. So, I guess again then in terms of the longer-term view and all that, again, I think that the long-term view still seems very \u2013 like a very good opportunity for us. And again, we have to keep in perspective that we\u2019re only in the very first phase and deployments will come back, it\u2019s just like we have a pause right now that we didn\u2019t anticipate.","Christopher Rolland","Great. And then on data center\u2026","Victor Peng","I\u2019m sorry, what I just realized, I didn\u2019t quite answer your RFSoC.","Christopher Rolland","Oh, sorry.","Victor Peng","So RFSoC, we do have that being deployed and with different OEMs that cover different multiple regions as well, both in sub-segs, but also we think there\u2019s some strength there in millimeter wave bands. We\u2019re still relatively speaking in the early stages, but it is deployed. So, it is out there in the multiple regions and through multiple OEMs. So, I apologize, I didn\u2019t quite cover that initially.","Christopher Rolland","No problem. Thank you, Victor. And on the data center side, a nice progress on the Alveo cards. But I think in your roadmap, you had AI core either coming out soon or actually maybe even sampling now. Maybe, talk about where we are there and have you had any feedback from any hyperscalers or customers?","Victor Peng","Yes, I think so. I think when you\u2019re talking about the AI engine, I think that\u2019s respect to our Versal product and we do have some \u2013 the early Versal development board. So, just to clarify some of the brand names. I think there is good excitement in multiple markets; I kind of alluded to the 5G, but certainly, in data center, that\u2019s being evaluated and also in other markets as well, even in \u2013 let\u2019s see one application that even though it\u2019s just in the initial silicon, people are already doing some deployments in terms of a very high-resolution camera, where they\u2019re also doing some image recognition to do some augmented reality for an interesting entertainment experience.","And so I think that\u2019s a good indicator of not only the quality of our initial silicon, but also the breadth that people are using AI on that platform, not just in what\u2019s considered the cloud, but maybe, you would call that, some people might call that an edge application, right. So, it\u2019s still early days, but it was \u2013 we\u2019re pretty excited about the diversity and the traction that we\u2019re getting.","Christopher Rolland","Thanks, Victor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.","CJ Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a question on the restructuring. Can you walk through what is permanent versus temporary and can you help us kind of understand how you will plan to deliver both the operating margins in this more subdued environment as well as obviously invest, I guess most importantly in the coming \u2013 as well as the software stack in the coming few years? Thank you.","Victor Peng","Yes, CJ. it\u2019s a good question. Look, I mean, now when we first started seeing some weakness, we took some proactive actions to control our expenses that\u2019s reflected in the Q3. Really what happened is, late in the year, as we saw that some of these headwinds that we just walked through were more severe and also, I think the ongoing persistent effects of the whole China-U.S. trade situation and the Huawei business that reflected, it was clear that we had to do something that was more structural, right. It was very painful something for us as a company to impact some of our employees. But a good portion of this it is a matter of reducing labor and that\u2019s both from that targeted reduction in force as well as significantly controlling even attrition replacement. So, that labor component obviously is an ongoing thing.","Now, some of the other things that we\u2019re doing just many other actions in terms of discretionary spend, but we also even looked at programs. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re alluding to. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about that of course; because our goal and I think we\u2019ve achieved that and how we\u2019re coming out here is to not further impact both near-term business nor degrade our long-term opportunity, which we remain very confident in.","And I think you heard me mention in the prepared remarks that we expect a certain level of OpEx savings in the quarter, but we\u2019re doing a tape-out in seven nanometer in the quarter. So that somewhat offsets all of that. So, we are still very much committed to executing sort of strategy. And I think, again, there\u2019s some difficult decisions here, but I think we\u2019ve struck a good balance of things that will bring us in a more reasonable profitability profile, like you said, in a more subdued, near-term revenue environment, but not in any way materially impacting anything in the future or for that matter, even the near-term business.","I do think that as we drive in recovering, grow out of it, those position knows to have maybe more efficiency in the business and leverage, because we will watch very carefully our OpEx even as we get back towards growth trends.","CJ Muse","Thank you.","Victor Peng","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra","Hi, good afternoon. Could you give us some color on the weakness you see in the wired business? Also, I\u2019m trying to reconcile the commentary that 5g wireless deployments are taking a pause across geographies, but in the U.S., the ramp has barely started. So maybe, if you could elaborate and I know you\u2019ve already got a few questions on the topic, but if you could elaborate on the reasons of the pause and when do you expect to rebound and with the specifically ramp in the U.S.?","Victor Peng","Yes. I mean, as you know, we really serve virtually all the OEMs that support all the different geographies, including of course, the U.S. and without getting into specific customers. We do see the broad softness and feedback we\u2019re getting is because they\u2019re also not seeing some demand materialize across the regions and that includes the U.S. I do think that this is not necessarily something that is it\u2019s hard to tell the visibility right now, but I don\u2019t think this is something that\u2019s going to necessarily persist until the second wave comes. It\u2019s just that clearly after they\u2019ve done some deployment, it just appears from both when we talked to carriers as well, the multiple OEMs that there seems to be a pause now and again, we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s what we see right now.","Yes, it\u2019s hard for us to predict exactly the timing of when that rule restarts. But again, I come back to, when I look at the engagements, we already have going actively in the next wave of equipment. I feel good about that we still have good opportunity there. and when there\u2019s more deployment, the current generation of equipment, then obviously, that could also help our business recover.","Tristan Gerra","Okay. And then could you give us a quick sense of your mix at seven nanometer versus 16 nanometer?","Victor Peng","Yes. 16 is \u2013 16 nanometer is our portfolio there is on track to break all the records that we have and we hold the most successful product family in the programmable space with our seventh series back in the 20 nanometer generation. We\u2019re clearly outpacing that and that\u2019s due not only to the fact that, we are out executed, but the innovations we have with MPSoC, RFSoC and a number of other areas, that\u2019s tremendously successful and that revenue is going to continue to grow for some number of years.","Seven nanometers, remember is just still in the sampling stage, right? So, we\u2019re not in the production. But we\u2019re getting very good traction and I mentioned multiple markets, communications. And one area that more of you know, video and broadcast kind of area, data center, we\u2019re getting good looks, aerospace and defense, a lot of strong demand. But that will take time as it usually does for us in some of these markets to ramp to sort of more meaningful revenue. But we have a lot of revenue already, particularly in the development board. So, a very encouraging sign.","Tristan Gerra","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your line is open.","Matt Ramsay","Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Victor, I wanted to ask \u2013 and I guess it\u2019s a little bit related to CJ\u2019s question on the reduction in force, but more specifically, as you guys look at prudent cost cuts and the like going forward, the level of investment and has that level of investment changed in the Vitis software stack that you guys introduced? And I guess the second part of the question is separate from the investment, how the early engagement being on that software stack with customers across the business. And if there\u2019s anything to highlight there on that progression, that would be really helpful. Thank you.","Victor Peng","Okay. Yes. Yes, thanks. maybe, I didn\u2019t touch on that part of it. first, I guess, so we\u2019re going to like to say on a relative basis, some of the labor related productions that we\u2019re doing on a relative basis, we\u2019re doing more in SG&A than in R&D in general, okay. We are also again, continuing to invest in the areas that are critical for our growth. So, I think you\u2019re both making the point that it\u2019s not just silicon roadmap, it\u2019s also what we\u2019re doing on the software IP and so forth and we fully agree. So, my comments weren\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t mean to sort of imply that we just looked at tape-out.","We are also \u2013 yes, we are also focused more on everything we need, all the items we need to execute towards strategy and move into platforms and be a much more mainstream targeted platform. Everything we see in terms of, for instance, Vitis those be dial-ins when we announced new webinars or training, they fill out immediately. So that\u2019s really encouraging. I know at the end of the day, everyone\u2019s \u2013 as we certainly are looking for the revenue, but when I look at other things to measure in terms of developers, in terms of just hits we get on various videos that we do in training. It\u2019s all looking very promising. So\u2026","Matt Ramsay","Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. In the data center portfolio, I wanted to ask you to give us an update on the traction you guys might be having on the design win side and the SmartNIC space and if that revenue can be material to the company over the next 12, 18 months. Thanks.","Victor Peng","Yes, I think, I kind of mentioned that for instance, Solarflare revenue last quarter was a little higher-than-expected. I think that was a record for them. It\u2019s still relatively modest revenue. I think that does bode well. And we \u2013 that integration is going very well. And clearly, I think the position will get even stronger when we really fully realize all the positive synergies of their expertise in software and system level expertise with our execution on hardware platform. So, I do think, that the smartNIC opportunity is significant. And I think thinking in terms of a year and beyond is reasonable. And I think it\u2019ll be \u2013 it\u2019ll grow for multiple years.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you. Victor, I just had a question on the ASIC transition that you experienced this time. And you said that this was a \u2013 so this is the one-time and it\u2019s done, but when wireless starts to ramp again, why should it not occur again, i.e. you see growth and then you\u2019ll see a headwind again? just kind of help us understand the dynamic and why would this not repeat or would it repeat again, was my first question. And the second was, given the \u2013 what seems to be a pretty sizable reduction, what does it say about the longer-term mid-teens growth target that you have laid out for the company? Thank you.","Victor Peng","Yes. look, on the first part, I think when we said that we expected ASIC replacement in the basement. I think from the very early stages when we had strong upside and in 5g deployment, we said that we ordinarily don\u2019t get baseband wins and because there was an early rapid deployment in South Korea and the only way anybody can get the market was using our technology, which is one of the value adds that we had was we now enable people to be agile and get things to market quickly. We had that, but we didn\u2019t expect longevity there.","I know it\u2019s a competitive marketplace, everybody hears about that. but I want to bring people back to, we\u2019ve competed against ASIC at our customers for well over a decade. I mean Huawei has high silicon and has had high silicon for a long time. Clearly, everybody is aware that there was a meaningful impact when we couldn\u2019t ship the Huawei and clearly, we weren\u2019t totally replaced by ASIC by high silicon Huawei. That\u2019s just one example. I mean, I know you guys are familiar with all the other OEMs they have ASIC teams, right? So, this is nothing new. and I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t take that lightly, by any means either. I think we are able to still win against ASIC, even our own customers, because we are continuing to innovate \u2013 innovative with things like RFSoC, with things like Versal on the software and IP side.","So yes, look, I mean, could this happen again? It could. but we traditionally have really good strength in radio. We\u2019re innovating, we\u2019re moving rapidly and we continue to be very focused on this business. So, we maintain that we feel like in the long-term that this is a very big opportunity despite those very significant impacts of the trade situation here. So that was all on the ASIC side, so I\u2019m sorry, can you repeat the second part of question?","Ambrish Srivastava","Yes. Yes. So that\u2019s helpful perspective. Thanks for that. What I was asking was given the reduction what seems that, I can\u2019t remember the last time we saw such a big reduction for you guys, but what does that speak to the mid-teens growth that you have laid out for the company.","Victor Peng","Yes. Look, I \u2013 we\u2019re not, as I said before, we\u2019re not going to give guidance of FY 2021 now. We look to do that in the next call. But what I would say is that we absolutely are committed to getting back to double-digit growth. I think this is a recognition of the fact that it\u2019s going to come up a little bit more gradually to get to that kind of a run rate. We\u2019re committed to doing that and we\u2019ve recognized that because it is going to take longer. We\u2019ve had to take some difficult steps here, but I think we\u2019re building this to \u2013 continue to execute our strategy and fulfill, I think, a very significant opportunity we have not only 5G, but again, data center, our core markets and in automotive as well.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. Thank you. Good luck.","Victor Peng","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Jihan Shang","Hi, this is Jihan for Ross. Thank you for letting me ask the question. It looks like DCG, even with some moderating growth in the March quarter; looks to be potentially up 20% for the year versus the prior guidance were up 30%. So, I guess what has changed in DCG growth? Are some of the transitions from a customer proof-of-concept to production actually being moving slower-than-expected previously?","Victor Peng","Yes. Look, I mean we\u2019re not giving you an overall reassessment of that. But I think, the takeaways, it is still growing double-digit. And in fact, when we close out this fiscal year, that\u2019d be two consecutive years of double-digit. I think in general, it\u2019s still a reflection as you said some of these things like proof-of-concept have taken a bit longer. I think it\u2019s also just, we\u2019re growing the business. It\u2019s an emerging market. it\u2019s not quite scale, where you get the usual puts and takes of certain things are maybe, a little bit slower than you get other upsides, it\u2019s fairly small business so far in an absolute sense, even though it\u2019s growing very well.","And I think I\u2019ve said on a previous call that as we get the higher scale and just more diversity of design wins and different timing of the different programs that we\u2019ll see less quarter-to-quarter volatility. But I do think, for the continued near-term, I think, the better measure to see is where are we sustaining that good double-digit kind of growth and the quality of kind of wins that we get the engagements that we have and on those bases, we\u2019re still feeling very good about the business.","Jihan Shang","Okay. Thank you. And if we just compare as Xilinx\u2019s growth to Intel's PSG business, clearly the company, Xilinx has had some good market share gains in the last calendar year. So, I guess even within the head face of Huawei challenges. So, I guess can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamic?","Victor Peng","Yes. I mentioned a few times in my prepared markets that our core markets, it\u2019s a key part of our strategy to continue to accelerate growth in our core markets. And if you look at how that played out, I mean our core markets are growing very solidly, right? And to your point, some of that is share gains, some of it\u2019s also TAM expansion, right? Those markets have different types of profiles, if you will, in terms of how quickly things move to market. But even in those markets, we\u2019re seeing the transitions of Zynq being very, very strong; RFSoC, a strong interest in some early design and activity that haven\u2019t fully played out, just because the time constant tends to be a little bit longer, but it\u2019s a key to our business and has been progressing quite well and we do fully expect to continue to take share, but also grow the TAM, right.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from bank of America. Your line is open.","Jamie Zakalik","Hi, this is Jamie Zakalik on for Vivek. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Is the pace of 5g FPGA replacement similar to the pace that you\u2019ve seen in past cycles and is this a replacement limited to the baseband? And then on the radio side, do you see Marvell\u2019s Avera business as a direct competitor in the digital front-end or is it more a complimentary product?","Victor Peng","I guess first, the thing of how to think about as 5g similar to the 4g or what is the level of similarity? And I really must say, I know that there\u2019s been a lot of marketing hype around 5G, but I really must say it is a radically more disruptive standards, set of standards and sets of technologies. So, I think it is significantly different, which is why we and many other companies have invested so much and are saying how it\u2019s going to be changed; once it\u2019s fully deployed, how much will it change things from your automobiles, the homes, the IoT, it\u2019s simply not data and voice, right, which works 4G is all about. So, I really do think it is meaningfully different even when you cut through some of the marketing buzz.","Now, in our side of it, where also the value we deliver to our customers in 5G is meaningfully different to, meaningfully upgraded, right. A good \u2013 a good portion of our products are not just pure FPGAs and our \u2013 now state-of-the-art FPGAs are so much more powerful than back in the 4g era. So, I think on both fronts, the opportunity, the magnitude of disruption is larger. And then what we bring to the table is larger. on the competition side, everybody\u2019s up their game. There\u2019s a lot of people that have been consolidated out. the players left are pretty good at what they do, right, ourselves included. I don\u2019t want to get into specifics about a specific competitor. All I would say again is it\u2019s not anything new for us to compete with ASIC solutions with ASSP solutions. including ASIC solutions from our own customers, it\u2019s not new. It\u2019s not easy and we have to create real value. We have to provide excellent support, great quality and those are the things that we\u2019ve been doing, and that\u2019s what we will remain focused on.","Jamie Zakalik","Great. And then on \u2013 a quick follow-up, you mentioned one customer, I think that was greater than 10% of sales in Q3. Could you give some details on who this customer was? Was it Huawei? If not, could you give any details on what percent of revenue Huawei was in the quarter and just confirm that you\u2019re still removing Huawei from forward-looking guide? Thank you.","Victor Peng","Okay, so quick clarification. We don\u2019t have any meaningful revenue from Huawei, because there\u2019s still only entities with. So \u2013 and we had taken Huawei out starting from the last quarter like comments about Huawei is really about, even on a go-forward basis, even if they were moved from any, it\u2019s pretty clear now. Given that they\u2019ve remained only in the list as long as they have that, that revenue will never be at the level that we used to have. So, it\u2019s definitely not Huawei, but we don\u2019t share the details of the specific customer for 10%.","Jamie Zakalik","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to mr. Victor Peng, CEO for some closing remarks.","Victor Peng","Okay. Yes. Look, before we close the end of this call, I just want to share that clearly, not where we expect to be if we go back to the start of this fiscal year. I think the unprecedented change in U.S.-China relations in trade, clearly, has an impact on the industry and specifically, our business and at a time that\u2019s really unfortunate right at the beginning of deployment of 5G. We proactively made some very difficult decisions including the very painful one of doing a targeted reduction in force. But I think that is the appropriate thing to do, given a slower, a near-term revenue growth trajectory. And I think what that does do is, again position us very well once we get back to a growth trajectory in terms of efficiency in the business and leverage. But I think it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the fact that our core markets as we\u2019ve discussed a few times, both in prepared marks as well as in the QA is very, very solid. It\u2019s growing very well on an annual basis. It\u2019s a core part of our strategy to accelerate that growth.","At the same time, data center business, while it\u2019s an emerging market and still not fully at scale, tends out some worthiness [ph] from a quarter-to-quarter basis, it looks like we will achieve double-digit growth on an annual basis for two consecutive years. And we continue to see greater opportunity there. And even with 5G, we\u2019ve talked about that quite a bit. It is important to remember we\u2019re still in the relatively early innings on 5G and it started out much stronger and earlier than people predicted. Now, we\u2019re having a soft spot, but we\u2019re engaged. We have the right kind of engagements with top OEMs and there\u2019s still may more innings to come. So, we remain bullish in terms of our overall long-term outlook in those growth drivers.","So with that, thank you for being on the call and turn it back over to Matt.","Matt Poirier","So, thanks for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin your conference.","Matt Poirier","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter and the business outlook for the December quarter and full-year fiscal 2020.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events, or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","In addition to GAAP financial measures, we will be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions.

This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Victor.","Victor Peng","Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and provide an update on our expectations for the third quarter and the remainder of the year.","For Q2, we achieved sales of 833 million, which exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance, despite the impact of continuing trade restrictions with Huawei. DCG business bounced back as expected and had a very strong quarter with record revenue of 81 million, which represented 92% sequential and 24% year-over-year growth. This result was primarily driven by growth in sales to storage customers with some additional hyperscale customer demand and limited growth from cryptocurrency customers.","In our core vertical markets, ABC revenues were in line with expectations, while AIT revenues were better than expected. WWG revenues were weaker than anticipated due to minimal sales of permissible products to Huawei. While we expedited our application process to the Department of Commerce in early Q2, we have not received any license approvals to expand the product set permissible to sell to Huawei.","Through the first-half of fiscal 2020, we recognized revenue of approximately 50 million from Huawei, with the vast majority of that coming \u2013 that total coming in Q1 before restrictions were announced. Multiple research analysts had estimated our full-year revenue exposure to Huawei at approximately 6% to 8% of our total revenue, which is in the range of what we are anticipating at the beginning of the fiscal year.","Considering the continued trade restrictions with Huawei and the uncertainty presented to our business, we believe it is prudent to remove all remaining revenue expectations related to Huawei from our fiscal 2020 outlook. Huawei is an important customer and we hope that an agreement between the U.S. and Chinese governments is reached as soon as possible, so we can resume engaging in a manner consistent with an important customer.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to some additional highlights for the second quarter. Revenue from our Advanced Products grew 29% year-over-year and represented approximately 74% of total sales. We saw broad based demand for our 16 nanometer UltraScale+ family, which continues to be a strong revenue driver for our business.","Demand for our Zynq platform also continues to be strong, driven by the adoption of MPSoC in wireless applications as well as across our core vertical markets, particularly in our auto business. Our RFSoC is also deployed with multiple wireless customers and is being evaluated by many customers in other end markets.","Overall, revenue for our Zynq family grew 61% year-over-year, which represented approximately 26% of total revenue in Q2. Customer feedback related to our Zynq family has been remarkable and gives us significant confidence in our transformation to a platform company.","We hosted over 1,300 attendees at our Xilinx Developer Forum in San Jose earlier this month. At this sold-out event, we announced a breakthrough in a new, unified, open source software platform called Vitis. We expect that over time, Vitis will drive significantly more Xilinx platform engagement with software developers and data scientists.","We continue to make good progress building out our global ecosystem of partners, customers, developers and applications, which now has reached nearly 7,000 developers over 750 IOCs [ph] and includes more than 90 applications now in production. We announced engagement with Microsoft Azure, which further demonstrates the breadth of hyperscale\/hyperscaler relationships, which include Amazon, Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei, and Tencent.","Microsoft announced that it will be deploying Alveo U250 accelerator cards in its Azure cloud. Amazon announced that it has expanded its EC2 F1 instances; and additionally, they are adapting SageMaker Neo to run on Xilinx technology.","Samsung shared a collaboration on leveraging Versal ACAP to enable their next-generation of 5G solutions. We also saw many key ecosystem partners demonstrate examples of FPGAs being used for workload acceleration at the datacenter with increased presence of SmartSSDs and SmartNICs. Considering a challenging business environment, I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make with our strategy and platform transformation.","I'll pause here and hand the call over to Lorenzo to walk you through the financials for the fiscal second quarter.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you, Victor. Before I go into the results, I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you with whom I've had the pleasure of working with over the last decade. I sincerely wish all of you, and of course, the great team here at Xilinx, all the best in the future.","Now, on to the fiscal second quarter results. Overall, our business performed well this quarter and we were able to exceed the midpoint of our revenue guidance. Total revenue was in line with guidance at $833 million, up 12% year-over-year, but down 2% sequentially.","Wired and Wireless Group grew revenue 24% year-over-year, but declined 8% quarter-over-quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, wireless was flat, as our diverse customer base showed strength despite the Huawei shipping restrictions. Wired business declined significantly quarter-to-quarter, due to Huawei and softness from other customers.","Note, we had one communications customer that represented approximately 12% of the quarterly revenue in Q2. Revenue from the datacenter group increased 24% year-over-year and 92% quarter-over-quarter. We saw better than expected strength from one of our storage customers. We also had growth in multiple hyperscalers and broader accounts despite the Huawei ban.","Finally, we had approximately $5 million in revenue from Solarflare this quarter. AIT grew 7% year-over-year but declined 9% quarter-on-quarter. Year-over-year, we saw significant strength in A&D and flatness in Industrial. TME did decline significantly. This was as expected and is due to a specific customer program we have highlighted previously. Quarter-on-quarter, our decline was primarily due to TME and Industrial, partially offset by the strength in A&D.","In ABC, we continue our strong long-term growth trend with 9% growth year-over-year. Quarter-to-quarter, we grew 6%. Both year-over-year and sequential growth were driven by double-digit growth in our auto business. Broadcast also grew both on a quarterly and year-over-year basis, although consumer was down sequentially and year-over-year.","Gross margin was lower than expectations with GAAP gross margin of 65% and non-GAAP gross margin of 66%. Gross margin was impacted by product and customer mix in AIT and customer mix in DCG. As a reminder, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP is due to M&A-related amortization.","GAAP OpEx at $337 million and non-GAAP OpEx at $331 million were both below expectations. Non-GAAP operating expense, excluding Solarflare was $321 million below our guide of $322 million. Solarflare, which closed on July 31, contributed around $10 million to OpEx in Q2.","GAAP operating income was $204 million or 24% operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income was $217 million or 26% operating margin. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were approximately negative 5%. We had expected a low rate this quarter due to the tax accounting rules for share-based compensation.","GAAP net income was $227 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.89. GAAP EPS grew 6% year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $240 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.94 a share, yielding an 8% growth over last year. Diluted share count decreased to 255 million shares.","Next, I'll cover a few key points on the balance sheet and cash flow. Gross cash was $2.5 billion, with $1.2 billion in long-term debt. Accounts receivable increased to $335 million and is at 37 days, still within our normal operating range. Overall, we generated $224 million in operating cash flow. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at an average price of $103.60 per share and paid dividends of $93 million.","Finally, the Board of Directors of Xilinx have approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1 billion. Note that we aren't providing details on the timing and exact number of common shares to be purchased as that will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors.","Now, let me turn the call back to Victor for comments regarding the business outlook. Victor?","Victor Peng","Thanks, Lorenzo. And let me take this opportunity to express to you on behalf of the company and personally our appreciation and gratitude for all your contributions and accomplishments over the last decade at Xilinx. Thank you so much, Lorenzo.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you, Victor.","Victor Peng","And now turning to our outlook. For fiscal Q3, we expect revenue between $710 million and $740 million, which is a decrease of 9% year-on-year and 13% sequentially. This drop is due to several headwinds that coincide in the quarter that I'll explain. That said, we're expecting Q3 to be a bottom with strong rebound in Q4.","So, DCG revenue is expected to be slightly down in Q3, with more meaningful growth resuming in the fourth quarter. We are seeing a pause in hyper scale customer orders in Q3, but expect growth to resume in Q4, as customer POC transitions to production.","We also expect continuing contributions from storage and networking customers, including those from Solarflare. We expect crypto contribution to moderate over time from low teens and millions of single-digit billions that we moved into Q4.","For WWG, we expect revenues to be meaningfully lower in both the third and fourth quarters. This is principally due to the removal of running your expectations from Huawei, in addition to the expected transition to ASIC for select base band products previously discussed. We expect our revenue from our wired business to recover somewhat in the fourth quarter, while wireless remains weak.","Lastly, we're seeing global trade uncertainty causing some customers to exercise caution in ordering, as well as some slower than expected customer ramp. For our core vertical markets, revenue is expected to be flat in the third quarter and up in the fourth quarter. Q3 revenue will be lower than prior expectations, primarily due to macroeconomic-related headwinds. The increase in growth in Q4 is expected to come from a broad base of customers, including TME, aerospace and defense, automotive, and industrial customers.","Fiscal Q3 non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be between 67% to 69%, which is a return to our historical range with a less wireless heavy product mix. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be approximate $33 million. Non-GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $1 million, and our tax rate is expected to be between 4% to 6%.","Now turning to FY 2020 outlook. We expect total revenue to be between $3.21 billion and $3.28 billion. We expect the second-half of FY 2020 to be down relative to the first-half of the year, with an expectation for strong sequential growth in fiscal Q4 following the bottom in fiscal Q3. This represents approximately 6% year-over-year growth following a record FY 2019. This performance is a testament to the durability of a model, given that we haven't been able to ship to \u2013 ship fully to an important customer since mid-Q1 and the current global trade uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds.","We expect in FY 2020 non-GAAP gross margin range between 66.5% to 68.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.3 billion for the year. This is approximately [$50 million] lower than prior expectations at Analyst Day and reflects the active expense management that we have put in place for the second-half of the year, given the current business conditions.","Note that, when normalizing for the incremental expense of recent acquisitions, our operating expense is now expected to be approximately $80 million lower than our expectations at the start of the fiscal year. Non-GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $25 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 4% to 5%.","Now, I'll take a few minutes to provide some additional color on business units and core vertical markets as we head into the back-half of the year. For DCG, we expect FY 2020 revenues to grow approximately 30% relative to FY 2019 revenue. We have continued to build out our capabilities as we address a dynamic datacenter market that has continued to evolve as customers are evaluating the use of FPGAs for compute, network and storage acceleration.","Despite a slower start in the first-half of the year and learning the impact of Huawei trade restrictions, we are expecting stronger growth in the second-half that builds on the progress we made with other hyper scale customers, both in the U.S. and in China. Now in compute, we continue to expand our FaaS platform with all the key hyper scale customers. We have built deep engagements with both enterprise and hyper scalars to bring real-time video streaming and database acceleration programs to production.","Now in some cases, the qualification time needed to reach production deployments is taking longer than expected. This has moderated the revenue growth rate we had anticipated at the start of FY 2020. These expanded timelines weren\u2019t in our original model, but we have now factored that into our outlook going forward. With the launch of Vitis, we expect that over time, customers will be able to develop and deploy our boards into production more rapidly. ","In storage, we expect the computational storage and SmartSSD market to continue to be a significant growth driver, with key customers, including Micron and Samsung. At the Flash Memory Summit in August, we showcased 14 separate partners with computational storage platforms each using Xilinx products. In networking, we have meaningfully integrated our Solarflare team and we have strong engineering engagement with multiple hyper scalars. We believe we're well-positioned to compete in the early stages of a growing SmartNIC market.","Last thing on DCG, we expect revenue volatility to abate over time as a diversity of our customer base increases and our revenue reaches a higher run rate. Now for WWG, we expect revenue to be flat year-over-year relative to FY 2019, including the impact of the Huawei trade restrictions. Without the Huawei impact, our WWG has performed roughly in line with the expectations we shared at the Analyst Day in May.","Our first-half wireless revenue benefited from early 5G deployments, mainly in South Korea and China and a modest amount in other markets. Our second-half is more challenged, given the expected base band ASIC transition and unexpected program delays with some communication customers. That said, this ASIC transition will be largely completed in the fourth quarter.","Keep in mind that we\u2019re just at the beginning of the global 5G roll out, which remains a significant opportunity for Xilinx over the coming years, but we\u2019ll continue to be somewhat lumpy. Going forward, given our market leadership position versus the competition and our capabilities in RF design, we're well-positioned to grow our wireless business as the intended density increases in the [right to head] with new 5G deployments.","For our core vertical markets, we now expect FY 2020 revenues to grow high-single digits year-over-year. While revenue in the first-half of FY 2020 grew close to our expectations, we are seeing macroeconomic-related headwinds impacting customer demand in both AIT and ABC markets in Q3.","Additionally, we are expecting revenue from a planned program wrap at a key emulation and prototyping customer, but that will extend over somewhat longer period beyond FY 2020 and into FY 2021. However, we expect strong customer demand from a broad range of customers, TME, ISM, A&D, and auto coming in Q4. We also expect modest growth in distribution channel demand in Q4 in anticipation of some growth in our broad markets heading into FY 2021.","So, in closing, we are executing the strategy we outlined at our Analyst Day in May, as we believe it's the right long-term path to Xilinx, despite some near-term headwinds. Xilinx remains well-positioned to capitalize on the secular growth trends that will continue to driving our business for years to come. We will continue to invest in growth, in line with our strategy or actively moderating our R&D and overall operating expenses, given the current business environment.","We\u2019ll now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to stick with the full-year fiscal year guidance Victor. What gives you the confidence? Is it pretty large Q-over-Q embedded in the 6% growth? So, notoriously, current requirements are higher for the business. So, sitting here, how can you \u2013 what gives you the confidence on that growth for the fourth quarter?","Victor Peng","Yes. I think, from a sequential perspective, our Q3, as I said in my prepared remarks, that had a coincidence of a bunch of headwinds occurring sort of at the same time, right, some of which, as we said, we expected some of which were not expected. So, I would say, one thing is just a contrast to that. But we do have strong confidence in Q4, because it is broad across a number of things, including some strong wins that we have that we're tracking very closely and clearly are going to move as expected, right? So, I mean, obviously, I think it's really a contrast of the Q3 to the Q4, but we feel we have good visibility into Q4.","Ambrish Srivastava","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra of Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra","Hi. What are you seeing in terms of the base station build activity in China, given the U.S. ban? Is that still ongoing or has that changed significantly in the quarter? And where do you see meaningful diversification with shipments in base station outside of Huawei?","Victor Peng","So, from what we see, we do think that there are approximately on the path of the base station deployments they said they were initially going to do in China. Clearly, the Huawei had a significant impact, but they're not our only customer in China. So, we are still participating in China deployment. Clearly, though, Huawei has a big impact.","I think there are some second order things, too, but I think it's probably simple to say that overall, I think it sounds like the first point is about on track, we are participating, but not with one of the top players.","Tristan Gerra","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Danely of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Chris Danely","Hi, guys. Just a question on taking Huawei to zero. It seems like most of the other semi companies have kind of restored anywhere from two-thirds to three-fourths of their shipments to them. Can you just elaborate on why you're not doing that versus it seems like most other semis have already started to reship?","Victor Peng","Again, I can't really speak to how other customers justify, how they believe they can ship. We obviously have been tracking this extremely carefully with our internal and external counsel. We talked to the Department of Commerce. We applied, as I said in our prepared remarks, our licenses, none of those have come through. I guess, one thing I would say is that, many people supply to Huawei, because they have a very diversified business. 5G being explicitly cited as the security issue, there could be differences there. But all I can say is that, we're following all the rules and regulations. But we're carefully monitoring this and we put in licenses and we just haven't had anything approved yet.","Chris Danely","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Victor Peng","Yes.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Caso of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Chris Caso","Yes, thank you. Just a little bit of color on what's going on with the DCG. And I guess, with the lowered guidance as compared to the Analyst Day, maybe you can break out what \u2013 what's changing your thinking? How much of that was attributed to Huawei, because I believe that was a customer in DCG? And how much of it is just customers being a little bit slower to adopt solutions or perhaps this is indicative of the economic environment as well? Thanks.","Victor Peng","Actually, you did a fairly good job hitting some of the points. I mean, I \u2013 in complete candor, and as I said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing great traction. The opportunities still continue to be really great, but we have learned that in some cases getting to that production from proof-of-concepts, what I refer to as POCs, and also just qualification of some, that is taking a bit longer than we expected and just we hadn't anticipated. But as we \u2013 as I said, we have now folded that into our go-forward, so that's one thing.","The other thing is, you hit it exactly right. Huawei did have an FPGA as a Service, FaaS program and we had to stop that. We're still working through things around that, but that had an impact. And then I would say that there was, as we expressed some digestion, some pullback.","Having said all of that, our second half is quite a bit stronger than our first and 30% growth is our estimate if we come in midpoint to our guide, it is a strong guide. It's an emerging market. We clearly feel good about this long-term opportunity in being over $1 billion, but sometimes in the emerging market, it's a little challenging to get the timing exactly right, but yes, that's \u2013 those are the points to the degree you kind of hit on.","Chris Caso","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from of CJ Muse of Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","CJ Muse","Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, one of the key questions out there is the ability for your wireless business to grow into fiscal 2021. So, I guess, now that you've pulled Huawei 100% out of the numbers and you're guiding WWG flat, what are the core assumptions that we need to kind of assume into fiscal 2021 to have the confidence on that growth, both in terms of, I guess, ASIC replacement on the base band processor, as well as rising content [indiscernible]? Thank you.","Victor Peng","Yes, CJ. So, let me say that. First of all, just to reiterate, what you said is that, we \u2013 for the remainder of FY 2020, I think we delist everything that we're aware of, right? I don't want to give any specific for FY 2021, but just the broader picture. Our view has not changed from the Analyst Days. 5G is definitely going to be a bigger deployment overall. It's a bigger opportunity for us, because we're not just doing the same old thing.","We're innovating delivering more value to our customers with things like RFSoC, with things like Versal. So, we still feel good about that. Obviously, the big variants from that day \u2013 and Analyst Day has been the whole trade situation, but I guess, what I would say is that, we're still in early innings on deployment.","So, as those other innings come through, and as some of the things that trials the things, we have at RFSoC go into production and we get wins in Versal and so forth and even the wins we have in MPSoC. We still think this is a strong opportunity. And, of course, we'll give you the FY 2021 in the usual timeframe right after this fiscal year.","CJ Muse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. Thanks for all the color on segments in the fiscal year, and Lorenzo, best of luck with your next move. So, Victor, I want to ask question on the core vertical market side of things. It doesn't get as much attention, but still significant part of your business obviously.","Overall, I just want to see what gives you the confidence in the flat \u2013 in the fiscal third quarter outlook sequentially and then up in fiscal fourth quarter and we can contrast that against PI last night who I think surprised the vast majority of us with the weakness that they alluded to at least in the December quarter? So, what gives you the confidence in being so much better than that broad base guy or broad base peers, in general, for both of those quarters?","Victor Peng","Yes. I guess, again, I really can't speak for others. I guess, what I would say is that, we do see softness in macroeconomic-related. And some of that is probably also somewhat related to the whole trade situation. We kind of expressed, I think, we expect even in Q1 that we have a, we call it, I think, I referred to it as a product transition or the key TME customer, giving a little more color that, that ramp is happening, but it's going to happen a little bit more spread out.","So, that's an example in the analyst prototyping of one instance. Our channel definitely has stopped especially in Europe, also in Asia in auto, a little pause. But on the other hand, like, let's take auto, for instance. Like, ADAS is where we play, as you know. And even though near-term, auto units are down, what we're hearing from different signals that in 2020 \u2013 calendar 2020, right, that is going to strengthen. And so, we see that and we still have already shipping units that will just continue to ramp in ADAS, as well as being designed into fully autonomous driving.","So, I guess, what it is, is the confidence that we actually see the dip in Q3, but we are seeing from multiple markets. So, it's kind of broad. It's \u2013 I won't say that, it's just one market. It is broad that we're seeing it coming back in Q4. And so \u2013 and then a few key things where we\u2019re very confident just because of \u2013 we know those programs very, very well.","Ross Seymore","Thank you.","Victor Peng","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Matt Ramsay","Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Victor, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the guide for the December quarter. Just a couple of moving parts. I know you guys, I think, called out in the commentary $50 million to Huawei in the first-half of the year. I would assume that most of that was during the first quarter. So, if we could understand a little bit about the sequential difference between Q2 and Q3 guide there and similar for the Solarflare revenue coming into the model, I guess, this will be a full quarter in December. Just trying to understand those moving parts? Thanks.","Victor Peng","Yes. I know this is a pretty packed, pre-prepared statements, because we did want to give a lot of color. So, just to reiterate, yes, you're exactly spot on. With Huawei, the $50 million was predominantly in Q1 prior to the restrictions going in place. Last quarter, we had determined that even with the restrictions, there's some older products that we could legally continue to ship. It turns out that revenue was very essentially negligible, which is why after one quarter of seeing that and not seeing any additional license approvals, we have decided that it's just proven to take all the risk out there means in fiscal year.","With regard to Solarflare, that closed \u2013 that only closed in July. So, you\u2019re right, it's only the first full quarter of revenue in the December quarter and it's what we expect, okay, $10 million, on the order of 10 million-ish, you know but we did the acquisition from a strategic perspective of \u2013 they really bring the software and driver expertise and overall system expertise, complementing our strength in silicon in the hardware. And so, we're feeling very good about the integration and the engagements we have in front of that. The revenue is also what we expect. But I think really more important, the strategic thesis now that they're part of us, we feel even better about.","Lorenzo Flores","Yes, Matt, I just point out one thing. As we plan to consolidate, obviously, those results and not break those out in future calls, but that just gives you a sense for Victor's comments around what we expect from rank on [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong of Instinet. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Can you clarify what you have applied for licenses for? Does this cover all of the revenues that you were previously shipping to Huawei, or if not approximately, what percent of prior revenues to Huawei, to your current license applications cover?","Victor Peng","It's actually very detail, so I wouldn't want to give you, I don\u2019t think it's appropriate to try and breakdown exactly. I would say it would be, if Huawei had applied for in early July, all got approved, it would be meaningful. I wouldn't necessarily say the entirety, but it would be meaningful. And clearly, if that happen, we would continue to try and seek licenses. But unfortunately, like nothing has been approved. And, as they said, the small set of mostly older products, it hasn't had any kind of meaningful revenue, so we've just decided to de-risk it.","David Wong","Great, thanks.","Victor Peng","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you. You said that the bass band to ASIC transitional impact is kind of winds down by the fourth quarter of your fiscal year. Is that \u2013 can you give us a sense for the wireless business that's \u2013 that remains how much bass band is still in there from other customers? Any transitional risk? And just, I assume that the radio deployments are sort of start \u2013 starting to ramp up as we move beyond that, is that a fair way to look at it?","Victor Peng","Yes. I mean, we still have meaningful wireless business, but yes, the base band ASICs, which we had said, even on Analyst Day that we expect that was going to happen, that has happened. We do still have some position, but I don't think it's very significant at this point in base band.","I think we've always said that even ASIC replacement, as you know, Joe is not new to us. We've always said that our opportunities is bigger in the radio, but even in the future that we expect some degree of base band revenue, but we had an outsized amount earlier, and I think we're upfront about that.","But again, I would sort of say that, we \u2013 it is significant that it'd be radio, but we still do base band connectivity. Like, again, that's historically been the thing, where we were in the heart of the overall base band in the start of this early deployment.","Joe Moore","Yes. Okay, got it. Thank you very much.","Victor Peng","Does that help? Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from William Stein of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. If we get some resolution to the tariff situation, but we still have a ban on Huawei going forward. Victor, I wonder if you could comment on expectation for relative to the longer-term growth you outlined at the Analyst Day, not what it\u2019s going to do next year. But you talked about the Sam [ph] growth of, I think, 35% in DCG and I think 16% in wired and wireless. Are those still realistic as share would shift to other customers of yours, or do you think it would call those growth estimates and question?","Victor Peng","Well, first of all, regarding tariffs. Every time those things have occurred, we've analyzed those things and the tariffs don't directly impact us in anyway. There could be like secondary, tertiary, things of just being a damper on macroeconomics. But it doesn't impact us in a dark way.","So, there was some relief there, but the restrictions on Huawei stayed intact for a long period of time, that would be the bigger thing than tariffs by far, which is why I think I've been consistent in saying that, we really hope that the governments can come to an agreement and resolve the structural issues. So, we can continue to engage with Huawei.","Now that said, we're still just, again, I want to say that we're still participating in the China 5G. But clearly, they're a very big player there. And I don't want to speculate on what happens in the long-term, right? It's just too difficult. And we certainly look at different scenarios internally. So, we're prepared for things, but it's really clearly premature to speculate beyond FY 2020.","William Stein","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Quinn Bolton of Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Quinn Bolton","Hi, Victor, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on where you saw the weakness in the wired business and what drives the recovery as we get into the fourth quarter. Is the weakness mostly the Huawei effect, or is it broader than just that one customer?","Victor Peng","Well, it's \u2013 that was definitely an impact, because people tend to think of Huawei is just purely wise, but actually they play in both places. And so, they're pretty substantial there. But it's not just a one customer. I think there has been some bonus in access in cable.","I think that there's a particular situation, where things \u2013 people initially started to deploy than they took a more cautious approach, because, of course, with 5G, it\u2019s both wireless and then ultimately the wired network has to be upgraded as well. And I think with all this uncertainty, there has been, as I said in my prepared remarks, some caution around that. So, Huawei is definitely a big deal, but it is not the only thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess, I'm struggling a little bit with the March \u2013 implied March guidance. Obviously, WWG is down. It suggests substantial growth in the two other segments to get anywhere near the sequential and it\u2019d be record revenue across the board for all the segment. So, I think I'm doing the math right. I guess, I'm just trying to understand in this environment, why you'd be doing record revenue with this substantial double-digit increases into March?","Victor Peng","Well, datacenter, as I said, we hit the midpoint of guide. It will be about a 30% year-on-year increase, and obviously, the first-half is a little softer. So, DCG is definitely robustly growing in the second-half, right? I mean, now Q2 was a record, so Q3 is coming off of that a little bit, but that was a record. But then we said that we've resumed sequential strength in DCG in Q4. So, overall, DCG is growing very strong. And yes, it'll be a record.","In some of the other markets, I think, we \u2013 I think we had said that TME had earlier because of some product transitions that that was slowing down. And also, earlier semi is a little weak. So, in terms of semiconductor test, it was a variety of different things. But we had already expected that in the second-half things would strengthen. It's still going to strengthen, maybe a little more moderated than we had expected back in the spring, for sure, because of some of the macro \u2013 some of the other issues, but that's still happening.","And, as we said, auto, people are starting to see, ADAS is still growing, auto is still going to pick up. It'll be double-digit. So, it's actually in Q4 kind of broad. Q3 is just \u2013 it really is kind of a perfect storm of a bunch of things some expected, some unexpected happening all at once. So, you have this big contrast there. But yes, that's how we see it right now.","Blayne Curtis","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question, and thank you and good luck to Lorenzo on his next adventure.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you, Vivek.","Vivek Arya","Victor, could you \u2013 Thank you. Yes, so maybe, Victor, if you could help us differentiate your position in the radio side. I think, you mentioned that you expect to have a resilient business in the radio side. What is unique to an FPGA in the radio that cannot be done with an ASIC? I assume that some of your customers already used some ASICs in the radio side in China and other places. So, why \u2013 what gives you the confidence that they cannot be ASIC replacement on the radio side at some point?","Victor Peng","Well, again, first of all, what I would say is, if you look at our MPSoC and absolutely our RFSoC, those aren\u2019t just pure FPGAs, right? So, I will \u2013 I really want to go back to those have multi core SOCs in them, they have a lot \u2013 a number of other features that are hardened and yet still flexible and programmable. And, of course, the RFSoC has integrated RF quality ADCs and DAC. There are no products in the marketplace even today after we've released this for quite some time out there.","So, what we could do is, we could be used in different geographies, support different standards with the same piece of silicon. Obviously, we get people to market very rapidly. And there's just optimizations particularly and the trend to overran and where things virtualization. That's the disruption in an opportunity. And we definitely see that in the long range, that's a big thing.","Then I could say, as we announced, ACAP a year ago, now we've delivered silicon and we're shipping that. We have development boards, that way not in FPGA, right? That's a whole new class of product. And absolutely, that's \u2013 I've said that we feel like we have an even stronger position versus pics \u2013 architectures. And if you heard about XCF in my prepared comments, it sounds someone was on the stage talking about how we're collaborating, looking at how ACAP continue to update their 5G roadmap, so\u2026","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Victor Peng","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Christopher Rolland","Hey, Victor. So, for WWG, where do you see your biggest opportunity in the next 18 months coming from? Is it really the European guys at this point? And then I think you also mentioned some customer delays. So, any thoughts on timing of resolution and relaunching those products? Thanks.","Victor Peng","Yes, gosh, I mean, I \u2013 18 months is pretty far out. I sort of feel that, that's not something we can give guidance on at this point in time. We clearly have de-risked everything that we've seen for the remainder of this fiscal year. We are in the early stages of deployment. So, I would generalize what your comment to say, clearly, there\u2019s going to be several generations, as well as geographical deployments.","Right now, it's South Korea and China, a little bit in Japan, but not very meaningful. So clearly, there will be other geographies that deploy and there'll be multiple generations of 5G equipment. So, we're engaged with all the OEMs worldwide, right, not just Samsung and Chinese only on this, but also the European. So, we're engaging in all of them. And so, yes, as these things deploy, we still feel again from a strategic perspective that opportunity is still great. Obviously, trade, we will have to see.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Thank you for allowing me back in. Before I forget, I would be really miss, if I didn't say thank you to Lorenzo and wish you all the best, that\u2019s a pleasure working with you. Thanks for all the transparency and help as a CFO of Xilinx. I had a question, I wanted to come back to the datacenter side, Victor, and maybe this would be a good time for us from our side to get a little bit recalibrated with how you think the longer-term opportunities are, so compute, network and storage. And if you look out longer-term, which of those three are going to be the big drivers to get to the long-term targets you had given? And I had a quick one on datacenter as well. I think I heard you mention that one of the reasons gross margin was weaker was because of datacenter mix, did they [indiscernible]. Does that imply that datacenter will be dilutive to gross margin? Thank you.","Victor Peng","Okay. So, let me\u2026","Lorenzo Flores","[Multiple Speakers] first part.","Victor Peng","Yes, I'll take the first part and then Lorenzo will work at that the remainder of this call here. Yes, look, the first part, I think, all three sub-segments are going to be meaningful drivers. I mean, they are obviously different in nature. I mean, overall, in the very long run, compute is still the largest segment.","It's also in some respects, it is a long game, because that's the place where we really \u2013 we announced Vitis, we announced open source, where we're doing a lot of things to sort of give users that traditionally have not used our platform, feel comfortable and work in their own environment, like the machine \u2013 the artificial intelligence machine learning framework, like TensorFlow and so forth, right?","So, that in the long run is the biggest opportunity, but it's also going to take time, because that's where ecosystem and all those tools and so on so forth can play a big role. But both SmartSSD and SmartNIC, whereas they may not be so large and long, they're also still quite meaningful. And there, we don't have those issues, right? We're engaged with multiple hyper scalars. We also had some OEM engagements. And we have \u2013 we've been setting up our channels by bars and size and so forth. And so, we see some really good opportunities there.","So, again, it depends on your timeframe, which is going to be big contributors. We see contributions from all of them, quite frankly. And yes, we're really excited. But in full candor, we've learned that, it takes some time to get these POCs done, it takes some time to get all the requirements [Audio Gap], but now that we have those learnings. We're still going. We're going to go out there robustly.","Lorenzo Flores","Yes. So, on the margin piece, I think, I'll start with the end of your question, which is do you expect growth in datacenter or long-term to have a negative impact on a gross margin. I think the dynamic with datacenter over the long-term will be similar to some of our other larger segments, where we have large customers with relatively lower margins as would be expected and broad set of customers with relatively higher margins. And the overall impact on the mix, as we expect it today, is relatively neutral and close to our corporate average.","In the short-term, the exact opposite thing is happening, where we had customer concentration and \u2013 which is actually a good thing in this case, because it showed very strong customer growth. And it wasn't that the net result was significantly off of corporate gross margin, it was just that it was lower than our expectations. So, that's why it pulled us down versus our forecast.","Christopher Rolland","Maybe because of storage being a bigger driver that led to lower gross margin?","Lorenzo Flores","That's a good hypothesis.","Christopher Rolland","Thank you.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin.","Matt Poirier","Thank you, Erica, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, the business outlook for the December quarter and the revised outlook for fiscal year 2019. We will then open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","As we discussed in last quarter\u2019s earnings call, in addition to GAAP financial measures, we will also be disclosing certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial results. We provide these measures to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operations, by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions.","We believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Victor.","Victor Peng","Thanks, Matt and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very excited to report that executing on our new strategy is returning results in FY19 that are well ahead of our original plan. We have broad strength in our business in Q2 with growth in six out of nine of our end markets. Establishing ourselves in the data center and accelerating growth in our core markets resulted in a new quarterly revenue record of 746 million, which is up 19% year-over-year and drove the non-GAAP EPS, up 30% year-over-year.","Given our first half FY19 results and the continued near term strength we see in multiple markets, we're raising our guidance for all of FY19 to be between $2.95 billion to $3 billion. Now to be clear, we are watching the macro environment very carefully. Nonetheless, we feel this is the appropriate forward guidance.","So let me share some recent business highlights. So, communications was very strong in Q2, driven by LTE upgrades, pre-5G and some early 5G deployments. Our wireless business grew very significantly with broad based strength in both radio and baseband applications with major OEMs across multiple geographies and we resumed shipping to ZTE. Our wired business grew due to customer transitions to next generation product in several applications, including OTN Metro, access and data center interconnect.","In the data center segment, we continue to build momentum with hyperscale companies and acceleration deployment. So for example, Twitch, a subsidiary of Amazon, shared at our Developer\u2019s Forum how they achieved the industry\u2019s first broadcast quality live streaming platform using a new video and coding format, VV9 and all accelerated on our FPGAs.","Samsung announced at their Tech Day their smart SSD product, which was the result of a year-long collaboration between our companies. Samsung\u2019s smart SSD combines our 60-nanometer ultrascale plus FPGA with their leadership storage technology for accelerating computing near the store data. With regard to FAS, our leadership position in China market expanded, as Alibaba changed their FPGA as a service from beta access to general access. And this falls on Huawei\u2019s general access that occurred with their FAS program this past June.","And recently, Amazon Web Services doubled their FAS availability zones four 4 to 8, adding London, Sydney, Frankfurt, and most recently China.","Now continuing in terms of data center in our platforms, earlier this month, we announced Alveo, a portfolio of very powerful adaptable accelerated cards that will increase the performance in industry standard servers, both in the cloud and in our on-prem data centers, a very broad range of applications including AI inference. And Alveo did ship for revenue very late in Q2, but the revenue ramp really begins in the second half of FY19. We expect revenue to grow at a good pace, but in absolute terms, will be relatively modest for FY19. We do expect Alveo to contribute meaningful revenue in FY20.","Now, we also made excellent progress in our data center partnerships and ecosystem. So, working with AMD, we achieved an industry record for the highest AI inference throughput performance at 30,000 images per second, with less than 2 milliseconds latency, all packed in a 4U server form factor with epic CPUs and 8 Alveo accelerator cards. Huawei has announced that they are integrating and deploying Alveo acceleration cards in their server and product portfolio and we are collaborating together to foster an applications ecosystem in China.","Inspur, a leading global data center and cloud computing solutions provider announced that they'll be qualifying to Alveo cards together with their server platforms. And on the investment side, we made multiple investments last quarter in applications ecosystems, both in the data center as well as in other markets for a breadth of applications, including database acceleration, mobility and next generation technology.","And with respect to acquisitions, we did complete our acquisition of DeePhi Tech, which is an AI Technology Company and integration is going quite well. Their products and technology significantly strengthens our AI capabilities and what we can offer for use cases in the cloud at the edge and at endpoints.","Now moving on to our progress overall as a platform company, our 28 and 60-nanometer Zync product families continue to grow very robustly. Zync sales achieved a new record, growing 70% from a year ago quarter and that represents 18% of sales. Growth was across a broad set of applications in the communications, automotive, mostly advanced driver assist systems and industrial end markets.","Our Zync RFSoC products had a revenue growth for approximately 4x versus the prior quarter\u2019s revenue and we have well over 100 unique customers at various stages of engagement and we see our opportunity pipeline growing in double digit percentages. And finally, the most profound recent milestone by far was our official announcement of our 7-nanometer Versal product family, the NC\u2019s first ACAP. ACAP to refresh your memory stands for adaptive compute acceleration platform and this is a new product category that goes far beyond the capabilities of FPGAs. ACAPs are adaptable, scalable and are heterogeneous compute platforms that is both hardware as well as software programmable.","So the Versal family will accelerate a very broad range of applications, including AI inference and applications that have embedded AI in them across multiple end markets and from use cases that span the cloud to the edge and endpoints and indeed communications infrastructure that connects them. Versal delivers effectively the power of full custom silicon without the high cost and very long development cycles of silicon. And they could be optimized to accelerate applications on the fly and actual running systems. So we're on track to tape out the first 7-nanometer Versal product at TSMC later this quarter and we hope silicon next year.","So in closing, I'm extremely proud of our team\u2019s excellence and innovation and consistent execution. I'm excited to see the fruits of our efforts in our Q2 and our expectations for the full fiscal year. We continue to be deeply focused on executing our strategy for sustained, robust long term revenue growth and shareholder value.","So thank you and now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo Flores","Great. Thank you, Victor and good afternoon, everybody. As Victor said, we are very pleased with our business performance this quarter and our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year. Xilinx established several financial records and we are again in the fortunate position of increasing our guidance for FY19. I will elaborate on that guidance after reviewing the quarter.","Now for Q2. Revenue was at an all-time high of $746 million, growing 9% from last quarter and 19% year-over-year. We exceeded the high end of our guidance on the strength of our advanced products, which grew 25% over last quarter and 43% year-over-year. Victor pointed out the strength of Zync. It grew 70% year-on-year and highlights our progress as a platform company.","From an end market perspective, we saw strengths from three of our four primary end markets. Data center and TME grew significantly with both businesses contributing to the increase in sales. In communications, wired grew more than expected and wireless was particularly strong. Automotive, broadcasting consumer was stronger than expected as automotive and broadcast growth more than offset a slight decline in consumer. ","Industrial and A&D declined as expected with a decrease mostly in A&D. Finally, channel revenue was in line with expectations at 19 million. Note, we remain below target levels of channel inventory.","Gross margin was 69%, slightly below our guidance, due to the strength of wireless and lower A&D in our end market mix. GAAP operating expense was 282 million and non-GAAP operating expense was 279 million, both in line with our guidance. GAAP operating income was $233 million or 31.2% and non-GAAP operating income was $236 million or 31.6%.","Our tax rate was 10% for the quarter. Our non-GAAP rate was 6%. The primary difference between these rates consist of discrete items related to tax reform. Our GAAP net income was $216 million, equating to $0.84 a share of earnings. Non-GAAP net income was $221 million or $0.87 of earnings per share. This is a record level of earnings for Xilinx.","Diluted shares for the quarter were flat at 256 million shares. There are a few key points on the balance sheet and cash flow I would like to highlight. We ended the quarter with 3.4 billion in gross cash, down slightly quarter-on-quarter and 1.7 billion in net debt. We generated operating cash flow of $313 million, due in part to reducing accounts receivable to $372 million, approximately 45 days.","On capital allocation, we returned 114 million to shareholders with $91 million in dividends and $23 million in share repurchase at an average price of $66.08 a share. As Victor discussed, we completed the acquisition of DeePhi in the quarter. This acquisition, intended to accelerate our strategy, the dividend and our buyback, reflects the application of our capital allocation strategy as discussed at our Analyst Day.","On to Q3 and our updated FY19 guidance. We expect revenue to continue to grow with Q3 between $760 million and $780 million. We are forecasting growth in communications, data center and TME and industrial and aerospace and defense. Particular strength is expected in aerospace and defense, wireless and TME. Automotive broadcast and consumer looks to come in approximately flat. Channel revenue is expected to be between $10 million and $20 million.","In Q3, our gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% and GAAP operating expense in the range of $295 million. We expect non-GAAP operating expense to be approximately $290 million. The increase quarter-to-quarter in operating expense is related to increases in employee compensation, including profit sharing and sales incentive and the full integration of the DeePhi acquisition.","Other income will be approximately $5 million and our tax rate is expected to be between 10% and 12%. For the full year FY19 forecast, we are now expecting our revenue to be between $2.950 billion and $3 billion. At the midpoint, this would be 20% year-over-year revenue growth. Gross margin for the year is expected to be between 69% and 70%. GAAP operating expense for the year is expected to be approximately $1.155 billion and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be approximately $1.140 million.","GAAP other income for the year will be approximately $15 million of income and non-GAAP other income will be approximately $5 million of income. Our GAAP tax rate for the year is expected to be between 10% and 12% and the non-GAAP rate between 9% and 11%. Share count is expected to be flat to very slightly up for the rest of the year. ","In summary, we expect the year to show exceptional growth in revenue and profits. We are at the initial stages of realizing the benefits of our strategy and execution and we are excited to see our opportunities developing ahead of our expectations.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from [indiscernible] from Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","This is [indiscernible]. Thanks for taking my question. My question relates to your commerce business. Just can you talk about any geographic concentration you have there, more specifically, can you quantify your exposure to the China market and talk about the growth, excluding China and should we expect this to be the new baseline for the communications business, how sustainable are these trends as you move into 2019? Thanks.","Victor Peng","Well, China is an important market, but as I said in my comments that we saw growth actually with all the top customers in that segment worldwide. So I would say that we're seeing growth in a number of areas, although China is important. I think we have mentioned in \u2013 on the forums that in any event, one of the areas where there's maybe an acceleration of 5G deployments happening in Korea actually. So again while China is important, we're seeing growth actually in multiple geographies. We have consistently, in the past, said that we expected the really large ramp to happen 2020. It does appear that it\u2019s happening -- it's starting a bit earlier. We still believe that it will continue to build and carry over indeed of course past 2020, but it does appear that it's happening a bit earlier. So I think from that perspective, that's a new recent trend I suppose.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore","You talked about the growth in Zync. That was pretty impressive growth there. How do you see it? Are you expanding the TAM or these sockets that you might not have had, had you not had Zync integration and what's your visibility on continuing this very strong ramp that you've seen in Zync?","Victor Peng","Yeah. Joe, I mean, I think Zync is -- it is very broad based, which is what's so exciting about it, right? As you know, it\u2019s something that we pioneered quite some time ago and I would say that in the early days, it took a little bit longer and the thing that we gain from that was that there was more software work and things that took a while, but now what we're seeing is just we're just seeing very broad strength everywhere and certainly we do think that we are taking away from other types of solutions, right. ","Other ASSPs, other embedded controllers and certainly some -- we were on that board before with an FPGA perhaps, but now we\u2019re capturing more of that and MPS will see the second generation and the RFSoC is based on that, added to it the really high performance integrated ADCs and DACs. So, we are expanding I would say the footprint of Zync as well as the fact that the investment we made back in 28-nanometers. Indeed, most of the revenue is still 28-nanometer Zync. We're seeing a tremendous uptake in terms of design-ins on the 16-nanometer, but most of the revenue for that is still in front us.","Joe Moore","And I guess I\u2019m out with several of your customers at your developers forum and we kind of heard about the use of Zync and about, specifically we heard the comment that if Xilinx had more libraries, then we\u2019d be able to use I think some more applications. How do you think about that from an investment standpoint? How do you balance? It seems like there is a fairly direct tie to developing sort of more of the Xilinx generated IP and revenue, but it obviously takes a lot. So how do you balance that in this growth environment? Should we expect R&D to maybe continue to move up, as you look at those opportunities?","Victor Peng","It's a very good point and again we're really trying to work that balance of continuing to invest. We can keep on this very strong growth, but also return to the investors. And so you will see some growth and on a percentage basis, we're increasing our headcount in software and IP and things above the silicon level if you will much more. Having said that, we're also putting a big focus, that's why you hear me in the highlights and I think hopefully you took away from our developer\u2019s forum that we're really trying driving ecosystem. So it\u2019s not just the Xilinx R&D budget, but it's the collective budget of the ecosystem as well as partners like AND, like Samsung and others. So it\u2019s an and of all those things, we're going to try and do all those things. But, it is part of our balance on how we deliver returns as well as continue to invest, so that we can get higher leverage and more leverage in the model.","Operator","Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess first question, as it relates to wireless and early 5G deployment, can you speak to, I guess, whether this is just prototyping today or other and then importantly, what you've learned now on a content basis and how that translates into sustained growth into 2020 and beyond?","Victor Peng","Yes. So the first part of it, it's, what we're now seeing is not prototyping. I mean, I think we've been saying for some quarters that we're inversely on the early proof of concepts and prototyping. So now, what you're sort of seeing is some of that going into production and I would say and then you heard me make the comment of radio and baseband. So, we do have more content than we have had traditionally. RFSoC is another element and that is actually still emerging and in terms of what we\u2019ll see there and that is absolutely production. It is most cost effective, power efficient and size weight form factor based solution out there. No one really has the product like RFSoC. So, yeah, it's pretty strong.","Sorry, second part of the question regarding.","C.J. Muse","What you\u2019re looking from the early deployments today as to what the revenue contributions can look like, as we go into as deployment?","Victor Peng","Yeah. I mean, we continue to see wireless for the year ending up very strong. And although we still expect that things will be [indiscernible] at times or overall, 5G will be the largest deployment I think the industry has seen. And so, we're extremely well positioned for that. I mean, again, I think particularly with RFSoC, I think on the radio, we have an extremely strong position. Yeah. So I do think that this will build, but again no doubt there'll still be some lumpiness, right, as we go through.","C.J. Muse","Great. I guess as a follow-up here, at your Developer\u2019s Forum, and you launched Versal. I think one of the key questions was software to follow up on Joe's question, so curious how we should be thinking about key milestones there in terms of developer\u2019s training instances, what should we be focused on?","Victor Peng","Yeah. We're trying to share each of those elements, right. I mean, as you just said, expansion of FAS, but also non-FAS. It\u2019s certainly not all about that. Indeed, there tends to be a little bit of focus of us just in data center compute, but the Samsung SSD product, I mean, we accelerate in storage. We also have positions in smart mix and converse mix. I think there is a very strong trend in the networking side of the business. There's the ecosystem and then our board business, right, which I think we gave a little bit of the foreshadowing, all the way back to our Analyst Day and we would execute that. So I think watch to see how many people are developing and offering that board and as those board \u2013 that board business more meaningfully contributes to revenue in next fiscal year, that will be another sign of things. ","On investment level, if we can keep up this great growth, we're going to return some to shareholders and we're going to reinvest to keep this firewall spinning.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Victor, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more, in your prepared comments, you said that you have your eye on the macro and if I look at the businesses that are probably most macro influence for you, it\u2019s industrial and A&D. And yet despite kind of a macro backdrop that we\u2019re all worried about, you\u2019re guiding pretty strong growth for the December quarter. Curious if you could kind of square that circle for me and as you answer the question, maybe talk about what might be share gains that you're picking up in those end markets?","Victor Peng","Yeah well. A&D actually was down already in the current quarter, but that was off a very strong quarter and we actually believe that going forward, that\u2019s going to strengthen up again. So we actually don't see any signs in the A&D area for sensitive to that. I'll give you one where we do as a sub-segment of our overall basket. As you know, our baskets are pretty big, right, so test measure and emulation and prototyping. Within that, there are semiconductor tests and we are seeing weakening as you might expect within that.","On the other hand, emulation and prototyping, we're seeing great strength. So given all of those puts and takes, we\u2019re still seeing TME is on track for an excellent year. So, and also within test, there's also a very special, just as including like 5G test equipment and we\u2019re seeing good strength there for obvious reasons. So, I think this is -- part of this is the strength of the diversity that we have and also the high value and innovation that we have that we're less sensitive than to other products that are \u2013 perhaps, there are more options available for people just to switch in and out or it\u2019s just not as high value or not in the core to system, right.","So I think that's one aspect of it. And again, we walked into this quarter with very strong backlog. I mean, we feel good about the guidance and then of course FY20, we give that in the Analyst Day and we certainly will earn a lot between now and then, but again, we\u2019ve looked at it and certainly, we're very keenly aware of the environment, we're just seeing good signals for our business.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. The other follow-up, just relative to. Go ahead, Lorenzo.","Lorenzo Flores","No. I think if you were -- I wasn't sure John whether you\u2019re referring to the overall growth that we're expecting quarter-on-quarter or just an industrial and A&D. One of the pieces we didn't talk about is continuing strength in communications, particularly in wireless. We think that aligns with both the 4G, LTE continued fill out and the growth in 5G. So that's the last piece of the overall growth story. And then, I'm sorry, go ahead.","John Pitzer","And then I guess, Victor, as a follow-up, I was intrigued by your comments about growth in datacenter in FY20. Your confidence level seems pretty high. Seems like you\u2019ve got a good line of sight. I know, there is probably a lot you can't talk about, but I wanted to give you the opportunity to elaborate on that comment and what gives you that confidence, is this new customers, is this silicon to board. Maybe if you can help us just kind of parse that out.","Victor Peng","Yeah. Well, it's actually a blend, as I said. We actually did get some revenue at the very end of Q2 for Alveo boards and by the way, we only have one board, well actually, we have two boards, the U200 and U250. But we are going to launch more boards through the course of the next short number of quarters. And, I said that they don't grow at a good rate, but it's starting from a very small number. So it's not meaningful, but FY20 will be meaningful. So if you step back, I mean, we didn't have a board\u2019s revenue stream at all, right. So that certainly is contributing to that. ","The other thing is there's a lot of games that I can't really speak to right now, but I did get -- I am able to say, so I mentioned Samsung\u2019s smart SSD, they launched that. I can tell you that we have a design win to do a smart memory DIM with a very major memory supplier, but I cannot say who. So, and then, as you know, a lot of the customers, for competitive reasons, I think it\u2019s close to the chest, but we do feel that next fiscal year, we will start seeing much more meaningful revenue. We've been saying that we\u2019re seeing good percentage growth of a relatively smaller number and datacenter as a segment, but in next fiscal year, particularly in the back half, we really see that it's going to start coming together.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","I just wanted to make sure I understood the confidence for the full year. Victor, is it and Lorenzo, is it dependent on comps, 5G, 4G as well as LVO beginning to kick in and what about the other segments, so I'm talking beyond the quarter that you're guiding for?","Victor Peng","Let me give a briefing and I\u2019ll let Lorenzo add colors to this as well. I mean, I think, one of the reasons and I mentioned also while we're very dialed in to watching the macro situation, we still feel that the appropriate guide is because of the breath of the strength that we saw in Q2, which is carrying over into this quarter and also from what we can see for the fourth. So, and clearly as the first half came in stronger than our initial expectations for the year, so I would say, it's the breadth, yes, so that means generalizing your statement, you just pointed out communication and then data center boards, but it goes beyond that, because we're seeing strength in all the other markets, even though within some of those markets, there are weaknesses. As I said, TME, there are weaknesses in some of the segments within that bucket, but the overall larger end market that we report out looks really good for the year.","Lorenzo Flores","I don't have much to add. I mean just it\u2019s kind of obvious, given the relative size of the end markets and the dynamic that we talked about, with the growth in communications, that continues -- that is a large dollar contributor, but it is much more broad than that in the portfolio of end markets we support. ","Ambrish Srivastava","And then within communications, if I remember the number correctly, you said it was up 35% year-over-year, but if we go back, could you give us a sense for -- it has to be well below the peak level we saw a few years ago. So how far below are we from that level and now you have more content, so we should expect as we get into the broader 5G rollout, six or eight quarters from now, that number should be higher than what you did in the last build? Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","Give me just one second to make sure I'm not misaligning things. It is still, from both of the end markets in communications, it is still meaningfully below the highs we've seen, for both wired and wireless in the past, three and five years ago. But I think also, the other thing to think about it, given the growth of our other end markets, it's a smaller percentage of our overall business. Our overall exposure to that is smaller, but we do expect that we have headroom, as we\u2019ve discussed in both wired and wireless to get past the historic levels at some point in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","Victor, obviously, there is quite a bit of concern around end markets, like industrials, automotive, semi test, as you sort of addressed them. Can you give us an idea, what\u2019s sort of embedded in your back half guide for some of these end markets where we do have concerns?","Victor Peng","Well, I think I talked a bit about the TME, right. Yes, there are some weakness in some areas, but then some areas are up. So again, from what we can see, we think that for the year, TME will be up quite nicely overall and certainly in the first half, everything is strong, right, including semi \u2013 semiconductor test. On automotive, we're seeing growth and we do still expect it to continue, but just to put that in context, I think we sort of talked about how automotive is sort of in the around \u2013 about 7% of our business. ","So, I mean, even if there's some fluctuation on that, just to put that in context, right, so I would say again, yes, we watch it very carefully in some segments that will feel it, but because just not to be repetitive, but since we have such broad strength in some of these areas we know the dynamics are such that they won't be affected like, since the operators decided they want to pull in 5G, they are not going to back off. Now, they may modulate, right, the ramp, but since we have always said that we really were planning more of a ramp in the later timeframe to some extent, just the fact that accelerated has been upside, right and then RFSoC, which we've never had before, that continues. ","We would have liked three more wars just this last quarter, because this is still the product like that. And so, we will have more value in the radio side and there is more radio that\u2019s going to be deployed. So, yes, there are some areas that are weaker, but again because of the broad strength and some of the leadership product that we have, I don't think we're going to be as affected, but of course we\u2019re going to watch this very carefully.","Lorenzo Flores","Yeah. We're in a good position obviously in areas like wireless and even in auto, where the platforms that we've been designed into with our products, our high value products are tending to be in the ramp phase. So while macro factors may impact it, they're still in some ways gaining share versus alternatives in multiple end markets, but it puts us in a pretty good position.","Toshiya Hari","Great. And then as a quick follow up, Victor, obviously, you've been on the road quite a bit hosting a lot of sessions and I'm sure you've had a conversation with customers, but for Alveo specifically, what's been the feedback so far. You talked about the ramp into December and more so into calendar \u201919, how should we think about the magnitude of that ramp again for Alveo specifically?","Victor Peng","Yes. For FY19, again, it\u2019s starting from effectively zero, right, just at the very end of last quarter. So, it will grow on a percentage basis, but we're not saying that to be very material. But through the course of FY20, as I said in my comments, it will be meaningful revenue. I think the interest is high. I do think that how much more upside versus it maybe being a little bit moderate, there is certainly a degree of around some of the things that the early questions around application development, in fact also just education and so forth and that's why we did the Developer\u2019s Forum and hopefully you saw some of the momentum that we are getting in strong interest there, right. So it's early days, but we do feel like the signals are, there's a lot of interest and revenue being meaningful in FY20 timeframe, not FY1.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Robert Baird.","Tristan Gerra","You\u2019re now starting to go after semiconductor content that traditionally has been discrete chips, adjacent to FPGA such as DACs and ADCs universal RF series. What are the other content adjacency opportunities that you are seeing and can you talk about the candidate, if any, in addition to that could be play as part of the FPGA integration going forward.","Lorenzo Flores","Yeah. So one is, if you look at Versal, to a degree, the reason why that\u2019s -- we keep trying to make sure people appreciate that it's not an FPGA is exactly because of the richness of the multiple different types of compute engines and all the infrastructure we've built into that. It's got multi-core SOCs, it's got a network on a chip, it's got the next generation programmable adaptive hardware, the fabric and distributed memory and it's got this new, in some of the products, some of the sub families before them, series like for instance the AI core series will have this new architecture, call it, the AI engine. ","And so if you look at just the integration level and part of that of course is still going to have all the multi-MACs, high speeds series, some will talk to integrated HVM on a silicon interposer. It's a really, really complete and powerful platform. So that is exactly the direction that we're going in and so because of that, we can expand and we will expand our SAM and we're increasing more and more the competition isn't just other FPGAs. It\u2019s indeed well beyond that.","And then to get the leverage and there's been a lot of good questions around this area that that's why we're so focused on so in delivering a whole software stack and then driving an ecosystem around that. So yes, we\u2019re integrating a tremendous amount of capability into our Versal products.","Tristan Gerra","And then just going back on the, while the opportunity, even if we assume that the ASPs are half the less price that you\u2019ve mentioned, trying to reconcile this with your targeted, incremental revenue coming from data center suggest that you\u2019re probably making very conservative market share or adoption rate assumptions, any color you could give us in terms of assumption of market share or any type of adoption rate that you see for that new revenue stream to get to your guidance.","Victor Peng","Well, what I would say is that, we -- I wouldn\u2019t say that we're being very conservative, but we're certainly trying to be measured, because it is new for us. But as I said, we are seeing strong interest. It\u2019s just pretty early days. I think we also -- we have to build out, which we are. We're actively building out the whole go to market channels. All of that is being produced, so I would say again that we are going to be priced competitively, but we deliver an awful lot of value and then we will see both share. I mean, the whole acceleration segment is relatively new right, but we do feel like this is a whole new product revenue stream as well as a way to accelerate people getting to market with applications, right, because we don't -- people have to start with a chip, so that's why again, we're pricing the value and we think we\u2019re going to capture that value, but it\u2019s an emerging area.","Operator","Your next question comes from [indiscernible] from KeyBanc Capital.","Unidentified Analyst","I just wanted to follow-up on kind of the data center question that was asked earlier. It seems like you've got very good proof points right now with several of your customers like Huawei, WS, and Baba adapting FAS, but it seems like there's a much more meaningful opportunity, if you can convince one of your customers to move forward with an internal acceleration architecture, similar to what we've seen at Catapult. We think it will take for one of your customers or potential customers to move forward with that use case and is that something that we can think about happening potentially next year, that's potentially baked into your expectations for more meaningful growth in data center?","Victor Peng","Well, look, I mean I agree to that. The world is not just that fast and indeed, like I said, earlier, for us, it\u2019s unlike many other suppliers, it's not even just about data center compute, right, like in storage, just heard, we're working on memory and we're in smart and conversion mix. But now back to your point, I agree and I'm sure you heard in my opening comments that the Twitch group, right, and they did acceleration on video, right. So just goes to show again, we do do that and we are working with others. Again, it's just always a bit challenging in terms of when things can be shared, and but yes, we have many engagements for internal acceleration, some which involve machine learning, some which do not. I think Alveo is going to also help that, because again it lowers the barrier significantly for people to develop applications and also to bring that on-prem. So, it\u2019s not everything that\u2019s around in public cloud, right. So I agree with you and I hope that I can share more of that going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","And then my follow-up is on 5G. It seems like your customers are approaching 5G with a combination of using RFSoC and MPSoC and some other FPGAs, can you just talk about your expectations for 5G. Do you expect the majority of your 5G customers to move to RFSoC and because of the integration and performance in the BOM cost savings, does that give you more staying power late in the cycle as your customers consider kind of ASIC reversion as an opportunity?","Victor Peng","Absolutely. I think I couldn\u2019t have made the same statement better than you just articulate. I mean, look, the RFSoC really is like, it\u2019s not hype. I mean, there's nobody that has a product like that and by the way, it's not just 5G, right. I mean, it's any kind of massive MIMO or antennary application. We see it in cable, we see it in other kinds of like radar applications. And people are changing their architecture, the radio architecture, based on this. And so, in that sense, it\u2019s certainly pretty sticky. ","I don't really see what in that particular instance, people being able to disrupt that and it's just getting started, right. We just recently went into production and people are deploying. So I think RFSoC will certainly be very, very strong. And, but you're right, it was not just RFSoC. We\u2019re seeing usage of other MPSoCs as well as just our FPGAs, at the 16-nanometer node. Some of that over the course of time could go to that, but right now, things are so dynamic and things are moving so quickly. ","That isn't happening and I think that's going to actually \u2013 5G is so ambitious and there's so many things happening that that will probably happen for a bit longer, but I'm not necessarily suggesting that our position in baseband will be as durable as our position in radio, for instance, right. I mean, I think, radio is -- and we already have a roadmap, right. So it's not just the first generation RFSoC. We already have the product, the next generation as well as in 7-nanometer.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Jay for Ross Seymore. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You touched on this previously, but how do you view Xilinx\u2019s benefit from the 5G transition as compared to the 4G transition, perhaps from a magnitude and duration perspective.","Victor Peng","Yeah. I mean to expand on it, I think 5G is going to clearly overtime significantly past what 4G was as the industry and that's for us, it's a bigger opportunity as well and it's both because of the 5G from a technology perspective is so much more disruptive. It's much broader and it really is not just a communication standard, but it's really being used as a term for a basket of technology, including things like massive MIMO, which isn\u2019t inherently necessarily 5G. There is IoT being associated, also automotive. So, it's very broad, very ambitious. And then it's not just because of the segment is bigger, it's also like we're innovative, we added value that we're adding more value like again, in RFSoC for instance. For that matter, MPSoC, but back in the 4G, we didn't have integrated multi-core RFSoCs and we didn't have really high performance ADCs and DACs monolithically integrated. So yes, I think, the general market will be bigger and broader and I think our opportunity over time will be significantly larger.","Unidentified Analyst","As a follow up on the OpEx side, how far along are Xilinx\u2019s software investments in support of the data center efforts, do you expect those investments to slow or do they need to persist on a structural or customer by customer engagement basis?","Victor Peng","Well, I think, in broad strokes, it's certainly not going to slow. I mean we need to, in fact, within what\u2019s reasonable and affordable, so that we could return values to shareholders and still continue to invest. As I said, we\u2019ll probably invest from a headcount perspective fortunately more in software and things about silicon than we would at the silicon level. Having said that, we are investing in the ecosystem and also doing partnerships. So we're really trying to expand the footprint. So it's not just us.","Now, the other part that you alluded to is also true, right, some of the really, really big customers. There's a lot of customization. There's things that we work very closely with to make sure that we deliver to their needs and we are investing and doing that as well for obviously the select top customers.","So yeah for both of those reasons, just the broad horizontal investment as well as some key major customers, we are and we will be investing more on software and IT and related things.","Operator","And your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Just curious into the September quarter, you mentioned ZTE was back, just curious how much that was and maybe versus what you were planning when you guided? And then just longer term, just curious, you talked about earlier 5G. If you can just relate it to the ramp of 4G. That\u2019s all two sharp quarters in the beginning of \u201914 and then kind of fell. It sounds like 5G may be a little longer lived, just kind of curious, as you look out over the next few quarters or even years, the trajectory of 5G versus 4G.","Victor Peng","Okay. So the first part ZTE, so as we said when the first de novo order happened and we just want to remind everybody, we don't have any 10% customers or anyone that\u2019s even near 10% to be honest. Having said that, ZTE is an important customer and so it was a component certainly of our growth, but again, I want to emphasize that that wasn't -- it wasn't just about ZTE. There is early deployments and we\u2019re seeing strength from other major customers are client to wireless.","I would say because, like that occurred just at the very start of fiscal \u201919, I would say that it's not as though we see ZTE being above our original plan. I mean obviously, they had one last quarter to ship in, but it's not over our original plan. But we did have to take them out at the start of the fiscal year, but then once we knew that was back in, we adjusted appropriately.","Okay. So then in terms of 5G kind of ramp, definitely, as I said before, I think it will be larger. I think it will last longer, because it\u2019s so ambitious and there\u2019s so many \u2013 there is so many -- so much innovation even at the business model level of what's going to happen with 5G. But calling exactly the shape, I mean, heck, you know, I mean, the last quarter, we weren't saying that we were going to see it. Now, we're saying we're maintaining that 2020 mainly, but now, lo and behold, it appears that people are wanting to do -- start that deployment next year.","So I don't feel totally comfortable. I\u2019m telling you exactly how that rolls out. I do think it will still somewhat be there, and that's why I want to caution people on that, but integrate over time, it's nothing to be a big opportunity for us and it will be a long opportunity because data bandwidth is going crazy and people want low latency and high bandwidth. So that build out is going to be very substantial. Not only wires by the way, I mean, that's wire too, the entire network has to go and get upgraded. ","Operator","Your last question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Thanks guys. I guess I'll try and ask that 5G question in another way. I\u2019ve been doing this for way too long. How far ahead of plan is your 5G, I know you\u2019re not going to give us the revenue, but if you look at the revenue you have right now, are we one, two, three quarters ahead of where you thought that would be and then I know you're not going to talk about like the curve, but if you go back and look at previous upgrades in air interface standards, how long was it from sort of the original or excuse me, the initial ramp until peak and then do you think that this one, the 5G could be a longer ramp from the initial until the peak?","Victor Peng","Okay. So, the first part of your question is how far ahead and you said one, two, or three. I guess what I would say, in order of magnitude, you\u2019re probably right, probably more than two, three kind of ish, I would say. And then in terms of, again, that\u2019s tougher. I really and look, I'm not going to claim that the vision to be quite candid. But I do talk a lot of customers right and technologist people. So having said that, what I would say is that, this is definitely going to be broader. It is very, very ambitious and by the way and to add another big macro trend into this, everybody is looking at artificial intelligence, machine learning in the network. Right. That's going to bring a whole another level of things. So just given how ambitious and how changing this is going to be, not just the traditional markets. I do think it will be just broader. That would be my qualitative. I certainly don't think I\u2019m smart enough to call the delta to the peak. But, you know what, when we get a whole lot closer to it, the future is hard to predict. The predictions are hard, especially about the future. ","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Matt Poirier","Great.

With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and then we'll open the call for questions. Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information as currently available and that actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. In the December quarter, Xilinx sales were $587 million, down 2% sequentially, which was at the low end of our guidance range. 28 nanometer sales were particularly strong during the quarter reaching a $100 million with material sales from all product families. Broad-based Kintex sales led the growth with the significant contribution from Virtex and Zynq sales more than doubled. Sales from the Mainstream and Base categories both declined sequentially.","From an end market perspective, sales from communications and data center were approximately flat in the December quarter, slightly lower than we had forecast. Strong wireless sales associated with China LTE deployments were offset by weaker than anticipated telecom and data center. Top tier wired customers performed as expected but the weakness came predominantly from our mid-tier customers.","Industrial and aerospace and defense sales declined as expected driven by industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement. Aerospace and defense business was approximately flat better than expected due to strength in a couple of un-forecasted programs. ","Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive was slightly down driven almost entirely by expected declines from consumer.","Gross margin was 69.2% for the quarter in line with our guidance of 69%. Operating expenses were 203 million including amortization of 2.6 million. Also included in the operating expenses was a $19 million reversal of a contingent litigation reserve associated with a settlement of a patent litigation matter that was previously charged to the P&L in both Q4 FY12 and Q2 FY14.","Other income and expense was a net expense of $5 million, less than forecast due primarily to higher dividend and interest income associated with our investment portfolio. Net income for the quarter was $176 million or $0.61 per diluted share including a $0.06 per diluted share impact associated with the previously mentioned litigation reversal.","Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $216 million before $11 million in CapEx during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 288 million. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $97 million during the quarter and now have repurchased approximately $170 million of shares through this fiscal year. There was a 15.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investment increased $44 million to approximately $3.7 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $2.4 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased by $23 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 114 days, up from a 102 days in the prior quarter. The growth in inventory is related to increasing safety stock on new products in anticipation of higher future demand.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of FY14. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up slightly sequentially. We are expecting continued strong growth from our 28 nanometer product families. Mainstream products are expected to be up sequentially and base products are expected to be down. From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be up sequentially driven by continued strength from China LTE as well as growth from wired communications as a result of both increased 28 nanometer sales and increases from mid-tier customers. The most notable applications are in the areas of data center, metro, Ethernet and access.","We expect sales growth from the industrial and aerospace and defense segment, driven by all three secondary markets: test, defense and ISM.","Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be down driven by declines in consumer. As a result we are expecting total sales to increase 2% to 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 54%.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 68%, the slight decline in sequential gross margin percent is primarily related to a faster than anticipated ramp of our Kintex products to customers supporting China LTE deployment. We are currently expecting a record breaking quarter in the wireless segment. ","Operating expenses in the March quarter are expected to be approximately $226 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. As a result we expect our R&D and SG&A guidance for the full year fiscal year '14 to be approximately $492 million and $378 million respectively. Amortization is expected to be $10 million and litigation continues to be $9.4 million. ","Other income and expense for Q4 FY \u201914 is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 289 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","","Moshe Gavrielov","","Thanks Jon, good afternoon to you, all. I continue to be delighted with our new product sales. Collectively these products have increased nearly 80% on a year-over-year basis and now represent 38% total sales. Our 28-nanometer product generation demonstrated the most aggressive growth reaching a $100 million in revenue, easily surpassing our $90 million target. ","Continuing to demonstrate the depth and quality of the industry\u2019s broadest portfolio, sales were driven by all of the 28-nanometer product families. This was led by our midrange Kintex-7, and high-performance Virtex-7 families. Additional sales from Zynq, more than doubled sequentially, as key designs in wireless comms, industrial, aerospace and defense applications began shipping in production. ","Exiting calendar year 2013 we estimate our share of this node to be at least 70% for the full year. The remarkable success of our 28-nanometer product generation has driven significant total PLD gains for the second consecutive calendar year. The March quarter, we are very confident 28-nanometer sales will continue to grow, driven both by accelerated wireless deployment and wired comms strength. This will enable us to exceed $350 million in revenue for fiscal year 2014, significantly beyond our initial goal of $250 million.","This past quarter we continue to achieve multiple industry, first at the 20-nanometer node. We shipped the industry first 20-nanometer product continuing to execute on a very aggressive rollout of our All Programmable portfolio, the UltraScale product portfolio delivers the industry\u2019s only ASIC-class programmable architecture and extends our market-leading Kintex, Virtex, FPGA, and 3D IC families.","We also announced a record-breaking $4.4 million logic cell device, more than doubling our industry leading highest capacity Virtex-7 device thus achieving two consecutive generations of high-end leadership and delivering an extra node of customer value. These devices deliver high capacity of the 20-nanometer nodes and what our competition has announced that the node beyond that 16, plus 40-nanometer node.","Finally, at the end of December we take out the first Virtex UltraScale device, the Virtex UltraScale 20-nanometer family having no direct competition, only Xilinx is delivering the technology needed for next generation high performance Smart system. The industry\u2019s broadest and most differentiated 28-nanometer portfolio ramping at a phenomenal rate with multiple industry first demonstrating what we -- that we are already delivering a generation ahead of 20-nanometer, we are very well positioned to drive even more share gains against both (indiscernible) traditional PLD competition. ","Look forward to providing you an update at our analyst meeting on February 11, in San Francisco. ","Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for Q&A session.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","","Jon, you said in your prepared comments that you thought in the March quarter that wireless would be in a record. I am kind of curious, how much is China LTE now as a percent of the comms? What kind of sequential growth do you think you will see and every time we hear record, I guess we in Wall Street start to worry about kind of a peak and so I am kind of curious as to, versus the potential of where you think this could go, where do you think the March quarter will be?","Jon Olson","","John, well thanks for this question because I kind of had the same thought process and I was hoping someone would ask this question about it. This is far from where we think the peak is going to be. I think I would like to kind of take you back a little bit in our last time we had a peak was I would say around the peak of the 3G rollout in China, but the dynamics are a little bit different here for LTE from the standpoint of, we have been participating on a regular basis in the rollout in other geographies beyond China and we continue to have a really good solid business underneath that and then we started layering China on top of that and then later on Europe kicking-in where we actually see a few more little finds that things moving forward there. We are expecting wireless to be well above our historic peak as the LTE rollout hits us over the next several years. So, we're looking really very forward to that. ","If you look at our overall communications business we were I'd say a little bit disappointed because we were flat and that was really because wireless was up and wired was down. And the incremental part driven by China was a significant driver of that growth. We really don\u2019t want talk about the specifics of exactly how much is in China and not, but quite frankly we are in the very beginning stages there. And with respect to the guide for next quarter and talking about that we are seeing all OEMs come to us with orders and discussions about the long-term supply chain of what they think they need. Now that doesn\u2019t mean we have good have visibility, it just means that they are saying while things are turning on now in China and we need more parts for March and beyond, what is the prognosis like that from a capacity perspective.","So, I think we really are just now getting in to the beginning of an aggressive ramp here although it will be hard for us to forecast quarter-to-quarter most likely. ","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Jon Olson","","Next question please.","Operator","","Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America","","Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a clarification question for Jon and the real question for Moshe. So, on the clarification Jon, if wireless remains the key growth driver in 2014, should the model gross margins to be closer to 68% rather than the 69% i.e. will the other quarters look similar to what you are guiding for March in terms of gross margin? ","And then the question for Moshe, Moshe if we look back a number of years we have seen this PLD market share shift at almost every node. You guys are very strong at 65%, Altera at 40% then you were at 28%. What caused that before and why can\u2019t that same thing repeat whereby Altera starts to gain some momentum, what do you see to give you confidence that that same thing will not happen again? Thank you.","Jon Olson ","","So, on the overall gross margin forecast, I am really not going to forecast the next quarter or the next year, we will definitely talk about that at the Analyst Day that\u2019s coming up in a couple of weeks but we are very confident about our gross margin position. And when you think about the -- I'll say the more abrupt growth of our product -- 20 nanometer product generation, we are not at the -- we are not down the cost curve totally here, right. So, we are talking about an acceleration of fast shipments, a lot of shipments early in the generation of the product. So, we're still very confident about our gross margin position on a go-forward basis and this is not kind of the harbinger of some lowering in the short-term quite frankly albeit there will be up and downs and some fluctuations around the midpoint and this is just one of those situations.","Moshe Gavrielov","","Vivek, thanks for the question. We'll give you a more profound answer on the February the 11th as to what we are doing to maintain and continue our leadership. I don\u2019t think there is a physical rule of nature that says that you need to swap leadership, it all depends on what your strategy is and how well you execute. And this point in time I am very confident that we are doing everything to retain and expand our leadership but we'll go into more detail in February. Thanks for the question.","Operator","","Next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah - Nomura","","Yes, thanks a lot. Jon, I was hoping to just get a little bit more color on the gross margin weakness. You highlighted Kintex, but my understanding is this product line has been growing as a percentage of sales and obviously you guys had very good gross margin performance last year. And then Moshe on 28-nanometer, you highlighted your current share at around 70%, do you think that\u2019s a number you can sustain through the remainder of this year? Thanks a lot.","Jon Olson"," ","So, while it is true we have been growing 28-nanometer quite profoundly but you also have to look at the end market mix as well as the product mix. And so it isn\u2019t clearly just about Kintex, how many Kintexs was resell, it\u2019s also an end market exposure and the wireless end market because of the concentration of costumers and the very high volume that we're shipping in there, there is definitely a pricing discount versus cost perspective there and we talked about the fact that our wireless end market has had gross margin characteristics lower than some of our other end markets. And so to me this is really a transitional product end market mix as that will work itself out over time.","Moshe Gavrielov","","And with regards to market share going forward, our public goal was 60%, our internal goal was 70% we've grown over the past -- the product taped out in 2010 and now has three years of production; it\u2019s grown from 50% to 60% to 70% market share over the past year. We\u2019re going to continue to do everything with the breadth of the portfolio to capitalize on that. And I am delighted with where we are and we intend to continue to provide this leadership whether it\u2019s 70 or around 70, it\u2019s going to be much higher than it ever has been at least for us. And it\u2019s in the breadth and depth of the product offering which is the level of execution which are second to none. ","So I think there are sustainable elements there, it\u2019s not a fluke it\u2019s not one element of the product offering, it\u2019s not prototyping, it\u2019s not wireless. It\u2019s a whole host of things which are hitting at different times and are accumulating to deliver this and next station is that they will continue to hit as we continue going forward. We will also address some of these issues in February in more debt. ","Jon Olson","","Next question please?","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Baird","","Is this trend of Kintex relative to your expectation implying that perhaps there is a mix shift versus prior node where demand is stronger in the mid-range than it used to be? And if that\u2019s the case do you think that the market will give the high end of 28 centimeter more than half of the geometry node as it has been in the past.","Jon Olson","","So Tristan excellent question, there is a transitional just happening and that is, there is an emerging need for a higher performance, more cost oriented product and there are certain markets that if that product doesn\u2019t exist they just won\u2019t use a low end product and they won\u2019t use a high end product, because the low end product won\u2019t have the right performance, the high end product won\u2019t have the price, so they will evidently use something else. So I do believe that there is a place for this, it is growing at a rapid rate, it is to some extent in some cases replacing the high end, so we do expect the percentage of the high end to be smaller than it has, having said that, we believe that primarily the high end benefit and the same expansion there is through replacing [indiscernible] for applications such as [indescribable] et cetera.","So I don\u2019t think that it necessarily is -- it doesn\u2019t cannibalize an existing market, what it does is things shift, with regards to percentages what we will likely share with you is where we are at 28 and maybe make some projections, but it\u2019s really difficult. I will highlight that we have an exceptional product offering across the board 28, and that includes the high end and if you look at our growth, our existing business a lot of it was high end and our anticipation is that on the Virtex side there will be significant growth this quarter. So it is growing at a nice click already, Kintex due to the wireless market is coming out of a shoot much, much faster but the Virtex part is starting to catch up. And I believe that within a year or so we\u2019ll catch up fully and we will have a great position there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson","","I am wondering if you can comment a little bit more about the consumer end market, I think you highlighted that end market as a weak spot in the quarter ended the outlook, can you elaborate?","Moshe Gavrielov","","Yes the consumer end market for us does have underlying trends that happen as the introduction of I'll say high end electronics come to the market. And one of the biggest applications that\u2019s been going on in addition to more pro-consumer video cameras and things like that, it really is around next generation televisions which is around the ultra-high definition and 4K 2K television. And we've been doing extremely well in that market, we have traditionally when new television technology comes out, we traditionally have played a role in that and this particular movement that\u2019s going on or evolution that\u2019s going on, we\u2019re in a very well position and these trends tend to last for a year or so and then generally when they get into extremely high volume televisions, that will [indiscernible] or some other kind of technology. So we are kind of in the middle of enjoying that ramp and because of the difficulty of trying to get this technology to work by the television manufacturers, [FPJ] has turned out to be a really useful thing even in I'll say the small to medium volumes now which is a little bit different than previous -- over the previous generations.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup","Thanks, Jon. You made the point in your prepared remarks that wireless is coming to a record level on the March quarter and yet you\u2019re guiding overall revenues could be below consensus. I wonder if you can then talk about the prospects you see for your business outside the comms and whether or not you think consensus is actually missing something in the way you think about revenue growth for 2014?","Jon Olson","So, I think that it\u2019s an interesting question, while we do see some modest growth in some of these other stuffs end markets I\u2019ve talked about, the biggest move is actually are going on in communications for us next quarter and coming from a down quarter in the wired side, the compare is easier for us to go up a little bit, but quite frankly the wireless part of the growth is a much bigger percentage of our forecast for next year. And so I\u2019ll talk about this a little bit more in a couple weeks but as you step back and look about -- look at where we thought we would go, have revenue this year going into the year and where we\u2019re ending up, we're actually extremely pleased and that delta is explained by the 28-nanometer growth that Moshe talked about in his remarks on a full year basis.","We\u2019re doing extremely well. Adoption is as good as we thought and while there are pockets of slowness and ramping in some areas, we have other pockets where people are ramping at a much more rapid pace than we thought. So don't take too much on this record wireless comment, it was put in there primarily to signal the fact that we have such a strong play this time in the wireless sub-segment as a result of our Kintex and Zynq products that we are getting a significant share this time of this new generation of technology on a worldwide basis in a much bigger show than we did in previous node generation. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.","Srini Pajjuri - CLSA Securities","Thank you, Jon. I want clarification on a question. First, did you have any 10% customers or do you anticipate any in the March quarter and then the question is you mentioned that the mid-tier telecom and datacenter customers for a week, if you could give us a little bit more clarification as to what\u2019s going on there, looks like you\u2019re expecting that customers to come back again in the March quarter? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Yes and the answer of your first question is no, we did not have a 10% customer this past quarter and we don\u2019t forecast whether we are for the future. We are open for business so we\u2019ll take orders from anybody, maybe we\u2019ll end up having one who knows, but if you look at our history we really have that because we have such a broad-based balance around our customers, but I guess we\u2019ll have to wait and see about the March quarter. ","From a mid-tier comms perspective, some it is customer specific to some things that we -- the customers were clearing out inventory in two or three places and some of it are -- is I think an explanation of that the overall economy and IT spend is not as robust as we might like it to be or thought it to be.","Our new customers continue to deploy new technology very rapidly and so that\u2019s been the harbinger for strength there. The mid-tier and smaller customers not quite as much there and their growth is still depended on legacy designs that really aren\u2019t moving quite as well, so a few customers that are doing inventory correction and a few customers that I think have had overall weak demand and so there is a bit of a pause there. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher Danely - JPMorgan","Thanks, guys. Hey Jon or Moshe, can you just maybe run through your major end markets for this calendar year in which you expect to grow the most or the least since you\u2019ve seen the indicated -- China communication was pretty much as you expected last year, what would you expect from the comm business and maybe the China communications business this year?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, Chris nice try, February 11, San Francisco, we\u2019re going to talk about the whole year, the markets break them down et cetera. Now it\u2019s just -- so I won\u2019t appear to be rude, 28-nanometer is driving our growth wireless and wired are benefiting incredibly this current quarter and what we\u2019re seeing is that expansion into other markets is happening at each market at the natural rate that it happened. So for example just a measurement we used, the largest FPJs really early, we continue to see that on an ongoing basis because we have the largest most popular ones, but then it gets deployed on a broader basis, so we would expect that over time to grow. Why it takes a little longer to go into production but thankfully its happening, wireless, the success is extremely broad and to the extent that you should see growth and wireless as the one which is happening at the fastest rate due to the very strong product cycle, but we will give you more details, we just -- you know we\u2019re not going to have anything to tell you on February 11th except give you another book which you may or may not appreciate.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question, relative to the China wireless ramp, I was wondering if you could talk about the -- the mix of products you\u2019re shipping into base stations versus radio heads and whether you expect that to change a lot over the next few quarters as some of the complexion of the deployment changes, and then can you maybe talk about, when you expect 20 nanometer revenue to be material to the P&L, is it going to be as much as the year out or is it going to be sooner than that?","Jon Olson","On the China wireless composition you know clearly radio cards are the leadership in terms of volume and we are getting a lot of this business is around radio heads and radio cards, so there\u2019s a lot of that activity from an ordering perspective. And baseband and back haul are the other two wireless segments which account for I would say the remaining 50% if you will, the 50% of radio, pardon, 50% of the other. And we are getting certainly getting baseband orders coming through et cetera, and backhaul I would say would be the last in terms of the percentages, so it\u2019s a bit of an overweight towards radio right now in terms of the deployment which I think is the most critical part to get the new frequency, the new bands deployed from a carrier perspective. So I would say that\u2019s what\u2019s going on now, and I would expect that to moderate over time but still a radio leaning for the next few quarters. Then with respect to 20 nanometer materiality, it\u2019s a year out, I mean if it\u2019s supposed to be handicapping over under a year, it\u2019s a year out, I mean we\u2019re shipping for revenue today, our first product that we take out, but it\u2019s going in the customer\u2019s prototype wars and things like that, our design win activity is picking up significantly in this area but realistically any significant revenue is out of here anyway.","Moshe Gavrielov","Yes, and Jim just to clarify that further, you just need to look at 28, that\u2019s the fastest growing node we\u2019ve seen, we\u2019re at $100 million, that\u2019s 16% of our revenue and this is three years after we taped out the product, the nature of the markets we service is it takes some time to get the product inserted into the customer designs and they typically deploy on a delayed rate so, you know in this case it took three years to reach $100 million and that\u2019s the fastest it\u2019s been done before, so in terms of having some revenue which is significant then here is a good element and in terms of getting 15% I think you can model, three years is a good proxy for that, and you know. So the question is how do you define significant? Is it 3% or 15%? If it\u2019s 15% use three years. If it\u2019s 3% then that can happen much faster.","Rick Muscha","Our next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley ","Great, thank you. I wonder if you could help us size the Zynq opportunity. You mentioned it doubled sequentially. If you can just give us any kind of qualitative estimate of where that is, and if you\u2019re not willing to do that, just kind of help us understand where it could go over time.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay, we don\u2019t break it out. It\u2019s still small numbers as in just under $10 million and it was the last of the families we introduced and it was a totally new concept with leadership, what we\u2019re finding and this is not surprising is that the designing cycle, because of the software involved, it has an embedded processor, processor takes longer. Our expectation is that in a year or so it will move, the numbers will be much higher. Now what is driving that is wireless and secondarily automotive. Automotive takes a little longer because it\u2019s dependent on model years on that\u2019s a slow moving industry and so it will grow during this year. I\u2019m very confident of that driven by wireless but more accelerated growth driven by other markets, primarily automotive and then industrial is going to happen next calendar year.","Rick Muscha","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Gabriel Ho - BMO","This is Gabriel Ho calling in for Ambrish. I\u2019m just wondering if you can comment on last time buy, if there is an impact on the revenues of gross margins for the December quarter and also where are we in terms of the last time buy.","Jon Olson","Sure Dave. As noted, our base product family continue to decline as if you look back over the last several quarters we have and that\u2019s where the specific set of parts that we\u2019ve been holding for customers for an extended amount of time due to the BAB [ph] line closure situation, that we were -- we had to deal with respect to our foundry. And so while -- as I stated before we\u2019ve always had underlying quarterly run rate going on here and the shipment of that inventory, we\u2019ve been building up over the last several years will continue at least through the remainder of next fiscal year, and it is dependent on when customers take it or when they\u2019ve agreed to take it and all those things have been worked out.","So with respect to the December quarter, we definitely had shipments there. I\u2019m really not going to talk about any specific customers or parts and its impact on margin. But quite frankly, with the base products continue to decline you got to believe the underlying run rate there has been more or less constant with some preservation as depending on customer need. So it\u2019s about all I think I can give you on that particular topic.","Rick Muscha","","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna with JPMorgan Securities.","Alex Gauna - JMP Securities","That\u2019s JMP Securities. I was wondering if you could talk about, last quarter you guided turns to 53%, came in at the low end of guidance, now you\u2019re at 54%. I am wondering was it programs that you had anticipated coming through maybe got pushed out a little bit or was there a turns area that you missed a little bit more that you think is going to come through in this quarter? And just to clarify, last quarter you talked about initial signs that things were picking up in 4G China infrastructure deployments and you\u2019d expect the acceleration in December. Did you get that acceleration in December and as a part of the strength in the March quarter, is that acceleration continuing? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Sure Alex. Relative to the turns number, it is always a bit of an art when you have as many customers as we have in different design cycle wins and you only know less than half of your -- you have less than half of your business booked probably in the quarter. So there is all kinds of puts and takes that got under in the quarter with customers pulling things in, pushing things out based on their scheduling and their ultimate demand needs. And I think the reason in my remarks I talked about weaker mid-size and smaller customers in the wired, meaning the networking and telecom space was really that; we had anticipated orders from some of those customers at a greater level than we\u2019ve actually received.","And distribution in certain geographies were a little on the light side of what we had anticipated and some of those go into the smaller wired customers. So it really was more around that comms flavor than any other single area that I can point to. And if you go back and look at our history in terms of percentage of turns, anything in the 52% to 54% is right in the wheelhouse of where we have typically ended up. And again I talked about some of the customers that were weaker in this past quarter are going to be strong this next quarter. That is also an estimate on our part, because we don\u2019t necessarily have hard orders for everything.","From a 4G pickup there is no -- in China there is no doubt that we had increased revenue in December over the September quarter and then we have another step up again in March. This in my mind is very consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying over the last five or six quarters around how China is going to start slow and accelerate versus have some rocket ship going on in one quarter, that\u2019s been our view all along, and I think at least through December we\u2019re on track to where we thought deployments would be, and the speed and the pace of what\u2019s going on and we\u2019re very early in that whole process.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities","Hi. Thanks. Moshe, given that there is still a bunch of new designs going on for 4G infrastructure, I\u2019m wondering if anything has changed with the FPGA content, relative to 3G? I think historically we\u2019ve talked about some sort of multiplier on total dollar content. But given the mix kind of moving, it sounds like at least in this initial run of designs to Kintex-7, do you think anything is changing?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, Kintex-7 was architected and executed to be the ideal and de facto standard FPGA solution for wireless and in particular for 4G. So we see the level of integration inside the FPGA growing across the board. So the percentage of developed materials which is covered by the FPGA is growing. You\u2019re right in highlighting that 4G is going to be deployed over several years in several geographies. China is getting huge level of attention now and that after there was some deployment in North America, which isn\u2019t yet complete and some deployment in Korea, which actually is more or less complete, and Japan which is further along, the rest of the world needs to catch up.","Amazingly I just spent some time in India and it appears, and I know that everyone -- the India deployment of technology is like Verizon, the closer you get to it, the further it goes away. But we live in hope. And after I was there, and I saw firsthand, how bad the coverage is, and I was in seven cities, it was bad everywhere. The expectation is that they are going to more or less skip 3G. So they are going to terminate their 3G deployment and then hopefully they will skip straight to 4G and the expectation is that that will happen some point in time after the elections which is due, I think in April or May of this year.","I know that isn\u2019t a great hope, but well I am using, the reason I am using that is it\u2019s an example of how long this 4G deployment is and how distributed and fragmented it is over the world. And what is happening is, is actually the next generation after that where there is already rumblings of deployments, which I believe is going to be led by Korea. So, that\u2019s a long answer, FPGAs is more and more central to these devices and they have a larger portion of the developed material. So it looks good. I am very bullish on wireless infrastructure deployment.","Rick Muscha","Next question please.","Operator","We seem to have no further questions at this time.","","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today.

Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and then we will open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. Fiscal 2015 was another strong year of profitability for the company, with operating income up 31.8%, the highest in four years. Industrial and aerospace and defense category increased 7% for the year, representing a record 39% of total sales. The communications segment declined 5% impacted by lower than expected CapEx spend in many of our sub-applications. The broadcast consumer and automotive category decreased 2%. However, the automotive sub-segment grew significantly, increasing 30% during the year. For the company as a whole, fiscal year sales were $2.4 billion, flat with the prior year.","Gross margin was a record 70% for the fiscal year benefiting from end market mix as well as continued cost reduction and margin expansion initiatives across our product platform portfolio. In fiscal year 2015, we returned over 120% of our operating cash flow to shareholders, which represent about 40% of our revenues. This consisted of a record $306 million in dividend payout and a stock repurchase of 15.3 million shares for $650 million. The March quarter of fiscal 2015 marked the 10th consecutive year of dividend increases for the company putting Xilinx in a very elite group of technology companies. Cash flow per share has increased at a compound annual rate of 14% in the past 10 years, driven by a combination of gross margin expansion, disciplined expense controls, working capital management and share repurchase.","Turning now to a discussion of the March quarter, Xilinx sales were $567 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $160 million as forecasted. Sales from communications and datacenter declined 7% sequentially and were weaker than anticipated. Wired communication was approximately flat as expected, while wireless sales decreased double-digits. The weakness in the wireless segment was primarily due to continued softness in North America and a weakening in China LTE business. Industrial and aerospace and defense business also decreased although not as much as anticipated during the quarter. Expected declines from defense were partially offset by better than expected business from both industrial scientific medical as well as test and measurement.","Lastly, broadcast consumer and automotive was better than expected with automotive achieving a record quarter, while broadcast was flat and consumer was down. Gross margin was 59.9% for the quarter better than anticipated, primarily as a result of product and customer mix although we continue to be focused on driving improvements and profitability. Combined R&D and SG&A expense were $211 million, significantly lower than forecasted, primarily as a result of lower stock-based compensation expense in addition to continued cost efforts.","Operating income was $159 million, including amortization of $2.4 million and a $24 million restructuring charge or $0.08 per diluted share. The restructuring charge reflects the impact of streamlining certain internal organizations as well as the impact of a transition from sales reps to a direct sales model for certain customers. Other income was $1 million, higher than guided primarily due to an $8 million gain or $0.03 per diluted share from the sale of land.","Net income for the quarter was $135 million or $0.50 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $166 million before $6 million in CapEx during the quarter. Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million, slightly less than forecasted and down 25 million shares from the same quarter a year ago. There was a 5.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $175 million during the quarter and paid $70 million in dividends.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat sequentially at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $16 million sequentially, but days increased to 136.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year \u201816. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. Both wired and wireless communications are expected to decline. Wired communications remains sluggish although data center will likely increase. Wireless will be impacted by slowing China LTE builds in the near-term. We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be down driven primarily by continued expected decreases from A&D. Lastly, we expect broadcast consumer and automotive to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be flat to down 4% sequentially. And the midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 47%. The lower turns rate is primarily due to a couple of large customers being more fully booked to expectations and a regional distributor transition.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the June quarter are expected to be approximately $210 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The Q1 fiscal \u201816 operating expense level will be at its lowest level for the year due to lower tape-out activity and timing of expenses to ramp up headcount post-restructuring. The headcount additions will largely be driven by hiring in the sales force and to a lesser degree in R&D.","For the full year, we are lowering our spending forecast as follows. R&D is expected to be between $530 million and $540 million. SG&A will be between $340 million and $360 million. Amortization of intangibles will be approximately $8 million. Other income and expense for the June quarter will be a net expense of $12 million, due to lower interest income and anticipated hedging losses. For the full year, other interest and expense will be a net expense of approximately $33 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 266 million shares. The tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. We are very pleased with the strength of our 28-nanometer products, which exceeded $160 million. As expected, we continue to expand the breadth of 28-nanometer sales contributions. The strength of our Virtex-7 high end family and Zynq all programmable SoC was a particular highlight, driving 28-nanometer sales growth in wired comms, industrial and automotive applications. For fiscal year 2015, 28-nanometer revenue reached $580 million driven by broad-based growth from all end-markets and each of the four 28-nanometer product families. 28-nanometer product generation continues to be the most successful node in history and we believe will have longest life of any node. As we discussed our Investor Day last month, we are targeting [Technical Difficulty] of sales to grow approximately 30% in fiscal year 2016.","Gross margin performance was another significant highlight for both the fourth quarter and the year. Gross margin increased 69.9% in the quarter significantly better than forecasted and a record 70.2% for fiscal year 2015. Proven formula for successful execution, establish the 28-nanometer continues to yield excellent results at 20-nanometer with the UltraScale family. Leveraging our world class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry are now delivering the industry\u2019s first and only 20-nanometer FPGAs volume production. Based on key customer feedback, we are more than one year ahead of the competition in terms of product advancement and quality. Additionally, we are shipping the industry only high performance ASIC class 20-nanometer high-end product offering with Virtex UltraScale.","Finally, with our second generation of 3D IC technology, we are shipping the industry\u2019s largest device delivering more than 4x density of competitive devices. We are currently shipping 20-nanometer products to approximately 100 discrete customers, demonstrating the broad-based acceptance of this family. This past quarter, sales from our 20-nanometer node were $5 million and we expect these sales to double in the June quarter. 60-nanometer node, we launched the UltraScale Plus family of FPGAs, 3D ICs and Zynq MP SoCs, combining embedded memory, 3D on 3D, and multiprocessing SoC technologies. On the system level, the UltraScale Plus family provides 2x to 5x greater system level performance per watt significantly more systems integration and intelligence and the highest level of security and safety. We continue to anticipate the first tape-out of our 60-nanometer FinFET Plus process to be this quarter.","During the March quarter, we also strengthened our family of SDX software defined development environment with the launch of the SD SoC product. This environment enables a much larger software and systems development community to program our Zynq SoCs and MP SoCs. Target high growth opportunities, areas such as datacenter acceleration, software defined networking, embedded vision and the industrial Internet of Things. Despite the near-term revenue growth challenges, I continue to be confident in our strategy to resume top line growth. Additionally, we are driving increased efficiencies in our operating model to improve productivity and appropriately align spending levels for the fiscal year \u201816 sales outlook we have previously provided.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Moshe, you might have just answered my first question in your prepared comments. But I just want to confirm that as you look at your full year fiscal \u201816 revenue guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day, I think a flat to up 2 that you still think that\u2019s the right range to look at. And I guess given the less than expected start in the June quarter, how do we think about linearity of that growth to get to that full year number?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, John, that continues to be our target and it obviously will start from a low point if we hit our range, but we expect to see it grow during the year and we are confident that as the communications business starts to recover that will be one of the numerous fibers of the growth together with all of the technology elements that I referred to before.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful, Moshe. And then specifically your comments around China, to what extent do you think this is a pause in vacation build-out in China versus perhaps too much inventory with some of the equipment guys that we need to bring there. I am just trying to get a sense of how much of this do you think is a real pause in demand versus perhaps a realignment of kind of inventory within the supply chain?","Jon Olson","Yes, John, this is Jon. Let me kind of take that one. So, it\u2019s always a little of both, right, but meaning in general, the Chinese manufacturers try to get ahead of the awards as much as they can. But when there is a following demand situation like we have now or delay I would say, particularly from the FD ramp perspective, it is really more about that pause. And one, the ramp starts to build a little more precipitously. We did think all along that our communications business, wireless specifically would build throughout the year. So, that part while it maybe starting off a little weaker than we anticipated, it isn\u2019t really radically scaring as much at this point in time. They are just \u2013 China is just going through some overall CapEx modifications and the FD stuff is going to happen. It\u2019s just going to happen, start a little bit slower, but we do think we have accommodated that in our full year forecast.","John Pitzer","Thanks guys. I appreciate it.","Moshe Gavrielov","Next question. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to just continue that discussion, I understand the China impact on wireless. I am just curious why the wired business is not growing? When Broadcom reported yesterday, they thought the datacenter demand or the wired business demand, they see picking up. So, I am curious is this just lumpiness, is it just the timing of different projects? What will drive wired demand for you?","Jon Olson","Yes. So, we were very pleased with our 28-nanometer growth in the quarter. So, new products are growing, including datacenter this quarter. So, we had good contribution from the new product category. It\u2019s really some of the older stuff that wasn\u2019t quite as strong as we had anticipated in some of the sub-applications. So, I would say we saw some \u2013 and I don\u2019t really know the details of all the sub-segments that Broadcom ran, but we did see strength in these new products. So, as those build throughout the year, meaning the new programs and some of the customer differences, I think we will see good growth in the wired market from new products continue throughout the year.","Vivek Arya","Got it. Very helpful, Jon. And then as my follow-up, I am curious what your views are on this potential combination of Intel and Altera. Is that \u2013 if not were to happen, is that a net positive neutral or does it present any kind of risk for you and if that combination does happen would you also need to take any steps towards consolidation? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Well, in the 15 minutes of saying for the programmable world, I am sort of surprised that this was the third question and not the first, but thanks for asking it. And from our perspective, regardless of whether that happens or it doesn\u2019t happen whether it\u2019s rumor, whether it\u2019s true or not, we are very confident. And the reason that we are very confident is that we continue to distance ourselves from the competition and we believe we are poised to now deliver a three-peat. We have won a 28-nanometer, we believe we have huge leadership at 20-nanometer and we are very confident in our position at 16-nanometer. We have leadership with our ASIC class tools and also the new tools the software defined environments are huge enablers for business expansion. If this rumor does come to pass and this acquisition will happen we believe that will be a net positive for us, because it will give us the additional significant advantage of being the only vendor with this very service-oriented business, with the total focus, the best foundry, strategic relationship with leadership on the roadmap and generally continuity of operations. So, whether it happens or not, we don\u2019t know, but our position is very strong and we are very confident in where we are and we believe that this gap between us and the competition will just grow going forward.","Vivek Arya","Thank you, Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Gabriela Borges","Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I know you discussed a little bit on the China dynamic in the communications market, maybe you could also comment on what you are seeing in North America I know you mentioned the softness in the March quarter but maybe there is a little bit of stabilization in June, is there any color on North America and maybe Europe and some of the other geographies as well? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Sure, Gabriela. The North America continues to be weak for us. I think we have had a couple of quarters of relatively weak transitions or weak revenue there. One of the bigger expansions that have gone on over the last year or so has been the Sprint deployment and they have slowed down substantially. There seems to be some CapEx spend financing things going on here and there, and that\u2019s been slower for us on a relative basis to how strong we are to the ultimate OEMs who won those contracts. We don\u2019t \u2013 best as what we can tell we don\u2019t think this is some sort of a permanent thing. Some of those things we are getting worked out as we talk to our customers in that particular area. I mean largely, the AT&T and Verizon businesses is add-ons and capacity extensions. Nothing significant going on there quite frankly in terms of the CapEx spend, it\u2019s really around Sprint and T-Mobile and we are well-positioned there. But it is definitely, decelerated over the last couple of quarters but we do not expect that to continue for the full year. Europe, while there has been some sales into Europe, it\u2019s still early and we don\u2019t have, I would say a clear view. We are counting on a big percentage of that business to come in until maybe very late in the fiscal year.","Gabriela Borges","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And as a follow-up if I may, could you help us think through the implications of the Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia merger and maybe any context you can provide based on what happened in 2006 which I think is the last time we saw customer consolidation? Thanks very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","So wireless generally is the market where, as you pointed out has been consolidated for some period of time. And we fundamentally believe that the \u2013 or at least I believe that the catalyst for all of this is the emergence of the very strong players in China and that is forcing the other non-Chinese players to bulk up and strengthen up. And from our perspective, both of these companies are significant customers of ours and as they merge if they come out strengthened that should improve our business. And we think that this will provide them with a better market position to compete against the other players who have been pulling ahead recently.","So, given our market position with these two players and the potential for growth with both of them, I think as they merge it will provide a growth path for us going forward assuming the combined player will emerge stronger as indeed they should. There does tend to be a little bit of confusion when it starts because these are two very large, very diverse companies with geographic footprints in different spaces. And I do believe that at least as they are doing the merger, there will be a little bit of hiatus, but then it will \u2013 as the merger is completed they will probably have renewed growth going forward.","Gabriela Borges","Appreciate all the color. Thanks very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess first, Moshe one on your side and still on that kind of comm infrastructure side of things. From as close as I can check, whether it was the end of market or Xilinx specifically we have had there quarters in a row of tough results, can you talk a little bit about what gives you the confidence that we are going to see a snapback in the back half of the year, especially on the wireline side where I believe on the last conference call you talked about being relatively puzzled as to why design wins weren\u2019t turning into revenue for Xilinx?","Moshe Gavrielov","So the reason we are confident that this needs to reverse is at some point there is a mismatch between the infrastructure requirements to the drivers which is basically a lot of this is driven by consumer and business demand. And we think that on the wired side that time is approaching and that our very strong product portfolio will enable us to capture that as it happens. There is an incessant need for an investment in the infrastructure. And I think it has been shortchanged for too long. So you are right in pointing out that we have been disappointed and that this has taken longer. And actually, we have predicted this before, but at this point what we are seeing is a lot of the designs that we reaped at the high end of the 28-nanometer are now moving to production and those got delayed roughly by a year vis-\u00e0-vis our initial expectations. So between the market demands and the design wins we have at 28-nanometer, where we do have visibility in them now moving and hence we made the comment on the growth of our Virtex-7 product offering. Those products are now starting to move into production. And we expect that to be a portion of this snapback. And then of course on the wireless side, there are elements which we expect as Jon elaborated on we expect China to have that need and it\u2019s only a question of when and that needs to start happening soon on the wireless infrastructure too.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thanks for all that detail. I guess as my quick follow-up, one for you Jon, on the OpEx side, great job controlling those expenses in the quarter and the guide. From your description of what\u2019s going on in lowering the full year by about 3%, it sounds like there is an aspect of tightening the belt overall and then also some timing issues on OpEx. Are you expecting us to exit this year at the same sort of OpEx level that we would have before and therefore fiscal \u201817 would kind of be the same as we would have thought before or is this truly a cut in OpEx levels longer term? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Yes. So I think the whole origin of the restructuring in the first place was around driving efficiency and getting more focused in areas particularly in the sales area to accelerate our wins of customers. And that was really the genesis for doing it. And we sat there in the March timeframe and Investor Day obviously we knew we were doing restructuring, but we never commented in advance on that for a variety of reasons. And in the guide that we gave in March there were certainly some things that weren\u2019t decided yet through our restructuring efforts even at early in March. And as we got through to really dissecting the sales organization and changing the focus away from reps to direct selling, this is where we have garnered the biggest part of the dollar drop and the change in our guide since March. So it\u2019s really reflective of us figuring out how to put the right resources in the right places. And sometimes that means you actually spend less when you have the right resources and that\u2019s the primary driver of what the reduction \u2013 the net reduction that we have going on.","Now on your question around the exit rate, as I said in my remarks, the first quarter is particularly low and that\u2019s because we haven\u2019t ramp headcount back up. I do think that the second quarter, we have a lot of more tape-outs going on and that goes \u2013 bounces around throughout the rest of the year. And our exit rate in \u2013 out of Q4 will suggest some tick up and would suggest that some tick up in FY \u201917. But \u2013 by the way, we are not there yet. So I am not signaling that we are going to have a tick up in FY \u201817. So it will look like the \u2013 that Q1 is low and then Q2, Q3, Q4 will be more flattish throughout the year. But we certainly aren\u2019t making a statement yet about FY \u201817 spending.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi. Thank you, Moshe. And I am sorry because actually we disappointed you with that question not being number one. I did have a follow-up on that and which is when you heard and if it\u2019s true that whatever price was offered and what was asked, did you fall off your chair or you said okay, Intel gets it. The Street doesn\u2019t get it that there is this huge opportunity for PLDs in the datacenter and I think Altera has quantified it as $1 billion in 2020. So, any thoughts around that would be very helpful? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, it\u2019s a rumor and the prices are a rumor and whether it\u2019s happening or not happening is a rumor too. We are delighted with the attention this gets and we think that obviously there is potential for growth. With regards to prices and all of that, it shows the perceived value of programmable logic, which I am a big believer in. So, I am delighted with that general trend. Hopefully, the entire world will see the light, but\u2026","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, Moshe. Thank you. Good luck.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra","Hi, good afternoon. Could you quantify the headwind from end-of-life products embedded in the June quarter guidance and is that headwind done by the end of the quarter?","Jon Olson","Yes. So, as we said in Investor Day, there would be some residual shipments into some of these major programs at the very beginning of the fiscal year \u201816, but at a much diminished rate. So, by the time we get to through the first half of our fiscal year which is end of the September, I would say a great deal that will be away and the biggest piece of it will be in June. So, I would say by the end of June it\u2019s largely gone, with some residual going on in the following quarters.","Tristan Gerra","Okay, thank you.","Jon Olson","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Will Stein","Thanks for taking my question. First, just a housekeeping one, you have reset guidance on OpEx, I just want to confirm you are keeping the gross margin guidance that you have offered previously for the full year?","Jon Olson","Yes, we are.","Will Stein","Great. And then the more substantial question I had is in the press release you talked about and I think at the Analyst Day, you talked about this as well these new software development tools that are targeted at datacenter and SDN and industrial IoT. I am wondering if you can help us understand whether that\u2019s expected to accelerate your growth through perhaps share gains versus Altera or is it versus some of the other maybe the other SoC vendors or is it to grow the market? Any color on the expected effect from these tools will be helpful?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, the expected \u2013 let me pose the challenge that we have. And if you look at our products, they, in numerous applications, enable our customers to achieve very attractive parameters in terms of performance per watt or price performance per watt. In other words, they can achieve a \u2013 they can implement differentiated highly competitive system. In order to do that, they need to go through a design cycle, which requires a certain set of skills. And in order to increase the population or universe of the users of our products, what we have done is we have developed these tools. These tools tend to be somewhat application-specific or it\u2019s not one size fits all. They tend to have different targets, but once you use these tools, you can enable usage by a broader set of customers and in particular, engineers with more of the software background and there are lot more software engineers then there are hardware engineers. And the reason we are doing it is in order to expand the SAM and the intention here is to provide a alternative \u2013 an attractive alternative to ASSP standard product. So, that\u2019s what this is. This is SAM expansion and this enables us to target markets, which today are serviced by ASSPs, because the engineers at some of these companies and datacenter is a very good example typically do not have hardware design skills and we are developing these tools to facilitate that expansion.","Will Stein","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from CLSA. Your line is open.","Ryan Goodman","Hey, thank you. It\u2019s Ryan Goodman in for Srini. So, I had another question on China LTEs. We have the FDD licensing now behind us, but it seems like the near-term trends are still softening a bit. So, I am just trying to understand how much of visibility you have here. We all know it\u2019s going to happen at some point, but are you starting to see some of these FDD orders coming in for the back half of the year or if not just what are your expectations there? And then also are you seeing any impact from potential tower sharing going on in China at this point?","Jon Olson","Sure. Ryan, the China \u2013 FD on the China LTE as we have already seen builds going on by the OEMs and we get more of our information through the OEMs than anywhere else. And so there already have been some builds and some shipments on the FD. So, this is more of a timing issue as best as we can tell and what our customers are telling us versus they are changing their longer term forecast for us, they don\u2019t. There is certainly no orders booked for the second half of the year at this point in time, because our lead times are generally pretty short. So, there is not a whole lot of impetus on the part of the OEMs to commit through a PO early even though they do provide us some guidance on forecast. And we don\u2019t see an overall lower number than we had anticipated maybe even in early March. So, really it\u2019s more of a temporary slowness the best as we can tell as anything else. On the tower sharing, no, we really haven\u2019t seen any impact whatsoever of the tower sharing. It doesn\u2019t even come up in our conversations. The issue there is really more about new towers, not old towers, so that\u2019s really not a factor.","Ryan Goodman","Okay, great. And then just different question on the cash side, so cash return was great this year, you forgot the history of it, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. Just any thoughts on where \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you have a formal target on it for the coming year or just maybe an idea of how you are thinking about it for the year versus operating cash flow?","Jon Olson","Yes. We don\u2019t have a formal target, but if we look at our \u2013 look at the history over the last 10 years, we have returned 100% of our operating cash. We did 120% last year. We have increased our dividend for the 10th year in a row. We will continue a share repurchase program on an opportunistic level. And we have stated as long as we don\u2019t have an acquisition target or something that is using any of the excess cash. At a bigger level, we will return cash to shareholders. So, I think you can count on us continuing to do that, but again, I am not going to make a commitment on a percentage.","Ryan Goodman","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian Ing","Yes, thank you. First question, could you talk about any sort of price increases you think your international distributor customers are seeing, whether it\u2019s based on currency or pricing more to reflect value and would there be any impact on demand or is demand pretty inelastic?","Jon Olson","Yes, we are not really seeing anything that\u2019s significant in the price increase area. I was concerned on the second part of your question about the demand impact, particularly at smaller customers and we have seen we had strong channel sales in this last quarter and we are forecasting strong channel sales again, including European, which I assume is the biggest source of your question, including on the European side. So, it\u2019s really not at this point has been a big of a deal as I was fearful of, but because while we had maybe a soft quarter a quarter or two ago, things have come back pretty nicely.","Ian Ing","Great. And then do you have any thoughts on the trends on the size of the FPGA design community, is it still growing and is it largely driven by Zynq? Do you have any sort of metrics to support that whether its design kits shipped or design kits installed?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, the Zynq product offering was a breakthrough offering. It was the generally the last part of the rollout. And as such, there was a large number of design wins. Now, those design wins, which were targeted at somewhat slower moving markets like industrial and automotive, those design wins are moving to production. So, it\u2019s a unique product. The number of design wins is phenomenal. We are learning because of its nature that in some cases it takes longer. It\u2019s also a more sophisticated product, hence it takes a little longer. To do the design it requires both software and hardware. It has a high performance embedded processor system. The number of design wins is just huge and the overall magnitude of the design win value on Zynq is very encouraging. It\u2019s very significant. And now, it is finally starting to grow a very healthy clip. So until last year, it was relatively negligible in terms of the portion of revenue, but now it's growing at a fast rate and as these applications in automotive, wireless and aero and industrial control are starting to hit production.","Jon Olson","I think you also \u2013 just you asked specific about design kits and our design board environment. I mean in terms of numbers of kits and boards, I mean it\u2019s just totally swamped in terms of numbers, all previous FPGA boards, because of the nature of the cost point or price point that many of these applications are going after, more of the $700 million versus the $800 or $900 kind of an ASP. And so both our distributor and Xilinx have a number of inexpensive boards and kits. And those numbers \u2013 the numbers of those that have been shipped out over the last couple of years is just really phenomenal. So we really think we are seeding the industry really well with these capabilities.","Ian Ing","Okay. Thanks Jon. Thanks Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys. It\u2019s Joe on for Chris. Thanks for letting me ask you question. So this past quarter, we had noticed a small bump in lead times for both you and your competitor, first, is that true. And then, in terms of responding to increasing customer demand, how long are the cycle times coming out of TSMC?","Jon Olson","Yes, so Joe, we really haven\u2019t had any, I would say, any appreciable lead time increase on a broad perspective. There is a class of products that we have had a little bit of \u2013 we have had some lead time increase, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s going to be that material of an impact to anything on our logistics. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been a particularly and if there is anything there that to concern anybody from a logistic supply perspective. What was the second part of your question again?","Unidentified Analyst","Fab cycle time?","Jon Olson","Fab cycle time, no we see no push out or lengthening of any fab cycle time. We are getting all the wafers we order and when we order them there is no \u2013 nothing going on there either for us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. And then we had also heard about possible consolidation in your distributor network, could you elaborate there if that\u2019s true?","Jon Olson","No, not really, it was our rep network where we are \u2013 as we terminated a variety of reps. In Japan, we are transitioning. We have a number of reps in Japan and the nature of that business is a little different than the rest of the world. And we are transitioning one of the reps to \u2013 into our other rep network. That\u2019s the only really transition that we have \u2013 excuse me, distributor in China, excuse me distributor in China, one distributor moving into our other distributors in terms of the business, but nothing other than those two things. So reps in the U.S. and Europe generally we are transitioning to direct sales. And then in Japan, there is a distributor that we are terminating and moving that business to other distributors that we already have.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Alex Gauna","Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I know you have already touched on this twice, but coming back to the implications of a potential Intel-Altera merger and Altera\u2019s optimism around data center acceleration through the massively parallel architectures of programmable logic. I am just wondering are you in fact involved, I know you aren\u2019t heavily exposed to the data center, but are you involved in using the FPGA architecture to accelerate workload, is this tens of million, hundreds of millions of opportunity for you. And then if you think about what\u2019s obviously happening with co-packaged FPGA and CPUs, how far in the future does it make sense in the workload acceleration sense to think about convergence wherein the processing and the FPGA are a single die? Thanks.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. There is a lot of questions there. So we think there is an opportunity there, that's why we have the SDX product which now we are releasing completely [ph] to our customers. And we strongly believe that, that together with a stronger focus on this market should enable us to reap the benefits of it. We think it\u2019s a significant market. There is \u2013 whether it\u2019s tens of millions or several hundreds of millions of dollars, we think it\u2019s going to take time to grow to those larger numbers and it takes quite a long time. And we are committed to having the best solution with regards to acceleration which addresses those markets. And whether its X86-based or ARM-based or whatever approach then we are going to pursue solutions for that market. So now I think we are well positioned and the key to our leadership is now in the software which enables achieving or getting at that acceleration in the most efficient way. And that\u2019s how we view it. It\u2019s a big market, but maybe not quite as huge in the short-term as maybe others have positioned it.","Alex Gauna","Okay. And then just to clarify on that, obviously you said it will take some time but from a convergence sense, is this one of those situations where the nature of the architectures and the workloads mean that for the foreseeable future we can think of it as a co-loaded \u2013 co-located FPGA and processing solution or are there clear benefits to convergence where we think about single die FPGA and CPU being really important in terms of accelerating that market?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, single die helps, but comes with the cost and the cost that you get typically is flexibility. The nature of these applications is they are very, very fragmented. And every one of them tends to have the different payload and actually, that payload is dynamic. So if you are using it to accelerate some sort of algorithm, the algorithm that you are accelerating changes all the time. And so if you do too much integration and you tend to have a very inflexible solution, you might end up losing, right. So when we talk to the customers and these tend to be a different class of companies, their \u2013 and their approach is they want to retain as much controls over their acceleration path and they would rather not give that to anyone else. And if you look at the way their approach has been, typically they do not buy from the traditional server companies. They actually build their own and they try to come up with a very specific solution, which is the most valuable for them. So there is a case to be made for integration, but what you lose when you do the integration is a lot of the flexibility, which is inherently important for this market. And so I would say it\u2019s great. In some cases it might go towards integration and others actually having a separate solution and being able to maintain the flexibility there is a huge benefit.","Alex Gauna","Alright, that\u2019s great. Thanks so much. One more quick point of clarification, you mentioned seeing and it\u2019s intuitive maybe a little bit of pauses as Nokia and Alcatel try to combine operations, is that factored into your upcoming quarterly guidance or would that pause be further out and would it be a few percent or would it be a fraction of a percent? What kind of exposure would we talk about to a potential slowing there or pause?","Jon Olson","We have not seen a pause as a result of whatever has been in the newspaper and their stated position on this. Moshe was only I think talking in general about when two companies get together what can happen in terms of how their organizations melt altogether. At this point in time, as best as we can tell, this is not going to be consummated at the earliest later this calendar year maybe in next calendar year. We are not seeing any sort of pause with our business with either company at this point in time.","Alex Gauna","Okay, thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suji De Silva from Topeka Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Suji De Silva","Hi, guys. So, I think I heard you guys saying you were trying to beef up the direct sales effort versus the key reps. I am curious which end markets do you feel like that\u2019s most important for, if any? And if it is the datacenter and try and target the cloud guys, is that somewhere you feel like you have to catch up versus competition or is that purchased \u2013 I mean, is that the wrong weight on this?","Moshe Gavrielov","We have now restructured our sales force to be tiered with two direct elements and the third element, which goes through this deep. We are managing that a little more closely than we have before. With the largest accounts primarily in communications and datacenter, we believe that we would benefit from a more direct interaction, because fundamentally, several of engagement needs to be deeper than it was before. And are we doing this later than ideally we should have? We probably are. In retrospect, this would probably have benefited from making this transition a year or two ago.","Jon Olson","Yes, I think also I mean it\u2019s just not \u2013 this is only focused at one end market. There is going to be some transitions going on even in our aerospace and defense market coverage to more direct sales. And I know some of these kinds of wins don\u2019t turn into immediate revenue. They are slower, but it does have both industrial, aerospace and defense, test and measurement as well as the communication segments impacted. And we \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a net positive for us.","Suji De Silva","Okay, great. That explanation helps. And then also I know the China LTE carrier pause question has been asked a lot. But I just want to ask one out of the way, anecdotally, what are your customers and your customers telling you about why this group of buyers is pausing at this juncture. Is it macro, is it concerns about LTE sub-brand or is it technical reasons in terms of cloud ran architecture feature? What do you think anecdotally?","Jon Olson","As best as we can tell, this is more about a CapEx China macro. I mean, I don\u2019t want to say macro, but China macro-related CapEx spend in the pace that they are getting funded internally to do things. And I don\u2019t know what else. Some of it there is always the politics between the FD standard and the TD standard and it\u2019s hard to tell whether that\u2019s still causing delays in FD as a result of TD being \u2013 trying to be in China Mobile trying to be more dominant, but I don\u2019t know that I am qualified to comment on whether how much of that is true or not.","Suji De Silva","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your last question comes from Earl Hege from Nomura. Your line is open.","Earl Hege","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I am calling for Romit Shah. I guess, when we look at your gross margin, you guys are maintaining the guidance there. How do we look at the volatility of that moving through the year as China LTE improves as you expect?","Jon Olson","Well, definitely in China \u2013 the wireless business, because of the volume and concentration of customers tends to have a drag on our gross margin. So, we would expect and we have modeled this that the second half would be lower than the first half as a result of that. I am not going to get into the real specifics, but the second half will be lower than the first half, but we are still confident in delivering our stated goal from Investor Day.","Earl Hege","Alright, great. And just a quick follow-up, just regarding your guys\u2019 own appetite for acquisitions, where do you stand in terms of looking at opportunities to strengthen and\/or diversify your business currently?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, this is a topic which is very sensitive. We have the capacity. You can tell by our track record that we do this very, very cautiously. The nature of our business is such that it has a unique element to it. So doing acquisitions for acquisitions sake is not trivial for us. And so the answer is we can do it. We know how to do it. At this point, if you look at where we are and what we have done, it\u2019s primarily been technology acquisitions as opposed to acquiring other companies that have a totally different business model and modus operandi.","Rick Muscha","Okay.

My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to Xilinx First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I would now like to turn the call over to Matt Poirier. Thank you. Mr. Poirier, you may begin your conference","Matt Poirier - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Catherine, and good afternoon, everyone. With me are Victor Peng, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter, the business outlook for the September quarter and the revised outlook for fiscal year 2019. We will then open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Beginning in Q2, in addition to GAAP financial measures, we expect to disclose certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the company's financial result. These measures are disclosed to facilitate period-to-period comparability for purposes of evaluating continuing business operation, by excluding the effects of non-recurring and unusual items, such as amortization of intangibles and certain one-time items related to acquisitions. As inorganic growth becomes more significant to our overall strategy, we believe that sharing these non-GAAP measures will be helpful for analysts and investors in analyzing the company's ongoing core business. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial information to the closest GAAP measure is included in our earnings release and has been posted on our Investor Relations website.","This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Victor.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone.","I'm delighted that our effort to drive growth in our core markets has delivered record revenue and EPS for the quarter. The June quarter revenues of $684 million were up 14% year over year, with growth across the majority of our business as six of our nine end markets increased in the quarter.","Our strategy to drive accelerated top line growth is delivering results. We're confident we can build on the momentum we established in Q1 through the rest of the fiscal year. Consequently, we are raising our guidance for the full year based on the strength of our business across multiple end markets, including the Data Center and TME market and the communications market. Lorenzo will discuss both the fiscal second quarter and the full year guidance in his remarks.","We made significant progress on our Data Center strategy, getting key design wins from hyperscalers in acceleration use cases beyond FPGA as a Service or FAAS. On the FAAS front, Huawei announced general access to their FAAS offering. We also continued the expansion of our software ecosystem with an additional 500 AWS F1 developers trained in the quarter, bringing the cumulative number of trained developers to over 900.","On the inorganic front, we acquired DeePhi Tech, which significantly strengthens our capability in artificial intelligence from the cloud to the edge. DeePhi is a Beijing-based company with industry-leading capabilities in AI, specializing in compression, pruning and system-level optimizations of deep neural network. We also made multiple investments during the quarter in our applications ecosystem across a breadth of apps, including data analytics, video transcoding, and network intelligence.","Lastly, on the Data Center, we see very strong early interest in the Data Center boards offering we plan to launch later this year, as we shared at our Analyst Day in May. Our transformation from an FPGA company to a platform company, which began when we introduced the 28 nanometer Zynq family, continues to build momentum with our 16 nanometer Zynq MPSoC and, most recently, our disruptive 16 nanometer Zynq RFSoC products. Our first and second generation Zynq products achieved a new sales record in the June quarter, growing 76% from the year ago quarter, and now represents 17% of total sales. This growth was driven by a broad set of applications in the automotive, industrial, communications, and Data Center markets. We're extremely excited about our RFSoC products that are now shipping in production and have very strong design-in momentum with approximately 60 active customers.","An example of our momentum in the automotive market is our recent announcement with Daimler AG of our collaboration on a custom AI inference platform for their future vehicles. This custom solution is built on top of a Xilinx automotive platform consisting of MPSoC devices, AI acceleration, IP and software. This scalable solution delivers high performance with low latency, and exceptional power efficiency for automotive applications with embedded AI. The partnership is going extremely well and is another milestone in our long history in the automotive business. We have cumulatively shipped more than 50 million units of ADAS into the automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers.","Our sustained excellence in innovation and execution is driving momentum across multiple end markets, as demonstrated in our June results. We're also delighted that a constructive resolution to the Department of Commerce ruling on ZTE has been reached. Accordingly, we plan to resume shipments to ZTE this quarter. Lorenzo will share more details on how this factors into the September quarter as well as our full year guidance.","While we're very pleased with our latest results, we remain intensely focused on executing on the three elements of our strategy; driving significant growth in the Data Center, accelerating growth in our core end markets, and driving adaptive computing. We are absolutely committed to the sustained long-term growth of our business and delivering value to the shareholders. Now, I'll turn it over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Victor.","As Victor discussed, our business is showing robust strength. So, today, I will discuss the first quarter, and I am pleased to also provide updated guidance for the rest of the year.","For the June quarter, sales increased to a record of $684 million as we easily surpassed the midpoint of our guidance. Sales were up 7% sequentially, and 14% year-over-year, driven by broad-based growth in our Advanced Products. Advanced Products grew 6% sequentially, and 21% year-over-year, indicative of the overall strength of our product portfolio. As a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard in the fiscal first quarter, and all figures and prior period comparisons are based on the new standard.","From an end market perspective, Data Center and TME was down primarily due to an expected decline in TME and the decline in cryptocurrency. Communications was up, as broader strength in both wired and wireless offset the impact of ZTE. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense grew slightly, as broad industrial growth more than offset an expected decline in A&D. Finally, all end markets in Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer increased. Channel revenue was $8 million. Note, we remain significantly below target levels of Channel inventory.","Gross margin for the quarter was 69.8%, in line with our guidance. Operating expense was $262 million, slightly higher than our guidance. Operating income for the quarter was $216 million, or 31.5%. The tax rate for the quarter was 11%, in line with expectations. Our net income for Q1 was $190 million, and diluted shares for the quarter were 256 million shares. That leads to earnings per share of $0.74, which is a record for Xilinx.","Now, I'd like to highlight a few key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in gross cash, and $1.7 billion net cash after our debt. In the quarter, operating cash flow was $176 million, and we returned $228 million to shareholders in the form of $91 million in dividends, and $137 million of share repurchases. We bought back approximately 2.1 million shares at an average price of $66.27 per share. We have approximately $570 million remaining in repurchase authorizations. We will continue to apply our capital allocation strategy, as discussed at our Analyst Day.","Accounts receivable increased $75 million to $456 million. While we expected receivables to decline this quarter, we are still in the process of implementing our new channel inventory management practices. The combination of shipment patterns and our business processes resulted in our increased accounts receivable balance. However, there is no concern about the quality of our accounts receivable. The receivables are current, and we anticipate no collection issues. We continue to improve our processes in conjunction with our channel partners, and are confident that we will see a reduction in the balance.","Now, for the guidance. As Victor mentioned, we are updating our FY 2019 guidance based on the broad strength we are seeing in our business. We now expect fiscal 2019 sales to be between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. This would be approximately 15% revenue growth at the midpoint. All of our end markets are expected to grow in the year, with notable strength coming from Data Center, TME, Industrial, and Communications.","We continue to gain revenue traction in Data Center. TME applications and customer adoption are expanding. And Industrial is growing across a broad set of applications, including industrial IOT, vision, and medical.","Wireless is expected to grow significantly with early 5G production deployments and the anticipated recovery of our business with ZTE. We are also seeing an increase in wired infrastructure deployment in conjunction with the 5G ramp. Gross margin is expected to be between 68.5% and 70.5%. GAAP operating expense is expected to be in the range of $1.147 billion to $1.167 billion. For the DeePhi acquisition, our preliminary estimate is approximately $27 million in amortization of acquired intangibles and other non-recurring expenses. Excluding those expenses, non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be between $1.120 billion and $1.140 billion.","GAAP other income is expected to be in the range of $18 million to $23 million. Excluding an expected gain on an investment of $8 million in Q2, non-GAAP other income is expected to be between $10 million and $15 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 10% and 14%. Fully diluted share count is expected to be approximately $256 million (sic) [256 million] (12:37) for the year.","Now, more near-term on the September quarter. We are expecting sales to be between $700 million and $720 million. With regards to primary end markets, we expect Data Center and TME to increase, with both end markets growing significantly. Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer is expected to be approximately flat, coming off a record quarter in June. Industrial, Aerospace & Defense is expected to decline, also coming off a very strong June quarter. Communications is expected to increase, with strong wireless revenue more than offsetting a slight decline in wired. We will benefit from early 5G deployment activity in Korea, as well as from the lifting of the denial order on ZTE. Channel revenue is expected to be approximately $20 million as we work toward more typical levels of channel inventory.","Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 69.5%. GAAP operating expense is expected to be $281 million, and non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be approximately $279 million. This excludes a preliminary estimate of approximately $2 million in amortization of acquired intangibles and other non-recurring expenses. Outside of the acquisition-related expenses, the primary factor driving the increase is employee compensation, including our regular annual compensation increase for employees, and profit sharing driven by our revenue growth. GAAP other income is expected to be approximately $11 million, primarily due to a gain on investment of $8 million. Excluding that gain, we expect non-GAAP other income of $3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 10% and 14%.","Finally, we have provided, on our website, revenue data which reconciles between our prior reported revenue and revenue under the new accounting standard, as well as a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for our Q2 and FY 2019 updated guidance.","With that, let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you so much. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about DeePhi, both from the perspective of what they bring you. I've actually met with the company a while back, but the fact that you own it, that you have it in-house, how is that going to be important? And then can you put that in the broader context of when you've talked about inorganic growth, is this the type of thing you're looking at, or would you sort of look for more revenue types of opportunity there that are more immediate? Thank you.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. Joe, DeePhi, as you probably know since you'd spoken to them, they've been using our platforms since the beginning, and achieving excellent results, (16:06) using their technology. They've grown quite a bit and they have expertise, of course, primarily in the DNN. But also, they got really good expertise in a variety of disciplines, the tools, the compilers, everything.","So, it really does segue into the second part of your question, match very well, clearly, I think, with our strategy. Not only because we had applied, of course, all of this technology in the cloud, but as you probably noticed, they actually have a good presence at the edge applications, many different camera applications. And we've already done a fair amount of joint marketing together with them with some of our customers. They've also got, as you'd imagine, good connections and opportunities in China, but we've worked with them very significantly with multinational companies and various different industries, Data Centers, as well as things like automotive. So, it matches really well, and it's a good example. I know people have been asking questions around what our thoughts are on our M&A, and I think this is a good example of how we believe, which we said, right, in the Analyst Day, that anything we would do would have a really strong connection to our stated strategy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Lorenzo, I'm wondering if you could just give us a little bit more detail in the increase in the fiscal year revenue guidance. It's about $100 million increase. I'm kind of curious, I apologize I've missed this, but the re-addition of ZTE, how much of that is in the $100 million? How do we think about, kind of, you working through your ASC 606 strategy? And how much of the increase is just the organic business being better? And to that third bucket, what would be the main drivers of just the organic business getting better? Thank you.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Right. So, I think I want to start with the strength in the broader organic business, because they would be overly simplified to say the increase in our annual guide is due to ZTE, because it's not. So, as Victor and I both said, we see strength across the Data Center opportunities, the Industrial area, Test Measurement and Emulation, and Communications in general, both wired and wireless, as we see new market opportunities come to us with the early emergence of some 5G deployments.","So, there is broader strength than just ZTE. And it's quite significant. The $100 million increase has nothing really to do with the channel strategy. That \u2013 our expectations for that were embedded in our previous guide.","Victor, do you want to add anything to that?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","I mean, everything that Lorenzo said is true. I mean, we \u2013 ZTE is a factor, but you shouldn't read into it. It's just ZTE coming in. As we said, if you even look at the quarter we just ended, wireless was stronger than we thought, and that was without ZTE. So, yes, this is pretty broad, which is part of the reason why I have such good confidence in wanting to raise the overall outlook.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to the Data Center side, and specifically, I just wanted to make sure I understood that part correct. Victor, you mentioned that you're getting early indications of interest on the board side. So, could you just expand a little bit more on that, because from what I understand you're actually going to \u2013 at least to us, you will unveil the product at your Developer Forum.","And also, what do these metrics mean when you talk about the number of developers that you are training on AWS? Thank you. Just provide a perspective for us, please. Thanks.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Sure. Look, as we shared in the Analyst Day, we are going to sell industry standard boards into the Data Center, because it's a very standards-driven form factor, and we see that as a win-win because, of course, we add more value to the customers on our solution. We also speed their ability to get their key IP and differentiation out on the market without having to deal with a lot of the basic system level issues that will build into the board.","Our internal projections on when that might be, perhaps we will conservative, because it's new territory for us; and what we're just getting is, in the early engagements with customers, quite a strong amount of interest. And our sales team is pretty excited. So, we do expect that will probably come out a little bit stronger than our internal expectations which, to be honest, is relatively modest since we're just getting into it. So, that's one aspect of it.","I think the other aspect of what does it mean about increasing developers and the investments we made in the applications ecosystem and then, for that matter, the DeePhi acquisition, I mean, we've said all along that while we're seeing good percentage growth in the core Data Center business, it's starting from a small base. So, this year, it's really all about, right, building on the foundation, driving the ecosystem, driving broader understanding, adoption, as well as the development we're working together with us as well as our FAAS partnerships to lower the barrier for use, improving the ease of use. Next year, we definitely think this is going to roll up into more material revenue, and continue the growth path that we do see.","So, what you should take away with these other metrics is that we don't want to emphasize the revenue in this year because we are building up that foundation. Again, frankly, on a percentage basis, it's a good sized percentage, but it's starting from a small base. So, what we're trying to share with you \u2013 we got a lot of feedback we're trying to share with you \u2013 other metrics for progress that we're getting, right? So \u2013 and I certainly do think it's meaningful, right, because once these developers are trained on the platform, then over time, you'll see a whole lot more innovation going on on our platform.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize ahead if this is a stupid question. I'm just trying to understand the Channel line you've inserted here. So, you talked about it increasing next quarter, and obviously it's with the change with ASC 606. But how do you think about it by segment? I guess I'm trying to understand this new reporting structure.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","No, I think that's a fair question, Blayne. I would answer part of your question directly, which is the reason we call it Channel is because the attribution to other end markets would be purely an estimate. And so we thought, for the purposes of transparency, we'd call it Channel.","The other part of it, and on the broader and longer term perspective, we think our Channel partners are very important for us to drive growth across all of our end markets. And we know that their ability to support their customers is dependent upon their ability to service them. And so you would see the general trend of that grow with the overall business. It will be maybe a little bit up and down, but in general, it will trend with the business.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Helpful. And then, maybe just another quick one on DeePhi. Just curious of that fiscal year guide, if you can break out what contribution from that acquisition.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","From a revenue perspective, I mean, they don't have any material revenue. So, I don't think that has anything to do with it. It does position us very well for FY 2020 and beyond. We're getting excellent \u2013 even before when we're separate \u2013 again, as we said, we did some co-marketing with a number of customers, and the technology really, really gets attention. So, we absolutely do see this being \u2013 bolstering our business, but for the current quarter \u2013 I mean, excuse me \u2013 fiscal year, we don't \u2013 there's no material add.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Victor, your Industrial, Aerospace & Defense business grew 30% year over year in the quarter. Could you perhaps highlight some of the key drivers there and talk a little bit about sustainability for the remainder of the fiscal year there? Thank you.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. I think the thing about that segment is it's very, very broad. Even if we looked at each sub-segment, like the Industrial piece, the A&D piece, it's very broad. So, I would say, one kind of common trend again, and I \u2013 we kind of rolled this up, is we're seeing such a good strength in Zynq-based products and people moving to platforms. Nobody's doing custom point solutions. They all want to build things that they could scale across their product line. There \u2013 some of these areas aren't extremely fast moving, but they really now, after going through the first-generation Zynq, we're seeing that ramp up and we're seeing a lot of design wins and a faster adoption on the second generation with the MPSoC.","I think in the Aerospace & Defense area, it's also good to see they are beginning to adopt more advanced technology on a more rapid basis. And I know I've talked to a number of both \u2013 and officials in the services, as well as, of course, their supply chain, our direct customers, and it's pretty consistent of them wanting to have shorter development cycles, adopt much of the latest technologies. So, that's all good.","I think MPSoC is clear again on the platform, but RFSoC also has \u2013 and we're in the early stages of that, but we really do see that being a very, very disruptive product, right? I think it will be at the same kind of level of change over time, right, as the original first Zynq. So, really advanced ADC, and WAF technology integrated into very bleeding edge digital has got incredible excitement in the customers, so.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. So, I would add on that the growth in this business is very strong, as Victor said, based on a broad set of applications in Industrial, as well as a broadening of applications in Aerospace & Defense. A little bit of cautionary aspect to it would be some of the A&D business can be lumpy. It can come in big chunks, and so any quarter to quarter comparisons, you have to probably normalize for a longer term trend. But in the long-term, it's going to be very, very good business for us.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. So, to more directly answer the last part of your question, it's definitely sustainable although, as Lorenzo points out, quarter to quarter you might see some dips. Like last quarter was extremely strong, this quarter will be slightly down. Overall the integrated view is it's up and sustained.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. I guess the question on Comms, you guided that business, I think, down 7% year on year for fiscal 2019, but I believe you said earlier that all segments would be up now. And so, I'm just curious, are you suggesting now that's roughly flattish-plus, so $60 million of the $100 million is coming from \u2013 so, I guess, as part of that, could you help us understand what contribution you expect from ZTE? And then you've mentioned a few times on the call, early 5G. Can you walk through kind of the early signs of the strength you're seeing there and how you're thinking about the flow through of growth in fiscal 2019 and into fiscal 2020? Thanks.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. We actually expect now that Communications will be up, not just getting back to being flat. As we said a little while ago, some of it is ZTE, but you shouldn't take away that it's all ZTE. And on the 5G, yes, we are seeing some early real deployments in 5G, maybe a little bit ahead of what we had expected. We still believe that the bulk of this will happen around the 2020 timeframe, but yes, it does seem like there are going to be some deployments earlier than that. And we have both MPSoC technology, as well as some of our pure FPGAs, as well as RFSoC technology going into those production deployments. So, that's a contributor. As we said also, Data Center, although it's small, it absolutely is growing, so that is contributing.","So, it is broad market. It isn't just a single thing, certainly not singly just ZTE. So, we do see it turning from being a negative to a positive. And I guess what I'd say is that we don't share details about specific customer revenues. We had mentioned when the first thing \u2013 when this first broke out, the news around the denial order, that we don't have any 10% customers nor anybody who is really even close to that. Nevertheless, ZTE is an important customer, and now that we could resume shipment, that's contributing to that strength.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes, C.J., you've said correctly that we had guided it down, on the average 7%, at our Analyst Day. We now see it positive in the mid-single digits in Communications for both those end markets combined, and I won't repeat too much of what Victor said in terms of breadth, but it is significantly more than just our expectations for ZTE.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Guerra with Robert W. Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Still very high gross margin levels embedded in the guidance for the rest of the year, but still a little bit lower than the 70% to 71% that you had for the three quarters of fiscal 2018, and presumably, if you see strength in Communication and also a pickup in Data Center, those presumably would be higher margin products. So, could you give us maybe a little bit of details on the gross margin profile? Are you pursuing lower margin opportunities? Or if not, what are the type of end markets that basically bring us back to the gross margin level that you used to have a couple of years ago?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So \u2013 hey, Tristan. The observation that the guide is a little bit below where we ended up the second half of the year is correct, but I do think you have to put in perspective that the gross margin levels we attained as a company are really quite good, a result of the value we provide our customers, and how aggressively we're managing the cost side of it. So, we worked real hard. We think the 68.5% to 70.5%, I guess 71%, that we got at Analyst Day is quite strong performance in aggregate. It will move up and down, dependent on mix. But one of the premises you said, that particular Communications business is higher than average, you have to keep in mind we have a portfolio of customers and a portfolio of end markets, and the margin dynamics are very different with each of them. I wouldn't say we're passing up revenue growth opportunities with any sort of margin screen. We aggressively pursue all the business that we think we can get, so.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","So, on that last note, let me just comment here that wireless specifically is generally very competitive. And so I don't think if you look at Communications as a whole, including wireless communications, I think the statement that wireless communications tends to be very margin rich is not the appropriate characterization, frankly.","And on the Data Center side, it really depends. You have to remember that when we talk about Data Center, we have opportunities in compute, storage and networking. And depends on what the use case is, there are some good, healthy value that we can hold. In other cases, you have to compete for the business. So, yeah, I'd say that you have to be a little careful about historic, perhaps, margins versus where things are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Kellan Grenier - Nomura Instinet","Yeah. Hey, everyone. This is Kellan Grenier for Romit. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering, your CapEx number for the full year that you gave in May was $45 million to $50 million. It looks like we're about halfway there exiting this quarter. Is there any change to the full year spending plan and kind of the distribution over the next three periods?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","We might be a little up from that plan, but on the order of $10 million to $15 million, but nothing material. And it could be a little lumpy based on some of the \u2013 it's basically some building refresh projects we have going on. So, there's nothing significant.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. This is Billy, on behalf of Chris Danely. Can you talk about a little more detail about why the Data Center was down this quarter? How much of that was crypto versus the rest of it?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah, I'll talk about that. It was largely impacted by crypto. If you take out crypto, we actually grew. We grew high-single digits quarter to quarter and, I think, 40% year over year. So, very strong, again, but based on a small number. So, that was mainly crypto that took that segment down.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Matt Poirier - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and then we will open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you, Rick and good afternoon everyone. In the December quarter, Xilinx\u2019s sales were $586 million, up 1% sequentially and up 3% on a year-over-year basis. Our sales for the first three quarters of the fiscal year are up 6% compared to the same period of the prior year. Growth was driven by our advanced products, which increased 2% sequentially and reached a new record. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, advanced products have grown nearly 50% compared to the same period of the prior year. In the December quarter, sales from our 28-nanometer Zynq family, our 20-nanometer family and our 16-nanometer family also passed our targets and reached new records with Zynq approaching 10% of total sales. Total 28-nanometer was approximately flat overall.","From an end market perspective, the largest sequential gains during the quarter were driven by communications with Industrial and A&D up slightly and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive down. Profitability remained strong during the quarter as both gross margin and expenses were slightly better than guided. Gross margin in Q3 was 69.6%, slightly better than guided as we continue to benefit from our focus on operational efficiencies.","Operating expense was $244 million, $1 million lower than guided. Recall that the primary driver of the increase in our R&D investment from the prior quarter was for 16-nanometer tape-outs as we continue to accelerate our technology leadership and brought in our product portfolio. Moshe will discuss how this R&D investment is beginning to pay off. Operating income for the quarter was $163 million or 27.8%. Other income and expense was an expense of $392,000, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution. Our tax rate was 13% for the quarter, better than guided due to several small discrete items. Our net income for Q3 was $142 million or $0.52 per share.","Some key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in gross cash and $1.8 billion net cash after our debt. Accounts receivable ended the quarter up $113 million at $341 million. This relatively high level of receivables was caused by the pattern of shipments and collections in the quarter and we see no collectibility issues. Inventory was $206 million, up $9 million from the prior quarter and up $10 million from the same quarter a year ago.","Operating cash flow was $106 million and was impacted by accounts receivable, as I just discussed. We expect operating cash flow to improve significantly next quarter as we normalize accounts receivable. In the quarter, we paid $83 million in dividends and we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $214 million, an average price of $54.72. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we have returned $665 million to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. This is more than 100% of the operating cash we have generated over the same period.","We ended the quarter with diluted shares of 271 million, which included 16.9 million shares from the convertible. A further comment on the convertible. In December, we received conversion notices for $140 million of the $600 million convertible notes consistent with the term of the notes. These conversions will be settled this quarter. Our expectations based on the current range of share prices, is that this will reduce diluted shares by 2 million to 2.5 million. As we have discussed, capital allocation remains a top priority for the company. We continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and we will return capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases. We continue to execute the more deliberate approach to share repurchase I discussed last quarter with the intention of exhausting our $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.","As I turn to guidance, I would like to once again refresh the key points of our annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we said we expected revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 68% and 70%, and our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million. Our performance through the first three quarters of the year and our guidance for Q4 indicate that we are on track to the guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting. In the March quarter, we are expecting sales to increase to $590 million to $620 million, which would put at the center of the revenue guidance provided at our Analyst Meeting. Our backlog is up heading into the quarter and advanced products will continue to grow, delivering new records for sales of our 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer products. On end markets, we expect communications to be down slightly with declines from wireless offsetting growth from wired. Industrial and A&D is expected to increase with all three secondary markets, flat to up.","Lastly, Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive is expected to increase driven by a significant increase in advanced driver assistance systems. Our gross margin will be approximately 68% to 70%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position and we expect operating expense to be approximately flat at $244 million. Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Lorenzo. I am very pleased with the financial results of the third quarter. We delivered our fifth consecutive revenue growth quarter. Revenue reached its highest level in nearly 2 years while delivering better-than-expected profitability. We continue to benefit from our diversified, multi-market strategy and technology leadership portfolio. In the December quarter, wireless rebounded significantly, largely driven by 4G business in China and India as well as pre-5G deployment. Sales also increased in A&D and ISM, more than offsetting declines in other end markets.","Overall, revenue growth continues to be driven by our advanced products. For the first 9 months of fiscal year \u201817, advanced products were up nearly 50% versus the prior year period. We anticipate our advanced products will again grow significantly in the March quarter and set a new sales record. This momentum in our advanced products is fueling our confidence in meeting the midpoint \u2013 the revenue growth forecast 4% to 8% we provided at last year\u2019s Analyst Meeting.","Sales from our 28-nanometer Zynq product family, the industry\u2019s first All Programmable SoC, increased by nearly 20% led by growth in wireless communications and ADAS applications. Our overall 28-nanometer revenue, including Zynq, is expected to increase in the March quarter, set a new record driven by broad end market deployment. 20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level, significantly exceeding our $50 million target. We expect to ship over $60 million of 20-nanometer products in the March quarter, setting a new record. 60-nanometer sales grew significantly in the December quarter to a new record, exceeding our forecast while shipping to multiple end markets, including automotive, data center and communications. We expect 60-nanometer sales to increase again in the March quarter, set a record as broad based customer adoption continues to accelerate.","Our decision to increase our fiscal year 2017 R&D investment to both capitalize on our technology leadership and expand our product portfolio continues to pay off. After reaching critical production milestone that extended our 60-nanometer competitive lead to well over a year, we have accelerated our production tape-outs of this node and are currently shipping 12 unique products to over 300 active customers. We announced the expansion of our 60-nanometer portfolio with devices that integrate high bandwidth memory and CCIX technology. This product family is architected to support performance intensive applications, such as compute acceleration in the data center, high data rate, Ethernet connectivity, 8K video and radar systems. Last quarter, these expanded R&D investments helped us to further develop the market potential for data center acceleration. Xilinx introduced the reconfigurable acceleration stack with a goal to enable mainstream adoption of our FPGAs for accelerated machine learning, video transcoding and big data analytics. Amazon Web Services recently announced they are deploying our 60-nanometer UltraScale+ FPGAs in the cloud. This has the potential to create a new disruptive business model for our technology and expand the reach to a very broad set of enterprise customers.","We continue to invest in data center market development, anticipating the longer-term horizon for revenue returns. The $590 million to $620 million sequential revenue guidance driven from significant growth in our advanced products will manifest itself in many of our end markets, including wired communications, data center, automotive, ISM, A&D, consumer and broadcast. This broad based growth underscores the strength of our diversified, multi-market portfolio.","We now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joe Moore","Great. Thank you so much. I had a question on the broadcast, consumer and auto being down sequentially quite a bit and I guess the ADAS business within that is obviously doing very well, can you just kind of put in context kind of what are the puts and takes in that business and is there something anomalous about the decline that you saw in the December quarter?","Lorenzo Flores","So I don\u2019t think there is anything anomalous in the decline, Joe. I think the issues we had, some inventory positioning on the part of some of our key customers in ADAS. We still see strength in all of the design wins that we have talked about and all the \u2013 on all of the end markets \u2013 I am sorry, end manufacturer models that we have talked about before, so we don\u2019t have any concerns over that. And as Moshe described, we expect to see a very strong rebound in automotive driven by ADAS in the fourth quarter. A large part of the decline, as we have been talking about before, has been in the infotainment business as well. So we are not concerned.","Joe Moore","Okay, great. Thank you. And I guess maybe following-up just on that business, can you talk about \u2013 there is infotainment headwinds, are there other headwinds to understand and when you have talked about pretty strong growth in ADAS, should we see that result in much higher revenue growth in this segment in the next 12 months or are there offsets to that?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, if you go back 1 year or 2 years, infotainment was by far the largest portion of the business. And over the last 2 years, ADAS has grown and infotainment has shrunk. Now, ADAS is by far the largest portion of the business and it generally speaking, continues to grow at a faster rate. So we expect our automotive business to be one of the growth drivers over the next year for sure and see overall growth in automotive in fiscal year 2018 versus fiscal year 2017.","Lorenzo Flores","I think we have discussed before Joe that the breadth of our design wins and we are at a point where it\u2019s the take rate of the option packages that will help determine the growth of our business there.","Joe Moore","Okay. Thanks so much.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Thank you. Moshe, I had a question on OpEx and really not looking for the guide, but really the framework of how should we think about what are you and Lorenzo looking at as we look at the next fiscal year, because last year you negatively surprised everybody, but then you articulated why you are doing it and then since then you have kind of shown to us why and you gave some good metrics today. So how should we think about how you are thinking about what you and Lorenzo are looking at over the next quarter or two quarters. And then my quick follow-up for you Lorenzo, accounts receivable are up a lot and you said it should normalize back in the quarter, did I get that correct that there will be a big delta on a positive side for CFO?","Lorenzo Flores","Thanks. So the quick answer is yes. And I will let Moshe answer the bigger picture framework question and I will probably add in at some point.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So we will be giving guidance for next year, some initial guidance at the next earnings release and obviously full guidance in May when we have our Investor\/Analyst Day in New York City. But generally speaking, if you look at what we had committed to do, we had said that we are investing. We are investing to exploit the technology lead we have and it would be foolish not to do that both in the short-term and definitely in the medium-term and long-term. Having said that, we are committed to getting back to the 30%, right. So what you will hear in the next earnings release and in May, you will hear more details with regards to that, but we should be moving back in that direction generally speaking. And how quickly we will get there, it\u2019s too early for me to give you any clear guidance on that, but that direction we are committed to regardless.","Lorenzo Flores","Yes. So actually, I don\u2019t have much to add to that Ambrish, but I think I will expand a little bit on accounts receivable because I am sure other people may have the same question. If you look back, we have had an occasional spike of accounts receivable and you probably generally followed up with the quarter where they come down and we obviously collect the cash. Obviously, we are trying to manage this, but most importantly, when we service our customers, when they want the product. And so that impacts when we can collect for the revenue that we have. So and looked it very closely, we don\u2019t see any issues, as I have said earlier, on collecting the accounts receivable. So we expect to turn that back down to a more normal level in this quarter.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. Thanks for the clarity.","Moshe Gavrielov","Next question please.","Operator","Your next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse","Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess, one question, two parts, so as you think about 60-nanometer, your share gains there and the acceleration that you are seeing there with your customer base, I am curious on two fronts, one, when do you think we could get upwards of $100 million or so incremental revenues either on a run rate basis or overall across ADAS and data center. And then secondly, now that you have put all the spending on the OpEx side in fiscal \u201816 \u2013 fiscal \u201817, sorry, how should we think about OpEx trajectory into fiscal \u201818? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Let me do \u2013 I will try to answer your first part of your question probably a little differently than the way you had asked it. Just to remind you, we \u2013 typically takes a very long period of time from when we introduce the technology to when it actually provides huge revenue. And an example would be 28- nanometer, which is still not at its peak and we actually think that it\u2019s a minimum of 2 years, maybe even further away from its peak. Now, if you look at 20 and 16 together, we tend to look at them as one node just due to the way they were introduced. They came relatively close together. And the combination of those \u2013 these two nodes is doing very well across all markets. 16, it\u2019s still early days. We have these 300 customers and 12 unique devices that are shipping, but none of the customers are yet in volume production. You are right in highlighting that 16, two of the markets that will unquestionably drive that are automotive and data center. They are not the only two markets. They actually had much broader applicability. And of the two \u2013 those two data center tends to happen a little faster than automotive, but data center for us is a nascent market. It\u2019s very early in its development and that\u2019s why we are very careful in highlighting that the investments we are making in data center now will likely pay off a few years down the road, and we sort of highlighted 2020 is when it will be substantial in the potentially hundreds of millions of dollars. So to answer on 16-nanometer, overall, I would be disappointed in 2 years if it isn\u2019t well over $100 million worth of business. Which markets will constitute that $100 million of sales, it\u2019s still early to tell. And for this year, it will be significant, but it won\u2019t be at that $100 million for this fiscal year for sure.","Lorenzo Flores","And the other part with the OpEx trajectory?","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure.","Lorenzo Flores","Okay. So C.J., I think I\u2019ll just echo a little bit of what Moshe said in response to Ambrish\u2019s question, which is we will obviously provide more details coming out of our fiscal year and at our Analyst Day. But I think that what we said in the past is what we are thinking now, which is we don\u2019t expect the slope of the R&D investment to be at the same angle as this past year and we are managing the company to get back to the 30% up and greater operating margin level in the intermediate term, if you will.","C.J. Muse","Very helpful. Thanks so much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra","Hi, good afternoon. Could you provide an update, if you could in terms of the timing for the next geometry node initial ramp? And also, what type of product should we expect, will it be all very high end or stacked architecture or will you be targeting mid-range as well with that new node?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Well, it\u2019s the risk of quoting our President it\u2019s going to be phenomenal. But back on the serious note, we are very excited about the 7-nanometer. We are delighted that TSMC continue to provide leadership product. We definitely benefit from the fact that they now have caught up and providing leadership technology at the earliest point in time. We expect our 2018 to be the year that we tape-out and provide first silicon. It will be \u2013 and this is where the phenomenal ends it stripes, it will be a very broad product offering, it won\u2019t be just the high-end product offering and we believe we have \u2013 we will have the engineering innovation that enables us to cover most of the market, definitely not the low end with the 7- nanometer technology. So, it will be a very broad technology, applicability and we will have very significant impact on numerous of the markets we service. It will likely not at least initially have a low end footprint just because when you get to those new advanced nodes, they tend to be a lot more expensive, both in terms of mask sets and in terms of wafer costs and it takes time to get that to the point where you can actually address a low end portfolio. So, what we have done to address the low end portfolio in the interim is expanding 28-nanometer, which is a much more cost-sensitive and mature node to address that market, so we can protect and actually expand our position at the low end, because we feel that the low end has been relatively underserved, and it\u2019s an opportunity for us. Hence, the additional investment we are making at 28-nanometer at the low end.","Tristan Gerra","Great, thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure, thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Smigie from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steve Smigie","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate my questions. My first question was a little bit on the competitive front, you saw Intel\/Altera product there, 14-nanometer part. And I am just curious now it\u2019s a little bit into that what we have actually seen from customers, does it matter or are you guys already so far ahead since you are a year out that it will take a while to even really get manage lion\u2019s share of customers?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, we never underestimate our competition, least of all, Intel in that regard. But having said that, they are doing extremely well at 16-nanometer. The product is very mature. The yields are exceptional. The functionality of the product is great. That\u2019s why we are investing in getting the production mask sets with very fine tweaks to solve the teething issues that the product had at the very beginning. And it\u2019s doing really, really well. So our competitive position, we feel is incredibly strong at this node just due to the maturity of the product and the breadth of the family and the quality of the design and the operations at this point. So, it\u2019s going really well. And we obviously are intent on continuing to exploit this lead and we assume there will be competition, but we are moving forward as quickly as possible to enhance and consolidate our position and it\u2019s working quite well for us.","Steve Smigie","Great, thanks. And just as my follow-up, you have had quite a bit of success with Zynq with good growth rates there. Now, it\u2019s been out there for a little while. Can you talk about what the growth trajectory over the next year or two might look like at this point?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, it\u2019s \u2013 Zynq was the groundbreaking new product for us and it was introduced relatively late in the 28-nanometer cycled product introduction, it was about a year after the initial device is. It was targeted at three markets, wireless, automotive and industrial. What has happened is because it is a really a system-level solution, because it has a very powerful CPU system embedded inside it, and that\u2019s the first time something of this sort was available. It took a little longer for those designs to move into production. But what has happened now is that they are moving into production. Wireless and automotive are further ahead. The big ramp in industrial is still ahead of us. We have a mountain of design wins, which are now moving into production. And if you look at 16-nanometer, we are already seeing very fast adoption of the follow-on MPSoC device, which is going to market much faster than the initial generation was. So this is a significant portion of our business, because it started from zero and was competing with over $2 billion of other markets. It\u2019s of other technologies. It took time, but it\u2019s already at 10%, and we expected of our overall revenue and we expect it to be a very significant portion and a growing portion of the revenue with each subsequent node that we come up with. And it fundamentally moves us to a different role in our customer systems. And we are now competing against ASSP quite successfully in a broad range of markets. And if you look at our automotive business, our position in ADAS is very different from our position in infotainment. In infotainment, we were a companion device. In ADAS, we are the central device in the system. And that transition that we have made into the hearts of our customer systems is continuing at a fast rate. And Zynq is \u2013 in the 60-nanometer version and definitely the 7-nanometer version, which will be even more powerful and capable will enable us to do that in more and more of the markets we serve.","Steve Smigie","Okay. Thank you very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you. Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Thanks for letting me asking you question. I just want to go back a little bit to the December quarter and could you explain a bit more about what broadcast consumer did, you mentioned that auto was down from an inventory digest and that\u2019s understandable, but it seems like between what you delivered in December quarter in that entire segment and what you are guiding for March, it \u2013 there must have been a pretty steep decline in auto and then a pretty big snapback implied in your guidance, is there any color you can give on that, please?","Lorenzo Flores","Yes. So Ross, the other end markets in that group were also down a little. And you are right, our guidance for next quarter assumes \u2013 we really are expecting a significant snapback from automotive.","Ross Seymore","Got it. Thanks for that color. And then I guess following up on the prior question about Zynq, Moshe. Conceptually, how do you look at that as far as being an incremental adder of revenue to the company versus something where there is some resemblance of a substitution effect and I guess the reason why I ask it that way is the 20% growth sequentially, the 25% going from very little to now 10% of your revenues, those are very impressive numbers, but if I look segment-by-segment where that Zynq product resides, those are not growing nearly as fast as what I would think if Zynq is growing in there, so is there are some offset to that we are not appreciating or any description on that dynamic would be helpful?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Well, generally speaking, if you look at our business, we tend to serve a lot of markets and those markets move at difference rates. And as a result, we typically have numerous \u2013 revenue from numerous technology nodes at the same time. So first order effect and this is before I talk about Zynq against vis-\u00e0-vis other non-Zynq technologies. So first order effect, you have older technologies that are shrinking and you have newer technologies that when we do well in those nodes and now we have three nodes in a row where we have done well, they tend to be growing. And what has happened over the past few years is it took time for the advanced nodes to get to the point where they could, even though we had well over our natural market share, but it took time for these advanced nodes to be able to compensate for the old nodes, which were shrinking. Now, if you sort of do the arithmetic, we are at 47% on the advanced nodes and 53% on what we call core technology. And so the growth \u2013 the accelerated growth in the core technology is generally compensating for and then some for the shrinkage in the old nodes. This trend of new node cannibalizing old nodes is just parts and parcel of the semiconductor industry. We are not very different than that. So every time we introduced a new node, it \u2013 to some extent, if all the customers need is the exact same device, but a little cheaper, they can achieve that by going to the new node and that cannibalizes. What sort has happened is over the years, we have provided a very significant integration play and this is where I am getting to answering your question, just in case you are wondering. This is where the integration enables us to capture a larger part of the customer\u2019s bill of material. And Zynq is part of that. And so if you look at the bill of materials now, we actually have the opportunity to replace ASSPs or standalone processors or standalone microcontrollers, at least in some of the markets, not all that we read. So yes, in that regard, Zynq is a market expansion play, but it very similar to the core business, it does tend to have some element of cannibalization. And that\u2019s why when you sort of look at the numbers, which we have projected, we are sort of on course to deliver the first of what our hopefully several 6% growth years, which we said was our goal last year. And we are pleased to have delivered on that. And part of it is through market expansion. And Zynq is a market expansion play. But it provides some market expansion, but you are right, it does cannibalize some of the revenue from the previous generation. And if you look at wireless as an example, which is a market, which we are now serving with Zynq, and before, we used to serve with what I would call advanced, but cleaner FPGAs, then yes, that\u2019s a market where we are cannibalizing the old revenue. But truthfully, if we didn\u2019t have the Zynq, we would not be playing in that market with these advanced nodes. So in some cases, it\u2019s an expansion. In some cases, you just need to move forward in order to standstill. And that\u2019s the name of the game is the semiconductors.","Ross Seymore","Thank you very much for that detail. It\u2019s very helpful.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely from Citi. Your line is open.","Philip Lee","Hi guys. This is Philip Lee on behalf of Chris. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I just want to dive a little deeper into the data center, the [indiscernible] opportunity there, how much revenue do you think you guys can do this year and how much of that is in new applications, such as hyper-scale or compute?","Moshe Gavrielov","So the numbers we have projected are potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in and around calendar 2020. And we are still at the early stages, right. So and that\u2019s why our choice of words has been consistently very careful in terms of setting expectations. Now what has happened is we are seeing tremendous pickup and tremendous interest in public design wins with Baidu and AWS position us to \u2013 as this market evolves and as it emerges to service it in a unique way. But it would be premature to assume that there is going to be a huge growth in terms of revenue in fiscal year \u201818, right. It\u2019s still too early. These deployments are new deployments. We are committed to supporting them extremely well to enable them over time to develop into significant business, but this is not fiscal year 2018 where it will make a significant dent in whatever number we commit to for this upcoming year. It\u2019s still a little further out than that.","Philip Lee","Thanks, Moshe. Very helpful. And as a follow-on can you talk about your end markets the relative growth you expect this year, do you see any of the segments going faster or slower relative to the other ones?","Moshe Gavrielov","We will provide more insight, significantly more insight into that in May. It\u2019s still premature, but no, we feel that the technology leadership and the broad market participation are playing in our favor. And sometimes we predict that market A will grow and actually, it\u2019s a market B that grows. And that\u2019s one of the benefits of the broad market participation that we have. So, we will give you more data in May.","Philip Lee","Okay, thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer","Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and congratulations on the good quarter. Lorenzo, maybe I can ask the OpEx question a different way. If you look at sort of the ramp of OpEx throughout the fiscal year, you\u2019ve got a much bigger spend in the second half of the year such that if you just kind of straight line the March quarter guide, OpEx would be up 5% year-on-year in fiscal \u201818. I am just kind of curious given sort of the pace of tape-outs, especially in the back half of the year, this fiscal year, is there actually opportunity to take OpEx absolute dollars down going forward or is the opportunity set such that it\u2019s really about sort of the slope of the ramp and the rate of growth?","Lorenzo Flores","Yes. So John, I certainly understand both why you asked the question and how you kind of framed it, but I will go back to something Moshe has said and we are going to try very hard to stick to over the next 3 months. We want to provide you a much clearer view of what our 2018, or FY 2018 looks like as we come out of this fiscal year and into our Analyst Day. But I will address a couple of your points may be to help you out in the interim. We do have, as you noted, significant increase in the second half of the year from tape-outs that we are taking advantage of our leadership position and we think it was the right thing to do. We told you we are going to do it at our last Analyst Day and as we are doing it. We are also growing our overall R&D capability. So, those are factors we are going to have to balance as well as what we are doing on the next nodes in the next fiscal year. And I think it\u2019s probably more beneficial to your understanding of our operating model next year to wait rather than try to guess at it right now.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And then Moshe maybe as my follow-up, notwithstanding your comments earlier about putting expectations around acceleration, just given what we are seeing going on in the GPU market right now and the uptake of GPU to the data center, given that it would seem that the FPGA architecture in a lot of instances for acceleration applications might actually be superior, what is it that that\u2019s allowing GPU uptick to be faster than FPGA uptake for these applications in the data center in the near term? Is it really a software stack issue or can you help me understand that?","Moshe Gavrielov","You are absolutely right. This was identified as a growth market by the GPU companies primarily NVIDIA, a long, long time ago and I give them credits for identifying that in their desire to diversify beyond their core PC and gaming focus, they invested very heavily on the software front. What we are doing is we are now taking a page out of their book. It\u2019s not necessarily the same page. It\u2019s a little bit of a different page. And we have to do that in order to enable broader deployment fundamentally, because the customer base \u2013 the target customer base is not FPGA savvy and it\u2019s very unlikely that they will become FPGA savvy. Hence, you need this higher level of abstraction. And so the core benefits in the silicon architecture are there and we are continuing to drive those in all of the current generations. Some of the customers have the capability to deliver on that by themselves. Some of them need quite a bit of help and we are providing that through things like this rest architecture solution, which should make it easier for them to access the technology. Now as that is done and then you can look at some unique deployments like the Amazon one is unique and that it\u2019s FPGA as a service, as we support that effort to enable them to expand the markets that could have a significant leverage with regards to the breadth of people who have access to it. That\u2019s why we are so excited. That\u2019s why we are getting some benefit from probably the biggest customer in the world and their business model and their approach to doing this. So that could, as it gets deployed and it\u2019s brought to the market successfully that could accelerate this entire process. So between that and the rest architecture, I think those are the things that we believe will enable us to get to market much faster. And it won\u2019t take us the same period of time, but it took other competitors in the past to develop this market.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","Great, thanks. Actually, I have a similar question to the last one, but maybe from a more generic perspective, you are highlighting this deployment at AWS. And as you just said software has been a big differentiator that\u2019s perhaps given NVIDIA some early traction there. But can you talk a little bit more generically about the architecture of FPGAs versus GPUs and then your architecture versus what Intel\/Altera has, and why you expect to capture more share of this market relative to both of those solutions?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So, let\u2019s step back. The market really is very, very nascent and the biggest player today is Intel through their CPU offering. And now a fast emerging player who has pretty significant deployments is NVIDIA with some of these hyperscale players. What has become very, very clear is as the market is evolving, it\u2019s also segmenting. And there are \u2013 it\u2019s becoming clearer what elements are served really well by NVIDIA, for example and what elements which sometimes overlap, but sometimes are totally different are better within all programmable solution. So in these early days, its first-mover advantage is significant. It does give a lead, but there are inherent advantages, which we believe we have. And Intel clearly recognized those and that was one of the major drivers as they publicly have stated for their acquiring Altera was to be able to address that market. So, there is a whole set of applications, which are learning-oriented where NVIDIA and GPUs have probably a better architectural fit, but most other applications, which are potentially larger, are better serviced by us and programmable logic.","Now with regards to the competition against Intel, it\u2019s again very early 30 days. We believe that, a), anything which is non-Intel related were going to be the obvious solution, right? And so there is not insignificant business, which potentially could be serviced by AMD on x86 by IBM with their power solution and by the host of ARM guys and that will fall very naturally into our lap for obvious reasons. Having said that, that\u2019s not the only market we can play in, because we think that even \u2013 and we are hearing this from the major players even where they are currently using Intel x86 processors when they are looking for an acceleration, they are finding that our leadership in terms of silicon technology and the approach with the pooled architecture where basically you could have a pool of Xilinx\u2019 FPGAs, which provide acceleration, is more attractive to them than the approach, which Intel pursues which is more likely to strengthen their CPU hegemony with the one CPU, one FPGA solution, right. And that\u2019s where we think that for a lot of these players, we \u2013 even if they end up using Intel x86, they are likely to want to pursue an acceleration solution, which is not dictated by Intel. And that\u2019s where we have the opportunity. All-in-all, we are very careful in terms of setting expectations. And hence, it\u2019s still early days. We expect to see hundreds of millions of dollars in the 2,000 \u2013 calendar 2000 [ph] timeframe. And if we do well and all of these other things work our way, potentially it could happen maybe faster or maybe larger, but it\u2019s too early to commit and we are very careful in terms of highlighting that.","William Stein","Great. If I can get one follow-up, please, in the ADAS market, the big sort of category that I am aware of is this sort of hovering view stitching together for a camera corner view in some orders, but I am suspecting maybe it\u2019s much more diverse and at the minimum, you might have some sensor fusion applications, could you comment on the diversity of the design wins and the pace of ramps in those ADAS application? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So you are right that this is emerging and it\u2019s emerging very, very quickly. And the needs are quite fluid and they are growing and there are different requirements. And so there is a broad set of design wins, which address different approaches. And sensor fusion is sort of a buzzword for highlighting that there is a whole family of different sensors that are required, some of which point forward, some of which point inward, some of which point sideways, some of which point backward. And this market is evolving at a very, very fast rate. What we are seeing is due to be uncertainty in the market and the \u2013 and due to the fact that for automotive, it\u2019s moving, it\u2019s an unprecedented upgrade [ph]. There is a lot of uncertainty, and that\u2019s where we believe we have tremendous benefit because our solutions tend to enable a lot of flexibility as the markets change. And we are seeing that the major benefit with regards to competition with other companies that have a more ASSP oriented rigid solution. And we are seeing just a broad range of these different approaches and the design wins actually fall into numerous categories for us that \u2013 and enable us to address a lot of these. The early mover advantage we had here is helping us, because we have the relationships and it\u2019s already approaching 10% of our business, which actually makes this one of the biggest players in this market. Just don\u2019t have the marketing budget to sort of spray that over the Super Bowl, but we are doing really well.","William Stein","Great. Thanks very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Charles on for Toshiya. Thanks for taking my question. Just going to head on the data center side again, such tremendous opportunity, but I was wondering, as you kind of size your opportunity in hundreds of millions of dollars out to 2018, 2020, what are kind of the share \u2013 what kind of share does that imply for you guys in the acceleration market and I was just wondering what your TAM assumptions might be. And then I had another one, in terms of displacing NVIDIA, just wondering if you have any sense of the hurdles, maybe from a performance standpoint or a power standpoint that you have to overcome given kind of your weight in the game on the software side?","Moshe Gavrielov","So the TAM is huge. The TAM today is \u2013 it has been growing maybe not as quite as quickly as it was before, but it has been growing and it\u2019s approaching $20 billion. And that\u2019s if you look mostly at the service side that primarily with x86 and the GPU side and that\u2019s sort of a market, which is already at that level now. That market is changing and it\u2019s changing to be serviced by more cost effective and power effective solutions and that\u2019s where we actually, for a broad range of applications can provide high performance, which we have demonstrated at a lower power point than competitive solutions, be they processors where the gap tends to be quite big and GPUs where the gap is somewhat smaller, but it\u2019s still substantial. And so if you look at the big market, you can say well, $20 billion market and we do not want to leave anyone with the impression that, that is all serviceable by Xilinx. However, I do believe that there is billions of dollars available to be addressed by alternate solution. And of that, we believe we can easily capture 10%. And if we do well, we can capture more than 10% of that over time. And the benefit will be higher performance to lower power point. And again for us, we have to accept the fact that we recognized this leg. And we now have to \u2013 we have the relationships with the sever hyper-scale guys. We have design wins with several of them in significant programs, but it\u2019s still going to take time for that to translate into massive deployments. And that\u2019s why we are providing these numbers, right in the hundreds and millions of dollars, which sort of correlate to the market share \u2013 potential market share of the serviceable market that I shared with you.","Unidentified Analyst","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, you had mentioned some revenue from pre-5G builds, I was wondering if your outlook kind of on the timing of 5G has changed at all and if so, what\u2019s kind of driving that? Thanks.","Moshe Gavrielov","So 5G originally because monetization of 4G took a little longer, there was an expectation that 5G would get pushed out about 2 years ago, maybe a little longer than that. It appeared that the tide had turned and there was a mad rush to provide 5G solutions. And we are benefiting from that because technology leadership has given us the full position with regards to this pre-5G deployment. Having said that, we think that the prime time for 5G is still likely in the 2020 timeframe and it\u2019s not going to be massive before that. If it is, we will be in a good position to address it. But we are looking at 2020 for the big wave of 5G deployments. And we think between now and then, there will be a lot of interim steps, which we are well positioned to service, but they are less likely to be true 5G. In terms of marketing statements, I am sure there will be a lot of ultra stating marketing statements, which will claim 5G and all of that, but we won\u2019t be \u2013 the real thing there will be a step in the direction.","Lorenzo Flores","Operator, we can take one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Rolland from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.","Chris Rolland","Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I am just thinking about India, perhaps that\u2019s the next area of infrastructure of growth and I know won\u2019t be as large as China, but also, we can understand that the equipment may not to be as heavily dependent on ASICs, so thinking in terms of actual FPGA content, what might India look like in revenue terms for you guys compared to China?","Lorenzo Flores","So we are actually pretty pleased with our position in India. We are benefiting right now \u2013 the strength in our wireless business, a significant portion of it comes from India-based deployments. So as that expands over time, we think we will continue to take advantage of it. But the outlook \u2013 specific outlook for the deployment is a little bit more murky, but as I said just a second ago, we are really well positioned with respect to our customers that have a position in India. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be of this scale in the near-term that the China-based deployments were and we also don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as rapid deployment has happened in China. We still think it\u2019s a good amount of business for us.","Chris Rolland","Great. Also, on the auto side of things, at CES I think there was at least one announcement from a large German Tier 1. I think they currently use Zynq that they will be switching to NVIDIA solutions. I think ADAS is a great market for you guys, has been Zynq it will continue to be, but what gives you guys confidence that we won\u2019t see ASIC replacement in ADAS as kind of market standards start to mature here?","Moshe Gavrielov","So I am not quite sure who you are referring to because we have a plethora of design wins and we also tend to have follow-on design wins with all of the current players and new ones. The market is evolving and it\u2019s changing quite rapidly. And there are people who have the strong position in infotainment who are trying and planning on playing in the market. It\u2019s \u2013 they are not coming at it from an ADAS-like approach, which tends to have a lot of distributed processing. They tend to have a approach, which is very, very super CPU or super GPU oriented with the central control. It\u2019s still too early to know which of these approaches will work. And what is happening is as the market is very fluid, the needs are fluid and the competition is very fluid and the automotive market is going through a huge transition in this regard probably in unprecedented transition. We actually believe that having been there early on ADAS and being involved in all of these next steps is very attractive for us. And that\u2019s why we believe that this will continue to drive our growth going forward. 10 years from now, it\u2019s quite possible that the market will be commoditized and there won\u2019t be the room for the changes and the uncertainty as to how the market will evolve. And at that point in time, it\u2019s quite possible that ASIC\/ASSPs will gain market share, but I think there is several years ahead of us of fluid market where the flexibility of our capabilities and the strength which a lot of the strength, which is inherent that we just talked about in data center is actually very germane to automotive, right. And that\u2019s where you will find a higher performance at a lower PowerPoint solution with the programmable logic element. So we are quite confident that we are \u2013 for the next several years, we are in a very good spot with regards to monetizing this market.","Chris Rolland","Yes, I agree. Great answer.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the December quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available, and that actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon A. Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $511.1 million in the December quarter, a decrease of 8% sequentially and 10% on a year-over-year basis. This was slightly better than the revised guidance we provided on December 19, due primarily to increased business from large communication customers in Asia-Pacific and North America during the last 2 weeks of the quarter.","Gross margin was 65.8%, up from 63.9% in the prior quarter and better than anticipated, driven primarily by favorable customer mix and continued overall cost reduction. Operating expenses were $199 million, flat with the prior quarter and a little less than guided, primarily due to lower variable expenses associated with lower revenue and increased attention to fiscal discipline. Operating margin was 26.8% for the quarter.","New product sales decreased 13% sequentially and increased 5% on a year-over-year basis. Virtex-6, Spartan-6 and our 28-nanometer product families all posted solid sales growth during the quarter. The new product category, however, was impacted by declines from our Virtex-5 customers in the wireless segment. Mainstream products declined 1% sequentially, and base products were flat. ","Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. In the face of a continued weak wireless demand environment, communication sales declined 10% sequentially, more than we were anticipating heading into the quarter. Wired communications, on the other hand, increased during the quarter with particular strength from enterprise networking. ","The industrial and other category was down, as expected, with sales decreasing 7% sequentially, driven by industrial, scientific and medical and test and measurement applications. Consumer and automotive sales were weaker than anticipated during the quarter, driven by declines from audio\/video broadcast, consumer and automotive applications. Data processing sales were approximately flat.","Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $7.2 million. Third quarter net income included a tax benefit of $15.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share related to one-time items, including the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain previously unrecognized tax positions.","Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $181 million before $19 million in CapEx. For the past 4 quarters, cash generation from operations was $863 million, a new company record. We paid $50 million in cash dividends and repurchased 1.1 million shares of stock during the quarter for $32.5 million. The tax rate in the December quarter was 2%.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 268 million. There was a 2.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes due to an increase in the average stock price during the quarter. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $95 million to approximately $3.0 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.7 billion. Days sales outstanding increased 3 days in December quarter to 38 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $2.2 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days, both at Xilinx and distribution were 142 days, up from 126 days in the prior quarter. In the March quarter, we expect both dollars and days of inventory to decline significantly as we realign our supply with the demand trends.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '12. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting strong growth from our 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer product families. From an end-market perspective, we are expecting sales from communications to be up slightly sequentially, with wireless up modestly after a weak December quarter and wireline sales approximately flat. We expect industrial and other sales to increase as normal spending patterns return to many of our customers following 2 quarters of inventory drain.","Additionally, we are expecting defense sales to increase during the quarter, driven in part by last time buy activity, but more significantly by the commencement of a large program.","Consumer sales are expected to be approximately flat, and data processing sales are expected to decrease sequentially. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 2% to up 6% sequentially, with sales from Europe expected to increase, sales from Asia-Pacific expected to decrease and sales from North America and Japan to be approximately flat.","The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%. Gross margin is expected to be between 64% and 65% as we absorb new product ramp costs and customer mix returns to normal historical levels.","Operating expenses in the March quarter are expected to be approximately $207 million, including approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The majority of the growth in spending compared with the December quarter is in R&D and related to the 28-nanometer ramp as our tape-out activity remains high. There's also some growth in SG&A related primarily to variable spending increases as result of higher revenue and growth in some key marketing and sales programs. The full year spending number is approximately $810 million, lower than our previous estimate of $820 million to $830 million. We will provide fiscal year 2013 guidance at our upcoming Analyst Meeting on February 15 in San Francisco.","Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $10 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 270 million shares, and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While we obviously have not been immune to the weakness in the current economic environment, I am pleased with the nearly 20% combined sequential growth from our Virtex-6 40-nanometer and Spartan-6 45-nanometer families. Virtex-6, in particular, experienced very strong growth from wired comms and storage applications. We expect these families to show continued growth in the March quarter based on the beginning backlog and customer forecasts.","As we begin 2012, I've grown ever more confident about the competitiveness and customer value of our next-generation 28-nanometer product portfolio. This is because our top customers around the world are consistently telling us we're delivering indisputable leadership in terms of 28-nanometer technology. I'm extremely pleased with the execution of the 28-nanometer rollout, which is without question the most aggressive and complete new product rollout in our history. We have now delivered more than 10 tape-outs and are confident, by the middle of this year, to be sampling members from our entire 28-nanometer family.","Additionally, the industry's first 28-nanometer product, the Kintex-7 K325T, recently passed rigorous qualification criteria, would release for production shipments, as planned, in the June quarter. 28-nanometer success would not have been achieved without our exemplary technology partnership and collaboration with TSMC. TSMC's fully qualified HPL process optimized for both performance and power has provided us significant time-to-market advantage and is providing yields that are in line with our aggressive roadmap and better than what we had experienced in previous generations.","This past quarter, we achieved 2 very significant 28-nanometer milestones. First, we began shipping the industry's first extensible processing platform, the Zynq-7000 device. This family enables a new level of hardware-software systems integration with a complete ARM Cortex processing subsystem and low-power programmable logic. With a very significant time-to-market advantage over the competition, design wins already totaling well over $100 million, this new class of product is creating an unprecedented level of excitement value in our customer base.","We also began shipping the first device from our SSIT, Stacked Silicon Interconnect Technology family. The Virtex-7 2000T device is the industry's highest capacity programmable logic device, with 2 million logic sales, delivering twice or more of the capacity of competitive devices through single-chip FPGA integration. This innovation is absolutely game changing, conservatively providing us with at least a 2-year time-to-market advantage. Design win momentum has been exceptionally strong with over 30 wins valued at more than $100 million.  Our only challenge at this point is our ability to more quickly ramp supply to meet all of the demand for this product. We're very actively working through all constraints and are confident that we'll be able to align our supply with the demand for this product line.","We now have four of the five 28-nanometer product family shipping in the market. The Zynq and Stacked Silicon Interconnect initial shipments were preceded by the shipment of key Kintex-7 and Virtex-7, both mid- and high-end family members. With 28-nanometer design wins now totaling nearly 350 and well over $1 billion in terms of design win value, we have approximately 90 discrete customers currently designing in members of the 28-nanometer product family, demonstrating the broad-based acceptance of it.","In the March quarter, we are anticipating continued strong sales growth and by the June quarter, expect to comfortably exceed $10 million quarterly sales for this family.","Finally, after reviewing input from over 120 customers on our 28-nanometer leadership position, I can tell you that in my more than 30 years in the high tech industry, I have never seen a single product generation which has the level and breadth of customer impact as our existing 28-nanometer portfolio.","I look forward to providing you with an update on our 28-nanometer momentum at our annual Analyst Meeting, which is scheduled February 15 in San Francisco.","Let me turn -- let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering on the wireless communication side, could you talk a little bit about the visibility you're seeing in terms of your customer programs there? It sounds like you're expecting that to increase slightly in the March quarter. When do you think that might bounce back more materially? And are you seeing that bounce back happening more in the 2G, 3G or 4G areas?","Jon A. Olson","Jim, this is Jon. The visibility on wireless is really not very good for us. And while we still have, I would say, a reasonable level of business broadly across older generation technology, the uptake, particularly in North America, has been much weaker than the trend has been over the last 4 quarters. And then I think it's also pretty widely known that the next wave in China has yet to materialize in the same way that's being talked about. So we're kind of, in some respects, we're in a bit of a holding pattern waiting because the information we're getting from our customers doesn't really give us a precise quarter that they think the capital spend is going to start increasing at all those various providers. So it would be premature for me to speculate on when that might be. I still strongly believe it's just a matter of when, not if, just because of the strong need for bandwidth and the move towards LTE more globally, where we have an extremely strong position. So I'm not being very helpful, I know, relative to telling you exactly which quarter, but we think it is coming.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then maybe as a follow-up, I'll ask you maybe a similar thing on the wireline side. It sounds like that really hasn't even bounced back cyclically at all at this point, and we heard anecdotally from a lot of carriers that they were postponing a bunch of new wireline programs into sometime in 2012. Any more visibility on -- I know you have limited visibility across the board, but do you think that wireline comes back later than wireless when it does?","Jon A. Olson","I don't know exactly what specific programs you're referring to but -- and if you can tell, I probably couldn't give you specific customer data anyway. But we've seen a recent, I'll say, mini-surge off a low inventory point at several key customers. And so we're trying to read that ourselves to figure out whether it's an inventory replenishment above all others or it's got more legs. I think if you listen to the network guys, what they're saying, it's a little patchy as to whether they're highly confident or less confident going forward. So I think we're still in choppy waters there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Moshe, let me just follow by asking you about some of the comments you made on 28-nanometers. First of all, congratulations on the very strong design wins. But can you help me understand your 28-nanometer design wins today compare that with 40. And over the next year, my assumption is that 40 will still be the main revenue driver even though 28 design activities going on. Where do you see your 40-nanometer market share versus 28? And how do you see the growth of 28 ramping between now and, say, the end of 2012?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. So let me first talk about 28. We have an extremely broad product line at 28, 5 distinct families: Altix, Kintex, Virtex, SSIT, which is a high-end and unparalleled in terms of density so it actually opens up a new market for us, and then there's the Zynq product line, which again is -- opens up a whole new set of market. When we look at our competitive position, our expectation is that we will have 70% of the market at least, and that's based on the fact that in 2 of the 5 areas, there is no competition now, and we expect that competition to take a long time to come. And on the other 3 areas, we actually feel we have an incredibly strong hand. Now in terms of how quickly we expect it to come out of the gate, it is coming out very quickly, much faster than the previous 2 generations of product. And because the yields are also very high and the demand is there because it either can enable capabilities that aren't possible with the previous generation of technology or if they are possible, then it's a lower power point and over time, a lower cost point, we expect that to grow at a very fast rate. So if you look at Virtex-5, which was our previous generation, a previous more successful generation, then that took 3 to 5 years to reach its peak. Here, we expect that the peak A will be much higher because it opens up significant new markets, and we actually feel that we have a much better competitive hand. So we would expect, as we indicated, $10 million or more in what is the April, May, June quarter, and we expect it to grow rapidly from that point forward. So we aren't giving predictions, but that's much faster than we've seen previous generations of product. The 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer, we clearly came out later than the competition. Our strength there is driven by the fact that we have a low-end product in the 45 and that is doing well. Overall, our goal on the 40 and 45 is to close in, over time, on 50% market share. We're clearly not there now, and it's going to take us some time to get to that point. But in parallel, we expect the 28-nanometer to totally flip the way the market share has grown over the past few years and enable us to win back significant market share. When that will become extremely visible? It becomes visible when the 28-nanometer moves into significant volume. If you look at the numbers, given that we're -- the market in of itself is between $4 billion to $5 billion now, then it requires more than $10 million per quarter to make a significant dent there. But at the rate that it's growing, by the end of the year, this should be very visible.","Jon A. Olson","I'd like to add one more thing. When we looked at this last of how we're doing versus the ramp on 40-nanometer, it actually wasn't this quarter. It was a quarter ago when we talked about having accreted $600 million of the design wins. We were 60% ahead of where we were on -- we were on 28 versus where we were at 40. And I actually didn't have a look at it at the end of this quarter, it could even be a bigger percentage. We'll try to give a little bit more information about that at the Analyst Day.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can I just ask you one question? Of the $10 million revenue you have now, how much of that is the SSIT product? Because from the numbers you provided, Moshe, it is a very high ASP product, and I don't know whether that is something that could be a sustained growth beyond the accumulation phase. So I'm not sure how to think about the sustainability, what the mix of that is and what the sustainability of the SSIT product would be.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Yes, so the projection we made for $10 million is in the April through June quarter, and that does not require a huge amount of SSIT revenue. And so you shouldn't assume that SSIT is necessarily a huge percentage of that. And the reason that we believe that it has longevity is that if you look at the capabilities there, there's no way to get to those capabilities unless you design a high-end ASIC, which obviously is becoming less and less viable. So we actually are seeing 2 -- no, sorry, 3 very large markets using it, one is prototyping and you can say that's the one which tends to surge and then decline, but the 2 which have longevity are the wired communications, where it replaces ASIC and the Mil\/Aero where there's a huge demand for very high-end devices. And both of those, obviously wired communications happens at a faster rate typically than the military market, but both of those tend to have long life cycles.","Jon A. Olson","Yes. I also want to point out a couple of other things about the SSIT family, is that we have more than one member of that family, there's 3 members. And some of those members have a very high capability and total bandwidth for transceivers as well. And so this will get used a lot in communications design. So as those get taped out and through the sampling phase, et cetera, we think there's going to be a lot of legs in this particular family.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just on gross margin, guys. You guys have done a really good job in committing to the Street and then executing on that. I was just curious, despite the big comp customers coming back, you had a slight upside. How should we think about margins? What are the puts and takes around the 64%, 65% target that you guys have set? And then a quick follow-up, on inventory, Jon, is this a continued buildup from the end-of-line legacy that caused the total inventory to go up in the last quarter as well?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So on the gross margin, Ambrish, it spiked up in part by, we talked about customer mix, which essentially means we had a lower percentage contribution from large communications customers. And that had an impact of somewhere less than a point, but in that general neighborhood. So that brings us back down into more in the normal range that we have. And then as we tape out, we have many, many tape-outs going on right now, all going on at various stages in parallel, and that causes us to produce units that engineering has to test, et cetera, and some of those are salable, some of those aren't. So some of those things end up impacting our margin, but we've been able to hold ourselves at least within our model even to the start-up phase. So those are some of the bigger impacts. One other impact is that as we are cutting wafers pretty significantly, we have been the last 2 quarters, and that will kind of, I'll say, overrun our revenue decline now and therefore we'll see a precipitous drop in inventory dollars next quarter. And that has some high costs falling out that had some downward pressure to our gross margins and puts us in that 64% to 65% range. So those are the factors. So I would expect as we continue to have the ramp and get rid of the start-up costs, I suspect that we'll have, out in time, upward pressure going on in the gross margin number. We're kind of at a low point, if you will, at this point in time. From an inventory perspective, look, as you know, dollars went down very slightly, but let's say inventory was flat and days just shot up, and that's just a function of the arithmetic because revenue is down, and you use the cost of sales number to create the days number, so it was in absolute dollar, a lower number than in previous quarters. So days happened to shoot up even though inventory dollars really didn't go up. There is some of the last time buy inventory that is in there. It stays relatively constant for the next few quarters, just like our last time buy revenue will stay relatively constant for the next several quarters, so we're not seeing any real revenue blips because of last time buy or any significant declines in revenue coming because of the last time buy. It just takes a -- we've had to build so much of it because of the fab line that's being discontinued. We're just trying to manage that to a flat dollar level over the next 4 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BoA Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm trying to compare your current visibility versus how it was, I think, in December or so when you gave your outlook. What end markets are you more confident about now? What end markets are still sort of uncertain? Where I'm going with that is your March guidance is suddenly getting closer to normal seasonality, but I'm still sensing some uncertainty in your comments about end markets. I'm just trying to read the lines here on what the underlying turns are? What end markets do you like, what are still sort of uncertain right now?","Jon A. Olson","I gave some comments earlier about the communications market. I think by our tone in the words, you'd probably come to conclusion that we think wireless has bottomed out for us, and we're -- now we're kind of waiting for whether there's additional CapEx spends by our customer's customer or not, even though we do see some modest increases going on there. And in the wireless segment, still choppy, not easy to predict where that's going or where the IT spend is really going to go or where the cable and satellite provider spend is really going to go. So I would say there, it's not really whether we like it or we don't like that. I'd say that the confidence level is -- we feel like we're pretty close to bouncing on the bottom, and we're not really sure when things are going to, I'll say, more fully recover to where they were 3 or 4 quarters ago. Almost the same statement on industrial and other. We do feel that that's more of an inventory drain situation, and that people have corrected their inventory and we're seeing a lot more orders coming. One of the reasons that revenue was a little higher than we thought, both primarily communications customers, but distribution also ended up being stronger in December than we had anticipated. Overall, we've pretty much counted on the last week or 2 to be very sparse with factories being closed because people didn't have a need to build stuff so they gave time off, and that was some of the word that we were getting through distribution. But then that actually didn't happen in the same way that we had anticipated. So a lot of our industrial customers come through our distribution networks, so that gives me a very positive feeling around. Again, we feel like we've reached the bottom on industrial. When is it going to come back? Consumer typically a little weaker in the March quarter anyway, so that's pretty much in data processing. That doesn't move the needle one way or the other that much for us. So I hope that's helpful.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Very helpful. And just a follow-up clarification and a question. What was the 40-nanometer as percentage of sales mix? And then the bigger question is very impressive design wins at 28-nanometer. I'm curious; when do you expect that to be, I don't know, say, take 10% of industry sales? Is it more a 2013 or 2014 time frame?","Jon A. Olson","I'll deal with the second one first. So the 28-nanometer design wins are a myriad of end markets, end customers in various stages of rolling out their products. So you can't really project the size of the ramp, if you will, or the speed of the ramp. But because we have so many different customers and so many designs, just our experience is that ramp is going to manifest itself faster than we've seen in the last couple of generations. So in some respects, we're going on some very specific information from specific customers. In other respects, where it's a very broad set of customers, we're kind of going on the way trends have worked in the past. So again, we try to give the best information we have, not overcommit on things and we think we've given you a pretty fair statement on that. Your question on 40-nanometer was around percent of sales. We really did not provide that this quarter. I don't think we're going to provide that number.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays Capital.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question, and I realize visibility is somewhat limited here, but curious how you see the shape of the cycle off of the trough here?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. I'll give you my two cents. I don't know if Moshe has anything to add to that. But having lived through some of these before and see that there's certainly some end markets here where this is more -- it's a demand driven in addition to inventory correction, I view this generally as kind of a slow movement off the bottom over the next couple of quarters and then a better second half. But that's just an experiential thing, I don't think we have any data that necessarily supports that, because I think we look at the same reports that you guys do.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And as a quick -- sorry, go ahead.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","My prospective, this is Moshe here, is that the one market which unquestionably is on fire relates to the smartphones. And if you look at what is happening there and the demands that they're putting on the underlying infrastructure, at a minimum, as those -- when people are moving away even in emerging markets and lower-cost markets, they're moving away from what I call feature phones, these smartphones. These phones generate huge, huge, huge bandwidth demands and as such, definitely, the systems need to be upgraded to support those. So on communications, both in particular, wireless communications infrastructure, coming back to Jon's comment at the very beginning, that can't continue. It has to be upgraded; otherwise, people will revolt against the fact that their phones, while flashy, can't be used for anything. And it's a huge business opportunity, and I'm very convinced that that's a question, as Jon put it, of when as opposed to will it happen. It definitely needs to happen soon. And we're seeing similar trends in other markets, which has similar characteristics but maybe they're not as visible because it's not driven by consumer smartphones which everyone knows about. So the other thing I'm hearing is in the whole host of ecosystem plays, there's been a huge bounce back from a very significant trough to now everyone building up to support the imminent requirements. And so I feel that good things are happening and timing might still be a question mark but just generally, I'm very bullish about the secular trends which are driving all of these needs.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's very helpful. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. When you think about 28-nanometer growing as a percentage of your mix, I'm curious, given the increased capital intensity at the foundries growing roughly 50%, we're in the move from 4x to 28-nanometer, what impact that will have on your gross margin? So how should we think about that? I know it's down the road a bit, but we'd love to hear your thoughts there.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, every generation becomes significantly more expensive and 28-nanometer, vis-a-vis 20, if you just look at the wafer prices, there's no doubt that they're going up there, there's less suppliers and the equipment is more expensive and the number of customers who are driving at the leading edge is much smaller so as a result, you don't see the normal, more slow, that's one trend. The other -- on the other side, to balance that, there's huge amount of engineering, which is being put in place in the product design, in the product design for manufacturability and in the operations flow, which makes us very confident that we can, to some extent, compensate for those. So in terms of margins long term, we're shooting for the same margins, and in the short term, as Jon mentioned, we're actually being able to absorb this new technology, which is a lot more expensive for us, better than we have before, a lot of it due to these elements plus obviously, there's the higher yields we're seeing, which are helping out. So we're not, at this point at 28, expecting negative impact on margins for our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So you guys are guiding -- if I look at the numbers, kind of in line with what I would view as normal seasonal for the first quarter. I wonder if -- I guess just some questions about the relative expectations for the year. And 3 things: One, do you think normal seasonal is a pattern that is sort of the benchmark you're going to use for the rest of the year? Two, do you think that your business will outgrow the overall chip market? And thirdly, do you think that you should outgrow the end markets because you'll benefit from an inventory replenishment on top of just demand growth?","Jon A. Olson","So, no, even though it does appear March is in much seasonal line with this, I'm not sure I feel like we're -- the whole year ends up being seasonal, because I think there's some recovery that comes on this year, and so that kind of wipes out the seasonal -- the underlying seasonal activity that would normally go on end market-by-end market. So I don't see that seasonal affect naturally holding on this year. So I guess maybe I'm a little more bullish this year than maybe what seasonal or 5-year trends would say -- averages would say for us. I do think we are going to outgrow the rest of the semiconductor industry. I think we've been saying that for some time, I still believe that. We tend to talk about this in longer-term CAGRs, so any given year could look one way but we do think on the whole, it will be better. And then the intensity we have in terms of penetration at our large customers is growing, and the breadth of our new technology is helping us get there just as Moshe talked about today. So I guess that's a no, yes, yes.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then let me ask you a question just by bringing it closer to now, I suppose. Can you just talk a little bit about how your order patterns looked as you exited the year, and then how that may have changed, if at all, in January? And then you talk about sort of an uncertainty as to whether or not this will stick. I just wonder what are the kind of things you'll be looking for from your customers. What do you need to hear from them to give you confidence this is a recovery or it's not?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so the order patterns, again, we left -- we ended the quarter stronger than we thought. We ended with backlog higher than we entered the previous quarter. So these were all things that we viewed as very positive signs, and we were probably a little more bearish during the December month than we should have been, obviously. And so I think we -- we're bolstered by what we see in the backlog and how things are going so far in the first, very short 2 weeks of January. But quite frankly, we need the large customers to order parts and not push out what's on the backlog today, and that will give us some good signs. To me, that's the biggest sign, when the top 25 are in the game and they start putting orders on us and in some cases even expediting, that's what's going to make me start feeling a lot better.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Well, it sounds like you'll give us an update on the trajectory of OpEx next year. But I was wondering if you could talk about maybe when you're -- when you expect the peak quarter to be in your 28-nanometer tape-outs? I believe in the past, you thought OpEx could decline next year. I'm just trying to figure out what the trajectory could look like at this point.","Jon A. Olson","So I have a hard time answering that question without actually answering the question I said I'm not going to answer, which is talk about spending number for next year. And we -- part of lowering our, and I've said this on the investor conference, or a good part of the lowering of our spending engineering number this year, our OpEx number for this year lower than we had anticipated was because we've moved some things from one year to the next. We've re-calendarized some of our tape-outs in addition to taking out discretionary spending, and that's what's caused our number to be going down from the $850 million or so kind of number down to -- $850 million or $860 million number. We're talking about million dollars of operating spending, now down to $810 million for this fiscal year. So that does imply that there is some of that going on. But because we haven't talked about what the full year is going to look like, I'd be hesitant to say exactly what the profile of engineering spending is going to be next year. That's what we're going to talk about in 3 weeks.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","You can't talk about when you think the peak tape-outs will be, if they will be in the first half or the second half?","Jon A. Olson","Well, the peak, yes. The peak will be, of 28-nanometer tape-outs, is more likely in the first half, but you have to actually know the profile to know whether that -- whether there's a flat roof or a peaked if you go back to my Analyst Day presentation. [indiscernible]","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then a follow-up on the...","Jon A. Olson","I'm not sure that's helpful. I'm afraid you're going to take -- you're going to draw conclusions from that, that may not be accurate, so just be careful with that.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","My conclusion is I need to wait for next month. So if I could ask a follow-up question on the inventory side. Can you give us some color on how channel inventory -- just the inventory declines stay flat or go up? And what's your view on the OEM side of the inventory equation?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. Our channel inventory has been pretty flat from a days perspective, so it's kind of tracked -- it's tracked our revenue numbers; been pretty flat around 15 total days for the company, plus or minus a couple, quarter-by-quarter for the last 4 quarters. And essentially we've again had short lead times. The distributors are quite confident they can get parts very rapidly, so they haven't been stockpiling parts nor have they been necessarily overly leaned out with respect to Xilinx. I can't speak for other lines that they're carrying. So for me, the inventory number isn't particularly a concern. Inventory at customers, we -- throughout the December quarter, we definitely had an increase of pull-ins by customers, meaning numbers of customers who were asking us to pull things in, which is a good sign that they have leaned up their inventory and they need things. These are all sizes of customers. I did point out that the last 2 weeks we had unexpected labels from large communication customers. One more in addition to our distribution customers. So to me, that's a good sign that we are bouncing along the bottom because while we still have some push-outs and reschedules, we also have some pull-ins. So it feels to me like that inventory at customers has worked its way through, for the most part with some exceptions, and we're now kind of more, I'll call it, hand-to-mouth, depending on what their end demand is.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Moshe, I have a question on the 28-nanometer products and the comments around $10 million in revenue through the April to June quarter. If you think about the ramp and how you guys were thinking about 28-nanometer maybe 6 months ago or even last year at your Analyst Day, would you say that the revenue ramp is moving in line with your expectations? Or do you think the macro -- the challenging macro has had some impact and perhaps some delays in some of the programs that you had won? And if so, do you think that there will be potentially an inflection point or a step function increase in 28-nanometer revenue later this year?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So that's another great question. So intuitively, it feels that it's happening more or less a quarter later than we had expected. Part of those are issues in the market, part of those are making sure that the products are fully qualified. As we have this scalable architecture and now that we have the first product basically having gone through -- both the processes qualified, that's happened a long time ago at TSMC and now the product is qualified to extend, that enables us to apply the pedal to the metal in terms of getting all of the other products out in an accelerated mode. And I do believe that, that will enable faster growth from this point on. And so the numbers we've projected are just the beginning of what we consider to be a significant ramp. And given that we have 5 product families, 4 of which already are sampling and the fifth is actually the simplest one, which already actually has been demonstrated, it's a subset of the previous ones, we feel very, very, very confident in our ability to bring this to market. And we do expect it to accelerate. Now the different products do tend to have different profiles and because we've started with the midrange product, which is Kintex, and we're now moving, and the Virtex product is catching up with that, that should provide some acceleration, too, because that tends to have a much higher ASP as does the SSIT, which was one of the questions we were asked about previously. So I know this is a supposed answer, but the answer -- if you summarize all of that, it should grow very rapidly through the second half of the year due to the breadth of the product offering.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And just quickly around Zynq and given that you've got some early returns from customers, would you say that the initial activity is in areas that would be incremental to the FPGA TAM? Or how are design wins working out? Is it kind of FPGA late replacement sockets or new sockets that you wouldn't traditionally hit?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So the markets we're addressing definitely -- we have tens of thousands of customers in nearly every market. So this is less opening a new market, but it enables us to significantly increase our penetration into markets which are not necessarily FPGA-centric. And an example on Zynq, which was targeted at 3 general markets: automotive, ISM and to a lesser degree, communications, we're seeing a totally new set of applications in automotive, for example, where truthfully, our percentage of the BOM before would be minuscule, and the percentage of the BOM now or the bill of materials is very, very significant. So no, it basically enables us to replace the solutions which used external processors, external DSPs, external analog mixed signal capabilities and external FPGAs to -- so it is a market expansion because it is -- it does have an FPGA element, there is an element of FPGA design, the tools we are providing to enable a larger, less skilled set of customers will be the key to enabling us to address that larger market in terms of designers, and that will enable us to reach a larger TAM.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It seems that both Altera and Xilinx are doing FPGA and microprocessor integrations, and it's not clear to me what the difference is, and I'm hoping that you can help me understand what's the difference between what you guys are doing, what your competition is doing.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. Well, we've been focused on this area for a very, very, very long time, and you can check comments made by the competitor on this area as to when they got into it. As a result, we believe we have customer engagements for years now that are now reaching fruition, and we have a very, very significant time-to-market advantage. At this point in time, what we see from the competition is very early and if we compare it, it's probably equivalent to things which we showed customers over 2 years ago. And so we feel very comfortable with our product offering. We were there first. We have a very broad product offering. We have sampled, it works. It's in customer systems. The customer systems are working. We feel very good at our -- with our competitive position. We obviously need to continue running, right, because if you stop running, then the competition will catch up, but we definitely have a very significant early lead there.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, Mark, one more thing. I don't think we can actually say much about their products since it only exists on the paper and a block diagram, which happens to look close to silicon block diagram, looks very close to our block diagram. But there isn't any unit out there, there isn't any evaluation boards out there that I'm aware of, and so it's hard to know exactly what they will do with it. And I think, as you know, it isn't just about a piece of silicon, it's around all the software ecosystem, et cetera, that you build around a processor subsystem. And as Moshe said, we've been working on this for quite a few years and with real customers engaging on this. So it's actually difficult to make a real competitive comparison at this juncture.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Can you just say what are the biggest end-market applications?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","They are automotive, industrial and communications.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When your sales started to pick up towards the end of the year and into this year, what did your customers say or distributors say as to the reason that they were ordering more? Was it that their demand was better or was it just that they'd kind of gone through the inventory burn phase, and they were taking some up or a little of both?","Jon A. Olson","I would say it's about 50\/50, based on what I can tell. So I tried to go through the end markets and the customers because I was trying to understand that and get people to explain that to me as well. And the best information I have today from the distribution side were it's just a lot of different customers involved in it. It's really kind of been a little of both. The networking side, et cetera, I don't have as clear of an answer on that question.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just as a follow up on, it sounds like things are bottoming here. You guys have plenty of cash. I'm just curious as to why not get a little more aggressive on the buyback?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. Well, this is an annual process that we go through in our discussions with the board, and we certainly will be discussing all of the alternatives. As we have been committed historically to both and we continue to be committed to both dividends and cash repurchases, so I think you can expect us to continue to look at both of those as opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.","Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Jon, you talked about, last time, a program in defense. I'm just wondering if you can quantify it and also said that it's not going to go away, at least this quarter. I'm just wondering when it goes away.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, there are 2 things going on in defense for next quarter. There is some last time buy which is, I'll say, a relatively small portion in terms of billions of dollars, really small, if you will, but it's just needing some additional -- some parts, I guess, the last time buy program that we have. The bigger growth is really this new buy for a relatively new program or I should say an increase in the program of one of the defense contractors. So that's really where the biggest growth amount is coming from. Overall, if you look overall at the last time buy from this fab line obsolescence thing that we have  going, it's a very small increase overall for the company next quarter, and it remains kind of in this low-single digit bouncing around tolerance band of revenue. It was last quarter and it will for the next 3 or 4 quarters. So we're not really getting a lot incremental is what I'm trying to tell you from the last time buy.","Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then just one clarification. On the enterprise side, you said that, that business grew in December quarter. Just wondering if you think that is just demand being a little better? And also if you could give us what's your expectation for that market is in Q1, that would be great. I mean, I'm talking the March quarter.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, well, I would read that as a positive sign for us in the network area from the standpoint of just the overall ordering patterns have been low and choppy, and I think the increase was a positive sign relative to what's going on in the potential IT spend area going into the new year, so our least expectation is that people are going to continue to buy equipment, so I think that's a pretty good sign.","Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And your expectation is that it will grow in Q1?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. Again, that's back to my answer to one of the earlier questions. I think wireline is still pretty choppy, and it's not clear to me that it's sustainable yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of clarifications on what you said about 40, 45-nanometers. If I understand, you said you want to close in on 50% share at this node. But that includes your low-end product on 40, 45, so you would have lower than 50% market share at the high-end product, is that correct? And can you also give us some sense of what percentage your 40, 45-nanometer reps now at high end versus low end?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So traditionally, the high end has been 2\/3 of the market, and the high volume or lower end has been 1\/3. And what we expect is for the sum of those to enable us to get to 50%, and part of that is driven by the fact that there is no competitive -- significant competitive product at the 45-nanometer node that we're competing with. So we think we'll have pretty plain sailing and we have a lot of high volume but more lower ASP design wins there, which benefit from what is a very strong profile in terms of low cost and actually very low power, too. And that would be our projection. It requires acceleration of our growth because we're definitely starting from behind these families. We're several months behind the competition, which did a good job and came out first, which is by the way why we made sure that at 28-nanometer that did not repeat and if anything, we feel we're well ahead on 28-nanometer.","Jon A. Olson","We didn't really comment on the components. We're not going to, but the 45-nanometer, our high-volume product, didn't grow as well quarter-to-quarter and as well as the high volume and we said there was 20% growth for that category quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sujee De Silva.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Maybe can you try to, from your anecdotal conversations, handicap the likelihood of wireless infrastructure spending snaps back some time in 2012 or can it stay at this low level?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, my position is that it can't basically because in Palo Alto, I can't get cell coverage, right? And then in China, which I was there last week, it used to have pretty good cell coverage and now seeing a lot of dropped calls in China, and this is based on one person's anecdotal information. I fundamentally believe that what is happening is there's a gross mismatch between the infrastructure and the consumer purchases, and that this will sooner or later generate a huge problem that will need to be addressed. And if you look at North America, the big carriers are trying to address this by limiting bandwidth, throttling back. There's a whole host of techniques that are being used. But at the end of the day, the number of smart cellphones is growing at such a fast rate that, in my mind, it's going to totally overwhelm the system. Having -- and this is not a North America-only phenomenon. It's clearly happening in China, too, in a big way as the number of smartphones is growing at a very rapid rate, and we expect it to have worldwide ramification. So I just don't see how you can go through another year of not investing in bandwidth unless there's a year of not selling cellphones, right? It's just at an imbalance already at this point and it's getting worse. And the number of applications and the usage models are just more and more bandwidth-intensive. So I don't think it's sustainable and it will happen. It will happen in different rates where it's driven by government mandate as opposed to where it's driven maybe only by commercial interests, but I think in both cases, there's absolutely a huge demand.","Sujeeva De Silva - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","And then on 28-nanometer, thanks for giving us the $10 million forecast. I imagine that's concentrated around the Kintex and Virtex products initially. A year out, will that be spread between the 5 product families or still concentrated among one or two 28-nanometer families?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","It will be spread for sure on all 5, but it won't be evenly spread on all 5. I would expect Kintex and Virtex to be the 2 largest ones, then SSIT to be the third and then Zynq and Altix to be the fourth. And there's just an intuitive response as to how it's expected to be. And some of the significant growth in Kintex is driven by the fact that we believe it has sustainable competitive advantage in the midrange, particularly for wireless applications.","Rick Muscha","Well, thanks for joining us today.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Rick. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining what is my 41st and final Xilinx earnings call. Been a great privilege to have lead Xilinx over the past 10 years. Needless to say I'm extremely proud what the Xilinx team has accomplished. On the business side, we're questionably on the very consistent growth trajectory having just delivered our ninth straight revenue growth quarter while attaining a 30% operating margin target. In addition, we're quite confident that we'll make it 10 in a row potentially exceed our revenue target of $2.5 billion of this fiscal year.","On the operations and technology front we've delivered three consecutive generations of technology leadership by developing both world class silicon and highly optimized software capability. This has facilitated the strategic transition from our FPGA roots of the premier All Programmable Company thereby enabling Xilinx to participate in a much broader and deeper way in our customers multi-market solution and expand beyond our traditional market. I'm delighted to have this opportunity to hand over the CEO of reigns at Xilinx to my long-term colleague Victor Peng, a huge contributor to our success over the past 10 years. I'm very confident in the future success Xilinx under this stewardship.","This time I'll turn the call over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you Moshe and it's been a pleasure to work with you for almost 10 years I've been here particularly to serve with you as the CFO over the past almost two years.","Moshe Gavrielov","That is great.","Lorenzo Flores","It's not but I'm adlibbing. I'll go back to the script now. But we do wish you well. Sales in the December quarter increased for the ninth consecutive quarter to a record of $631 million, up 2% sequentially and up 8% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the ninth months of fiscal year-to-date were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our advanced products which grew 10% sequentially and 30% year-over-year to a new record.","Gross margin was 71.1% higher than our guidance as product mix was more favorable than expected. Operating expense was $259 million in line with our forecast, we continue to execute to the plan we outlined at our analyst day last May. Operating income for the quarter increased 2.4% sequentially to $189.7 million. Our operating margin hit 30.1% one quarter ahead of schedule. As a result of the enactment of Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, we incurred a tax expense of $183.2 million or a rate of 94% in the December quarter. This one-time tax impact was related to the transition tax on accumulative foreign earnings and the remeasurement of certain tax assets and liabilities somewhat offset by the reduction in the US Statutory rate.","Our net income for Q3 was $11.9 million or $0.05 per share. For comparison purposes if our tax rate had been in the middle of our forecasted range, our EPS would have been $0.67 per share. Now onto the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $1.9 billion net cash after our debt. Operating cash flow was $185 million. We returned $162 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form $89 million in dividends and the repurchase of approximately 1 million shares or $73 million, an average price of $71.34 per share.","During the first nine months of the fiscal year we have returned nearly 100% of our operating cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. As we have said in the past, we continue to invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and will continue to return capital to our shareholders. We are still executing on our share repurchase program and have $372 million remaining on that authorization. We expect ending share count in the March quarter to be in the range of $255 million to $260 million diluted shares.","For guidance, in the March quarter we're expecting sales to be between $635 million and $665 million. Our backlog is up strongly as we begin the quarter and we continue to expect growth in our advanced products. With regards to end markets we expect communications and data center to be up. Industrial and A&D will be approximately flat. Broadcast, consumer and automotive is also expected to grow. While auto and broadcast are growing. A significant amount of growth in this set of end markets will be from consumer which bear some explanation. We've treated crypto currency as it has emergency as a consumer business. This business has become larger and more durable driving growth in the fiscal Q4 though it is still potentially volatile, Victor will also talk more about this.","Our gross margin for the quarter will be approximately 69% to 71%. We expect core operating expense to decrease to approximately $255 million. However, in this quarter we will recognize one-time expenses of approximately $30 million related primarily through our CEO transition. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 0% and 5% for this quarter as impacted by the Tax Reform Act. Our financial performance year-to-date and our guidance for the fourth quarter indicate to us that we're on track to meet or exceed our annual guidance on all operating parameters.","Let me now turn the call over to Victor.","Victor Peng","Thank you, Lorenzo and my sincere thanks to you, Moshe. I'm going to stay on script because well this is your 41st call. This is my first. And I probably shouldn't blow it at. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm truly honored and extremely excited to be speaking with you on my first Xilinx's quarterly earnings call. And I'm particularly fortunate to be assuming leadership not only with Moshe taking this company to such a great position, but and truly a very dynamic time in our industry. By focusing on delivering unique values and emerging areas as well as our traditional markets, we will build on this revenue growth we've established and create the next wave of shareholder value.","In an era where the pace of Morris [ph] law has showed. Xilinx is in a unique and unprecedented position of strength. Enormous amounts of data being created, stored and processed presents tremendous opportunities with Xilinx. Applications like machine learning, computing and storage acceleration, autonomous driving and 5G all promise to make an enormous impact on people's lives.","Tomorrow's compute intensive applications require optimize platforms and are capable of delivering both acceleration and adaptability. Xilinx presents the right technologies and capabilities to take leadership position. And I'm delighted to have this opportunity to help the company maximize this potential. I would like to add my comments about both December quarter and the outlook for the March quarter. I'm very pleased with our consistent execution as demonstrated in our December quarter results.","Revenue grew as Moshe said for the ninth consecutive quarter to the records $631 million. Additionally our operating margin exceeded 30% one quarter ahead of our plan driven by better than expected gross margin. Our overall revenue growth was again driven by our advanced products. Revenue from these products increased 10% sequentially and 30% year-over-year. This category now represents 56% of our overall revenue significantly up from 52% last quarter and 47% a year ago. Both our industry leading 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer technology node had significant sales records.","With our 16-nanometer portfolio we're now delivering 43 unique products to approximately 1,160 customers. Revenues from our Zynq SoC platform an integral element of our multi-market expansion efforts increased nearly 40% from the year ago quarter and is expected to grow again in the March quarter. This platform has established sales traction in all of our end markets with significant success in the automotive, industrial, wireless and consumer market. As Lorenzo noted, our product is finding some success in crypto currency mining system. We're finding that our products and customer support capabilities really fit the need of this emerging market and we do anticipate future growth while being cautious about the volatility of this segment.","With regards to end markets the industrial, aerospace and defense markets had another quarterly record. With sales of $297 million, an increase of 7% sequentially and 23% from the year ago quarter. This growth was driven by both semiconductor test and the emulation applications. Our unrivaled technology leadership has been a very significant driver for this record setting revenue performance. Our strong momentum in the data center continues unabated. Market leader Alibaba recently announced plans for two generation of FPGAs as a Service. The F2 and F3 using Xilinx Ultrascale plus FPGA.","And beyond the public eye, we're seeing strong activity in workload specific compute acceleration, storage and smart mix. These data center opportunities continue to be one of our key medium to long-term market expansion opportunity. As we look forward to the March quarter, our guidance of $635 million to $665 million is again expect to be driven by the continued growth of our advanced product portfolio. If we achieve this guidance we will establish another sales record with Xilinx. Our overall revenue performance through the three quarters of the year and our Q4 guidance gives us confidence that we will exceed our $2.5 billion plan for fiscal 2018 and as we mention, we already reached our goal of 30% plus operating margin a quarter [indiscernible].","Now I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava","And I'm going to adlib here, Moshe. Thanks for being a gentlemen as these years. We've not always seen eye-to-eye but you always treated us very fairly. So good luck and on the next innings. Question on the up margin and also kudos for hitting the target and my question is for you, Victor. How should we think about sustainability of that given the increase in the next node and that's been the case forever but it seems like a step jump in that and also you're spending more on the FPGA as a Service model. So just help us understand how should investors have confidence that this has been a bogey that has been illusive on a consistent basis for Xilinx. So how should we think about that? Thank you.","Victor Peng","So from a gross margin, that has a lot of factors, but a big factor is mix. So in terms of the way the segment came out, we had really strong growth in segments for which we generally have very good value. Of course it's more complicated that, there's a lot of things we're doing for controlling the COGS and so forth. So I would say we absolutely can excuse me, I was referring to gross margin but in terms of the operating margin obviously that's all true but, so at that level in terms of operating margin. I think we've been very careful about investing where we see bigger returns and also being mindful of where we are on the gross margin line.","So I think that we're going to be balancing those things right. We generally give a range of the upper 60s up into the 70s and I think if we look at how return we would get by investing further we'll do that aggressively and other places we absolutely want to give return to the shareholders, so.","Moshe Gavrielov","So Ambrish, I'm going to think maybe I'm going to ramp some other questions on this. We're - I guess outside of tax which I'll help you guys out a little bit on for the future. We're going to stick with our traditional cadence of providing specific financial guidance initially in our Q4 earnings call and then more in detail at our analyst day. So I think the kind of fundamental principal both that Victor and I laid out will be what we apply, right? Which is we're investing in the company and we're continuing to manage it to return the mostly to the shareholder.","Ambrish Srivastava","And I think the piece that you have given us is the scale and I think that's what I was hoping to hear from you, is that you're reaching, you're about to reach the inflection point on the FPGA as a Service model, which will help fund that.","Victor Peng","I'm sorry I didn't even mention, I didn't answer that piece of the question. Look I think we've been pretty consistent in saying FPGA as a Service is a more mid-term to longer term opportunity. From a revenue perspective that is not yet in a very material state. And also point out, that FPGA as a Service is only one segment of the compute acceleration which is only one segment of our opportunity in the data center. I think we've been pretty consistent in saying that, we have many opportunities not only in the compute side but also in storage and the networking side.","So I think that a little less connected to your question regarding sustainability of the operating margin. I think on the operating margin side again you're seeing right that we have achieved our goal ahead of plan and we do think there is legs [ph] there on the other hand, if we feel like the right thing to do is invest to ensure the strong growth, we'll do that but we'll always be mindful of returning good value to the shareholders.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay, thank you good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Moshe, best wishes on your next adventure here. I was just wondering if you could just talk about the consumer bucket. Obviously the crypto currency is been a big driver for a lot. Maybe just talk about December and then outlook in the March if you can kind of frame how big that's getting and how much of driver is it for that segment in the March.","Victor Peng","Blayne I'm glad you asked that because we're flagging it because in the past this has been really not materially enough to even mention because of the fact that. It's growing and this is - we're talking about like in the below tens of millions. We wanted to flag this however this is not like a GPU size kind of exposure right. And again you heard both Lorenzo and I say that there's a lot of volatility here. So I wouldn't we're mentioning it because now it's not something that's totally negligible but just to give you right order of magnitude. It is not something we're - we suggest you try and model, it's very volatile and it's very new and emerging thing.","Blayne Curtis","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess first I'll start - Moshe congrats, pleasure working with you and Victor, look forward to working with you and congrats to you as well. I guess for my question maybe a kind of follow-up to the first one, as you think about tax reform and access through all that cash, how does that change your thinking if at all in terms of R&D investments as you project to head into beyond fiscal 2018.","Victor Peng","I don't think there is a first order impact from tax reform on our operating model. It comes mostly into play for us in terms of capital allocation. So I think regardless of tax reform and regardless of the quarter-to-quarter specifics we'll maintain very highly profitability and very high cash flow generation. So we see as the primary benefit as tax reform is freer uses of cash on a global basis. I think we're right now understanding some of the longer term impacts of it because there is some second order or more detailed aspects of tax reform that will impact cash payment, so we're modeling that as best we can out into the future and we'll use that to influence what we do on capital allocation, that's still on the works and again we'll probably talk more in detail about that at our analyst day.","C.J. Muse","Do you have a sense of your gap and or cash tax rates or that's something for the analyst day?","Victor Peng","Sure. Like I said totally I think it's unfair to you guys to say okay one quarter 93%, the next quarter it's going to be 0% to 5% and not leave with you any guidance past that. We actually wrap all the considered caveats around this, but as we understand it right now our forward tax rate should be between 10% and 15%. So pretty much like we had experienced in the recent past. So that's our best guidance right now, but it's obviously not without some caution on the potential for regulatory changes as more technical guidance comes out in different aspects of that, but right now it's the best we can get.","C.J. Muse","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","And Moshe I'll echo the sentiment. Thanks for all the help - helping to understand Xilinx through the years, greatly appreciated. I guess my question is sort of follow-up on the margin side. I want to focus really on the gross margin side. This is only the second time in corporate history that I can see in our model that you've had gross margins above 71% and Victor I understand the importance of mix. So I guess part of one of the question is, can you help me understand what happened in the quarter from a mix perspective to make things this rich. And I guess more importantly just given that your broadening your lead against the competition and broadening the number of applications that you can address, why shouldn't we think that there is a continued structural upward biased on gross margins overtime. The caveat being no one should - have to apologize for 71% gross margin.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thanks for that.","Victor Peng","Yes, thanks for that. As I said I talked about mix that was really oversimplification. Look on the one hand, we are creating a lot of value, where our products, our leadership not only because we've executed well and delivered what we said but we've done innovations the most recent one for instance the RFSoC, where we integrated RF class data converters monolithically whereas 16-nanometer digital process. Right. Where that's saving the customer power, cost, size, weight all these things. And some of the other areas we have the larger capacity by factor. So part of this is, you got to be creating value right and then if you do that and on top of that you execute and you get out and so forth and you're going to get value.","There is also just of course the natural factor, the mixed piece is that, the different segments have natural different levels of margin, right. So but crypto currency side, well of course consumer to the extent that we play is more price challenges, more margin leanness other places that we play in aerospace and defense for instance so forth and in general if you're delivering value you can get the value. So on the one hand I would agree with you is that, I think with our innovation and what we're doing that we're getting value and we're giving value to the customers, but you know the variability does become when you have certain markets if they pick up very strongly and they're naturally in that market have more ASPs competitive and you know that can change mix. But we certainly think that with leadership and the products and continue to innovation that in generation we can and will get good solid gross margin. They always have that variability and then of course.","Lorenzo Flores","The gross margins are just to remind you all John, I know we've had this conversation before. It's not reflective only of one quarter shift in mix. There is a decade now long legacy of focus on improving the gross margin of the company and our approach to it, I think it does provide us with a solid basis for just as Victor said consistently strong expectations on gross margin. But we're in very competitive markets in the lot of places and in markets where by the nature of those markets you're under consistent cost pressure. So yes while we have a firm basis saying we're keep growing it, I think it's probably a little aggressive.","John Pitzer","And Lorenzo, what specifically this quarter about mix was such a tailwind.","Lorenzo Flores","So we had actually the benefit from Victor and Moshe both mentioned our advanced product growth particularly our newer products which happened to be the highest value products we can provide, those provided and uplift and we also had good business in the general, in the industrial and aerospace, defense test measurement and emulation end markets which generally provide an uplift for our margin structure.","John Pitzer","Thanks a lot, very helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Reading off my carefully crafted questioned script. Can you fill us in on what percent of overall revenues came from automotive and how much automotive was that year-over-year?","Lorenzo Flores","Auto was up year-over-year on the order of a little more than 20%, but I think that's a little bit of measurement anomaly. We had somewhat of a low point last year this quarter in auto and we are seeing it still in around 7%-ish of overall sales. Most of that business again is ADAS related and most of the growth is ADAS and Zynq based for us going forward.","David Wong","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","John Vinh","Good luck to you, Moshe and Victor, congrats on your new role. My question is around comms last night you heard TI kind of call it out as a source of area of weakness that they're seeing. It looks like comms where you came in, maybe slightly below what you're expecting but you did guide comms to be up in March, so wondering if you could give us some color in terms of what sort of demand trends you're seeing there and also if you could comment on what you're seeing between wireless and wireline, that will be great.","Victor Peng","Sure. So wireless is actually up some. I think we've mentioned several times that we're virtually all of the pre-5G prototyping so we saw some growth there. We also saw some strength in 4G deployments in India. Wired slowdown some mainly due to some of deployment of some products, but when we look at the current quarter we see that wired will be back up and wireless will probably be about flattish.","John Vinh","Got it. Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","It's not inconsistent with what we've been saying, wireless will bounce around this level until we see the 5G inflection point.","John Vinh","Great. Thanks and I had a follow-up question on M&A. it seems like M&A activity is starting to pick up and seem really with the tax reform ability to repatriate cash seems like activity in the sector could pick up. One does that give you an opportunity to be a little bit more proactive on the M&A front. And can you also remind us in terms of how much offshore cash you will have an opportunity to repatriate.","Lorenzo Flores","So let me take the more specific the cash question, first. I think Victor can elaborate on the market situation for M&A. the easiest way to think about it right now is, after we pay the transition tax which for the most part is a book number because the structure is deferred over eight years. Pretty much our cash balance is free to move about the world. So that's part of this assessment that we're doing overall so gross cash at $3.6 billion net cash of $1.9 billion. We don't foresee limitation on [indiscernible] deploying that cash anywhere in the world or seeing any sort of tax penalty for doing it. We'll have ongoing tax which on a cash basis will be higher than we've experienced in the past, but there won't be restrictions on cash utilization or maybe better put economic disincentive to use it anywhere. So that's a good news part of tax reform for us.","Victor Peng","On the M&A side I viewed as our focus is what is our strategic objective and goal and M&A could be a tool to sort of further add, so we look at it that way and we obviously consider that as along with other many option. Ultimately of course you want to maximize shareholder value that the financial sectors is the main goal. But I would say that the focus is to think about what all our options are in the strategic concepts and we're trying to accomplish and if M&A is the thing then that would be considered along with that option. Now clearly on this call, this isn't the time to talk about that kind of vision. I think there will be time later in the quarter where we'll have the opportunity to talk a little bit more about direction in vision.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Also I want to echo the congratulations to Moshe and Victor. Just wanted to follow-up on the end market splits. You guys have done a great job growing for I think it's nine consecutive quarters on a sequential basis and the annual guidance range, is you've given been very helpful and it sounds like you're going to beat those for this fiscal year but there is some pretty big deltas between what you guided by segment and what you delivered with the comms and data center side being well below your guidance but the industrial, aerospace and defense being well above. So I guess with that all being said the question is what was surprising in those two segments versus what you originally thought and what's the duration of the new trajectory. You think it's phased this week on one side and strong in the other or is something in the mean revert [ph].","Lorenzo Flores","So versus where we thought I think you've gotten the primary point which are the industrial and A&D that have been markets which includes true industrial, aerospace and defense and test measurement and emulation. We're very pleasant surprise with their strength this year and that's pretty much across the board in those end markets. The consumer automotive and broadcast sentiment markets is on track with maybe automotive not as strong as we initially thought, but as I said earlier still growing in ADAS applications and so good platform for us in the future. And the wireless, wired communications data center end market that is underperformed partially because wired and data center is not a strong collectively as we thought and then wireless was bouncy and tough to predict to being with. But as we go forward, without being very specific about the direction like I said we'll provide more of that later on this year. The characteristics that are driving industrial and A&D seemed to be sustainable.","The consumer automotive and broadcast business as we talked about, we could see some good upside from the, as we talk about it now from applications like the crypto currency and we look to maintain our position in automotive. Wireless, we still think is going to have that same basic characteristic of flattish with up and downs until we see the 5G and wired and data center I think we're going to continue to slow growth.","Victor Peng","Can I just? I'm not going - I do want to add a little just to certain applications. A&D has been strong that is not a surprise frankly I think that is something that is something that's been strongly and we definitely see that continue and test measure and emulation. I think we expect to be strong maybe is a little stronger than we expected, but I wouldn't say it's a surprise. I think some of the other comments that Lorenzo shared we agree, but I mean overall I don't want you to think that some of these things we didn't anticipate I just happens that a lot of the growth sell in that single bucket right, if you break it down as Lorenzo said there is good growth in multiple sub segments.","I would also say that in general if we're talking about by segments. We talked also about the fact that I mentioned in my remarks I think is also a very strong platform I see that strengthening across multiple market. So I think there are definitely areas where we've been seeing and we see that sustained.","Ross Seymore","That's helpful color. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird.","Tristan Gerra","I'll join my peers and congratulate both Moshe on many years of significant achievements and also Victor on your new role. Regarding 5G is it fair to assume that this ramp is going to be more small cells based versus base station based and so as such should we view 5G as potentially being more of a higher unit but lower [indiscernible] content opportunity and perhaps if you could refresh us a little bit on when you think the ramp beyond field test can become more meaningful overtime.","Victor Peng","Let me and answer that last part first. So I think we've been pretty consistent in saying we really see the ramp more in the 2020 timeframe. I mean there is some early things going on now and we've got like approximately 90% of those early pre-5G and proof of concepts and then I also referred to really disruptive product in the RFSoC but of course that's just getting out. Now it's a transition to the first part of your answer is that? let me start with RFSoC in that regard, I mean RFSoC is something that is something that is not just 5G, it's the right technology and really the way to deal with any massive MIMO kind of architecture so that's a very large [indiscernible] and that's a trend that's being moved to across in general not only in wireless infrastructure but even in other very adjacent applications, right.","And then in terms of small cells. Yes in small cells but I think that it's really a range of different types of infrastructure so I wouldn't say that it's just small cells. So in general I would say we see good very strong position there but again the ramp is more in the 2020 timeframe and as far as RFSoC we're seeing great momentum, but it's really not a meaningful revenue at this point. People are just starting to design with that, that goes into production in this calendar year.","Tristan Gerra","Okay great and then just a quick follow-up. So it looks like the tens of millions of revenue target that you had for this fiscal year for [indiscernible] potentially gets pushed out a little bit, how should we look at the ramp, is there a timing at which we see more [indiscernible] inflection point and any quantification that you may want to put forward for the next year or two from a data center and this customer.","Victor Peng","I'm sorry were you referring to the tens of millions on being pushed out, could you?","Tristan Gerra","I think that was a somewhat of soft target that Xilinx had put in place regarding this fiscal year in terms of data center ramp.","Victor Peng","Okay, I see I mean again what I would say is that, first of all data center. The traditional portion of our data center revenue right, the kinds of deployments we've been in the past largely in storage, but not only in storage that still is actually the larger part of the revenue overall. I think the revenue is the emerging part that we referred to and I think what you're probably really targeting early the discussion about FAS and so forth. I mean that's, that is in the smaller number that you're talking about, now it's still in those tens of millions, I don't see this as a push out. I think we've been pretty much consistent in saying that, this is the period where we're building applications, we're getting the tools and the infrastructure out there, we're building an ecosystem and so forth. Just to put this in perspective in the re:Invent Conference that Amazon had back in November 2016, that's when they announced and they were the first ones to announce FPGA as a Service. They actually announced it, but it didn't even start going online until April, 2017 since that time we now have five announced FAS deployments, but again many of them are just coming online.","In the re:Invent Conference Amazon just had this past November. They announced the fact that they have now instead of just one region, there are three region which FPGA accelerated or deployed including the secure US GovCloud and I think a total of 11 [indiscernible] regions. So I think what I'm trying to suggest here is that, it is not at this stage where we're talking about big revenue growth. This is all about building the applications, the infrastructure, getting the deployments and we're seeing very good momentum on that perspective. I don't see that there is a push out per se, I think it's just again building that the foundation and getting the applications out and getting these engagements going. Does that [technical difficulty]?","Tristan Gerra","Great. Very useful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","And again my congrats to Moshe as well. If you could help us understand the commentary on crypto it will be helpful. Specifically you're saying you think it's more durable or maybe [indiscernible] sustainable, is there something about your position in that market or demand trends that you think reflect something that indicates sustainability in that marketplace. Thank you.","Victor Peng","The crypto currency is extremely volatile and so I think one in some situations what happens is, that things change so much that A; it's hard in that sense to sort of predict. In terms of the sustainability though we do see as we said, we do see that we've had revenue in the low tens of millions, we see that kind of level of revenue continuing, but we also are providing support for these customers. Okay, it's not secret there's so much involved there that people doing custom ASICs for this and they're also using GPUs. Now the reason why we do see some flip here is because it's a very dynamic situation to a different and Bitcoin gets a lot of press, but really there is multiple different currencies and there is lot of things happening, so with that kind of change the flexibility we have that has that value. But we are very cautious here because of the volatility of it and we don't want to you to over read in what we're saying, right? That's why in the TPU space they've had much bigger exposure, but nonetheless it's gotten to the point where we don't want to just have it not lease rate.","Lorenzo Flores","I think the durability point comes from when we first saw it, it was very small business and then it grew significantly but we didn't have any line of sight to any future business path what was currently in the book. We now have better line of sight by working closely with some of these customers to what their plans are and the future potential of the business, that's really what I was going after when I said that because it's something we understand a little bit better, but again as we keep saying we're cautious about the macro factors that drive the core demand for these products.","William Stein","It helped. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso","The question about the revenue turns [ph] percentage that seems to have been steadily dropping is that a function of where product lead times are now, if you could explain that relationship and basically what you're seeing both turns perspective how it gives you visibility for the business before you're seeing lead time.","Victor Peng","We don't really have any lead time issues and actually that's one of the things our customers have appreciated about us, which our ability to support them. I do think it's more function of us continuing to drive the business and get the orders on the book as soon as we can and it does help us plan and it does help us from some downside variability it if ever occurs. We just - trying to drive the business not to say that it will be always be this way but we're making a deliberate effort to get the orders on the book.","Chris Caso","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Moshe thanks for everything over the years. Mazel Tov caim sheli. Anyway. That's Hebrew for those of you who don't know out there. I don't know if you guys. [Foreign Language]. I don't know if you guys went into the relative growth rate you expect in your three main end markets for the calendar years, if you could just run through those real quick.","Victor Peng","I'm sorry, so you said for the calendar year or for the last quarter.","Chris Danely","For this calendar year what's your relative growth rate expectations between comm, industrial and broadcast.","Victor Peng","I don't think that on this call I want to give guidance for the quarter, right. But I mean for the calendar year but in terms of where we see now in the quarter that we're in, the aerospace, industrial, A&D that we definitely see will be a very strong quarter. I mean overall that basket. I think the AVB consumer and auto will be holding slightly up.","Lorenzo Flores","Yes, well so I think Chris so the for the year I mean the calendar year is three quarters over next fiscal year and I guess we'll do that guidance first in at the end of this quarter and then more completely at Analyst Day. But for this current quarter the fourth quarter with respect to the third quarter with what I had reference in my guidance piece earlier.","Victor Peng","Yes, I was talking about the fiscal year. I'm sorry. I was referring to this fiscal year of which sub segments was going to show pretty strong growth.","Lorenzo Flores","Yes, so I got I think we're both little bit confused about the time and horizon your question, sorry about that. But for this quarter the industrial, aerospace and defense end market set will be relatively flattish as the two industrial and aerospace and defense segment growth offsets decline from actually a record setting performance on test measurement and emulation. The communications and data center end markets will be up slightly and the consumer automotive and broadcast business will be up and that's where the right now we've bucketed the crypto currency business and that's where we spent a little bit more time explaining that.","Victor Peng","And that's for the quarter.","Lorenzo Flores","For the quarter, yes.","Victor Peng","Sorry, I thought you were saying when we complete the fiscal year, how it would look?","Chris Danely","Yes, I'll wait for the long-term guidance for the analyst day.","Lorenzo Flores","Okay, yes great thanks.","Chris Danely","Thanks guys.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International.","Christopher Rolland","Congrats Victor on the promotion and congrats Moshe on a great career. So I just Victor wanted clarification first. So you said low tens of millions from crypto was at per quarter or for the full year and then I assume that's most heavily weighted for this last quarter here. And then also the 30% growth in broadcast consumer and auto, great job there. And I know Dave already asked about auto growth here. But what was consumer growth year-over-year and broadcast growth. Thanks.","Victor Peng","I guess in general in terms of the crypto currency like we said that kind of came from a very low number to in that order of tens pretty quickly, so when you sort of said how was it, was that on a quarterly basis, actually that would be for like the whole year, but you know it kind of came up from a year ago virtually zero. So yes, so the answer to first part is yes. Yes, it is stronger in the recent quarter but you know for the year it's still be in that order of magnitude.","Lorenzo Flores","So the other aspects of the business, the AVB end markets are on the order of 10% up and consumer business is up substantially more but I think again there is some data anomalies that you wouldn't want to use that as a predictor of the future just because the way that business had bounced around historically.","Victor Peng","Again as you know consumers are very in general a more opportunistic one for us, that is in - we definitely when we see certain opportunities go after it on the other hand that doesn't have the kind of emphasis that we have in some of the other markets. And again we flagged the crypto because that became from quickly essentially zero to something that you wanted to flag.","Christopher Rolland","Yes, I certainly understand you don't want to leave anything on the table. Thanks guys.","Victor Peng","Yes, we won't do that.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Just quickly on the balance sheet. Inventories were up a little bit more than I would have thought and so are receivables and so Lorenzo I know you talked about not having any availability issues. Is this just a new norm for inventories, what should we expect going into the March quarter or how should we think about that. Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","In general you will see our inventory grow in anticipation of the business. We've had I think there's one quarter in the past we actually had a higher dollar value of inventory that was for specific business area I think that was getting ready to support wireless ramp and last generation. Again I think that was the case, but we see just in general broader end market strength particularly in our advanced products and that for we're focusing our inventory builds. So I think the inventory number is quite consistent with what you'll see in the business. It should growth as the business grows, but periods it will drain down a little bit and others it will build up a little bit, just depending on what we're actually seeing in the market. On AR, this is been a story that I've told a couple of times it is relatively high and it is again driven by how consumers take shipments and during the quarter and payment patterns. I will reassure you all we have no collectability issues on the AR, so that's just high quality and it's purely a timing thing.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Vinayak calling in for Joe. I wanted to follow-up on your ADAS business. Now that's one space where you have seen good traction for using product. So when you look at your customer design and pipeline, could you just discuss how happy and applications sort of ADAS evolved overtime and what are the applications your most [indiscernible] going forward?","Victor Peng","ADAS again has been as I mentioned for Zynq automotives is one of the areas that we have [indiscernible] strength. For the most part this is all 28-nanometers by the way, right and of course the ADAS requirements for the market keep going up, right they keep raising the safety standard, so there is already been quite a bit activity and design ins for the next generation ADAS. As everybody knows that there is also a lot of development and excitement around autonomous driving and these things are evolving from advanced driver assist systems towards autonomous driving, so we have a natural set of relationships, design activities and in fact some wins frankly that move us along that whole continuum the earlier events driver assist systems to more sophisticated ones to the earlier levels or autonomous driving.","So yes it's I think that we're definitely participating that entire evolution because of our flexibility we're participating in all of the major sub portions of the architecture meaning like we have engagements where we're in the central unit, we have [indiscernible] some of the sensors, aggregation points and so forth. So yes, we're quite well engaged there and think that's one of the definite areas we think out in good, very good traction. First generation in our 16-nanometer MPSoC as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","You have another follow-up question from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","I just want to follow-up on the March guidance for consumer. Given you said your [indiscernible] seems like should be up double digits and obviously we talked about crypto currency. I'm just trying to understand how strong automotive is because that business has had kind of unpredictable path typically it's seasonally strong but sometimes it's up larger if you could just look at the sequential growth in the March and maybe kind of get any color between the segments there.","Victor Peng","That's sort of end market in a percentage basis, the consumer aspect will grow the more substantial as you just pointed out. Both AVB and auto will grow in the low single-digits.","Blayne Curtis","Very helpful. Thanks.","Rick Muscha","Victoria, we can take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. Your last question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Securities.","Srini Pajjuri","Moshe, let me echo my congrats and again thanks for all your help over the years. Just a quick question I know you guys don't make CPUs but you do sit next to a lot of them. Just curious if you know the recent security issues with Meltdown and Spectre and if you're seeing any impact one way or the other, directly or indirectly in the near term. Do you expect any impact from those issues?","Victor Peng","I know that's a quite a lively topic. Of course we lead the industry in integrating in RMSoC into All Programmable FPGA so and as you know we license those cores from ARM. So one is, I'll say that we absolutely know that there is no susceptibilities of the Xilinx specific implementation of the Arm cores that we license from ARM and according to information, we work very closely with ARM. We don't believe there is any susceptibility to the meltdown aspect of it. Regarding Spectre there is no known susceptibility in terms of the 16-nanometer Zynq MPSoC and in terms of the first generation Zynq SoC, we use there the ARM Cortex A-9 which has the possibility of having some of that however I'll point out that, most of our customers do and closed embedded systems. And if that's the case that's highly unlikely that there will be exposure to that.","In addition if the customer does have something to get, gets user kind of code exposure if they use authentication, security features that are there then that exposure is also same thing highly unlikely. We haven't heard anything from customers but of course we monitor that very closely and we're working with ARM very closely on any further news or mitigation. Just to round out the basis, by the way we've had our proprietary Microblaze SoC [ph] embedded processor. We know that there is no vulnerability there in that architecture is very simplistic so there is no vulnerability in either of the Meltdown or the Spectre. Does that?","Srini Pajjuri","Yes. Great. That's it.","Rick Muscha","Great. Well thanks for joining us today. We'll have a playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time, 8 PM Eastern Time today.

After the speaker remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, and then open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks.","These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you, Rick. In the September quarter, Xilinx sales were $579 million, up 1% sequentially and up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first six months of the fiscal year were up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our advanced products increased 10% sequentially and 61% year-over-year, with 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer sales are reaching new records.","Sales from our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family were significant and exceeded our expectations. Our sales in the September quarter demonstrated the resilience of our multi-market model, growth in Industrial and A&D and Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive categories more than offset the expected decline in Communications.","The Industrial and A&D category stood out with strength in test, measurement and emulation, as well as Aerospace & Defense. In fact, sales from test, measurement and emulation reached a record during the quarter. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive was up slightly, better than expected due primarily to strength from AVB.","Gross margin in Q2 was 69.6%, lower than guided due to the impact of a licensing agreement with Rambus. Moving forward, the impact of this agreement is expected to be immaterial to our gross margin. Operating expense was $227 million, lower than guided due to lower compensation expenses. Operating income for the quarter was $177 million or 30.5%.","Other income and expense was an expense of $1 million, lower than guided due primarily to an investment distribution. The tax rate for the quarter was 7%, which included the previously disclosed benefit of $9 million or $0.03 per diluted share related to closure of the audits of fiscal years 2012 through 2014, and a $0.02 per diluted share benefit related to other discrete tax items.","Our net income for Q2 was $164 million or $0.61 per share. Operating cash flow was $184 million. Diluted shares were 270 million, including 14.8 million from the convertible, higher than guided due to the impact of our higher share price. We repurchased 1.9 million shares for $100 million and we paid $84 million in dividends.","Now some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion in net cash after our debt. Inventory was $197 million, approximately flat with the prior quarter and down $16 million from the same quarter a year ago.","As I turn to our guidance, I would like to refresh the key points of the annual guidance from our Analyst Day in May. At the Analyst Day, we forecasted our revenue growth to be between 4% and 8%, our gross margin to be between 68% and 70%. And our operating expense to be between $930 million and $950 million. Our performance for the first two fiscal quarters, our guidance for Q3 and our expectations for Q4 indicate that we remain centered in the range of the guidance provided at our Analyst meeting.","In the December quarter, we\u2019re expecting sales to be flat sequentially. Our backlog is slightly down heading into the quarter. We expect advanced products will continue to grow and we are expecting communications to increase with growth in both wireless and wired.","Industrial and A&D is expected to decline as test and measurement comes off of two consecutive record quarter. Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive is expected to be approximately flat sequentially. Our gross margin will be approximately 69%. For operating expense, we continue to invest in accelerating our leadership position as discussed at our Analyst Day. We expect to see operating expense increase to approximately $245 million with a significant portion of the increase coming from tape-out expenses.","Our operating expense outlook includes $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $2 million, and will likely approximate this level again in Q4. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be 14%.","Now, I\u2019d like to say a few words on our capital allocation strategy. We are confident in our long-term growth strategy and expect to continue to generate healthy cash flows. Note our operating cash flow from year-to-date exceeds $500 million. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same: invest in our business to capitalize on our leadership position and return of capital to our shareholders with a commitment to an increasing dividend over time and through share repurchases.","With respect to share repurchases, as we previously announced in May of this year, the Xilinx\u2019s Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Our plan is to take a more deliberate approach on share repurchases with the intention of exhausting the $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Lorenzo. I\u2019m very pleased with the financial results of the second quarter. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, resulting in operating profit in excess of 30% for the third consecutive quarter. Our overall revenue growth was, as in the previous quarter, driven by our Advanced Products. These increased again by over 60% year-over-year, delivering yet another significant quarterly record and now account 46% for our total sales.","Overall, five of our eight end-markets grew in the quarter demonstrating the robustness of our diversified multimarket portfolio. Our unparalleled execution on the 28-, 20- and 60-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generation of very significant technology leadership. Our world-class partnership with TSMC, the foundry technology and market leader has been key to the success.","In the September quarter, for the fourth consecutive quarter 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. 28-nanometer sales growth was enabled by our Zynq product line, which is a significant component of our market expansion efforts. Zynq product sales increased 25% sequentially, driven by automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications.","20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level very significantly exceeding our $40 million target. Sales were driven by strong contributions from our test and measurement, wired and wireless markets. We expect to ship over $50 million of 20-nanometer products in December quarter. 60-nanometer sales grew significantly in the September quarter, similarly exceeding our forecast, while shipping to a broad-base of end markets, including automotive, data center and communications.","At our Analyst Day in May, we discussed the strategic increase in our R&D investment in fiscal year 2017 to both solidify our leadership position and expand our product portfolio. We recently highlighted two significant accomplishments that demonstrate the early fruits from that investment decision.","First and foremost, we reached ahead of schedule a critical production milestone with our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ portfolio, further extending our product lead to well beyond the year. We\u2019re already shipping nine unique revenue generating products to approaching 200 active customers. Per Lorenzo\u2019s earlier comment, we expect to deliver multiple production tape-outs in the current quarter to solidify this lead.","In addition, we announced the expansion of our cost optimized Spartan, Artix and Zynq 28-nanometer product families, targeting a wide range of applications including Embedded Vision and Industrial IoT.","We recently made two announcements illustrating our significant momentum in cloud computing, another of our key emerging market expansion opportunities. Baidu has adopted Xilinx to accelerate machine learning applications in the data center and will leverage our platforms in their initiatives to develop commercially-viable autonomous cars.","In addition, the CCIX technology consortium, formed to bring a high-performance open acceleration framework to data centers, tripled its membership, has released the specification to consortium members. We\u2019re uniquely positioned to capitalize on our excellent execution, and innovative and game changing products to both accelerate share gains and drive market expansion.","We remain committed to maintaining and extending our leadership, while delivering to our long-term operating margin targets of 30% plus, and per Lorenzo\u2019s earlier comments, underlying our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Q - John Pitzer","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Lorenzo, in your prepared comments, it sounds like you\u2019re still on target to hit that 6% growth guidance for the fiscal year. I hate talking about seasonality, because there\u2019s so much variance around seasonality.","But given the guide for the December quarter, that kind of implies the March quarter up about 6% versus, seasonal up 3%. I wonder if you guys can just talk about if there is anything specific you\u2019re seeing maybe around the F35 revenue stream or any other sort of new product revenue stream that gives you confidence as you look out that far that that you have that kind of above seasonal growth?","Lorenzo Flores","Yeah, so thanks, John. Obviously, as we close this quarter and we go into Q4, we\u2019ll be providing you with more specifics. But I think right now, what we will tell you that underneath our view of Q4, of our fiscal Q4, is a view that communications will be firming and we will see growth in the Industrial and A&D category as well as the Consumer, Automotive and Broadcast category; some for the reasons you\u2019re alluding to, but there is more there than that.","John Pitzer","Got it, and then, as my follow-up guys, Moshe, the Baidu announcement was a nice announcement around acceleration. I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand kind of the opportunity there. Are you sitting next to Intel processors? And then how do we think about the acceleration sort of a growth developing in the near-term, because our thought process was that was perhaps going to be more a 2018, 2019 event relative to the Analyst Day you guys had earlier in the year? It seems like you\u2019re getting some of that earlier.","Do you expect to see sort of additional follow-on here or is this going to be still something you expect it to mature in the next couple of years instead of the next couple of quarters?","Moshe Gavrielov","John, it\u2019s next couple of years, it\u2019s not the next couple of quarters. We believe that this has the potential of being $200 million to $300 million by 2020. And it will have to grow to that number. It\u2019s not going to happen overnight and it won\u2019t happen over the next six months. It\u2019s going to take more than six months just for these devices to go into volume production. So this is a - as most of our businesses, this grows a little faster, but it still will take time and will take several years till it gets to the several hundreds of millions of dollars.","So the - let\u2019s put it this way, this will not generate the Q4 upswing that you asked about earlier.","John Pitzer","Okay. Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good results.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure, thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you very much. I had a question on the share buyback. And I\u2019m not very clear, to me at least, Lorenzo, what you meant by a more deliberate approach on the buyback. And I have a quick follow-up after that, please.","Lorenzo Flores","Sure. So I think we\u2019ve had questions over the past few months after we announced the Board\u2019s authorization of an additional $1 billion in May, about what our plans are. And I think in the past we\u2019ve characterized our approach to share repurchases as opportunistic, which is fairly ambiguous. What we\u2019re trying to communicate is we have the intent to utilize the authorization over - and I chose the word several - next several quarters deliberately to indicate a rather more defined time-span on when we\u2019re going to utilize the authorization.","Ambrish Srivastava","Okay. And then a quick follow-up, Moshe, on the nodes, 16-nanometer, where is the difference in this node versus what you\u2019ve seen in the past? And Intel just announced their product and they said that they would be shipping for revenues. So just help us understand kind of where you are in terms of being I think over a year ahead versus them, and then what kind of opportunities does it open for you. And if we\u2019re just going back to the last nodes it\u2019s clear at least to us that it opens up like a 65-35 kind of market share. So any help on the opportunity you\u2019re seeing versus the last node will be great. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure, Ambrish. So we taped it out in June of 2015. It came back in September of 2015. It was in such pristine condition that at that point in time we were able to demonstrate devices working and achieving the specs, which for silicon immediately in the first day is as good as it gets and probably better than nearly everyone else. And we sampled the parts to our customers and we have been shipping them to numerous customers in a whole host of applications. And the feedback we\u2019re getting is between the software, the silicon and IP customers have never seen from anyone anything at this level of functionality.","And as a result what we have done is we now have nine products that are shipping. And we\u2019re moving into production and part of the bump that is happening this quarter, the current quarter we\u2019re in, in terms of R&D and the quarter after that will be a whole slew of tape-outs, which indicate that we\u2019re going to move into production at an early point.","So in terms of sampling, we believe we are clearly a year ahead in terms of the maturity of the product and from what we\u2019re hearing from our customers we\u2019re much more than that. And that\u2019s position we\u2019re in, it\u2019s a very enviable position. And that\u2019s why we are increasing our investment to exploit it. Hopefully, that answers your question.","Ambrish Srivastava","Yeah, thank you, Moshe. Good luck.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe on the automotive side, can you remind us what\u2019s driving that growth today? And then turning to this autonomous driving agreement with Baidu, is that expected to drive Xilinx units in the vehicles, so for scoring or inference? Or is it more on the deep learning side, not so much on the client side?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So our automotive business historically was more on the entertainment side. And our Zynq product offering was defined specifically to address driver assistance. And that is a huge step towards delivering autonomous vehicles. What is happening now is the part that is growing is the advanced driver assistance. And we actually shared that we expect to have 85 models in production in this year. And we remain on target for delivering those 85 models.","If you noticed, I had mentioned that quite a bit of our early revenue on 16-nanometer was in automotive and that comes from the second generation of our Zynq product, which is the MPSoC. It\u2019s a more powerful element.","Now, in parallel to that as being in a pull position for this market, we are working on the next generation, which is the 7-nanometer product. And there, we expect that as the world moves from driver assistance to autonomous driving, we expect it to move in phases. There are question marks with regards to how quickly it will happen. There is a whole host of barriers with regards to safety security and legislation that will modulate and throttle that growth.","And so, we believe that a lot of the work is being done now and there has been a lot of early deployment. And what we\u2019re seeing is that that market is expanding beyond the traditional suppliers, beyond the tier 1 providers to those suppliers and there is a whole host of new players who are entering the market in addition and are deploying technologies which they have developed for their data center applications.","And so, we expect this to continue to unfold to be honest over the next 10 years. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to all happen tomorrow. We do think there is going to be lot of proof of concepts and very limited deployments over the next year or two. But we think that the massive volume will actually come in the 7-nanometer in the 2020 and beyond timeframe. And there will be a lot of different approaches. We believe that our technology and our solutions will be relevant to most, if not, all of those target, right.","And there is quite a bit of fragmentation, there are a lot of different approaches there. But our technology fundamentally should be very viable to address all of those. And our early position with ADAS, gives us good understanding and good relationship to - with the providers to address that market.","William Stein","Thanks for the color.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya","Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, this is sort of a longer-term question. The promise of FPGAs has been that there is a very long life to current generation and legacy products. And then you lay around growth from next generation, so certainly your next generation as growing at a very phenomenal pace. But when I look at your legacy or core products they are declining at a mid-teens pace or so. Is that different from what you\u2019ve observed in the past i.e., that the core products are declining faster than they had in the past or am I not looking at this the right way?","Moshe Gavrielov","No. You are looking at it right. And those numbers are difficult to argue with. I would say that first quarter effect is, are you winning or you not winning at a certain node. And to be honest, the decline in the old product is because there is two significant generations where we did not do well, right. And if you look at the 40-nanometer, at the high-end we were late, where the product had some issues. And prior to that, there was also a generation, which had its challenges.","And so as a result that is now declining at a fast rate. The good news is now we have three nodes in a row, that we have had great execution and significant market share. And because it takes a long time, and you are absolutely right in that, it takes time for that to compensate for the old node.","The good news is once you get to 50%, right, and we are very close to that 50%, then you have a bigger, a much stronger tailwind, and the headwind is diminishing. And so, what you should see is the percentage which has the tailwind is growing now at a faster rate and will soon reach magnitude that it can compensate, and actually more than compensate for the products which are not growing.","And so your analysis is correct. But I think you need to take that first order impact is, did you have a good node or not have a good node. If you have three good nodes in succession and our recent nodes, then once that gets to 50% of the revenue that should more than compensate for the shrinkage of the old portion.","Vivek Arya","Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, when I look at the growth rate that Intel has given for Altera, I understand that they are not having too many details. But they are saying it\u2019s about similar to what you\u2019re targeting, it is about 6%, right, or so. So is it that it is too early for us to see your share gains at some of these new nodes, because if you have been gaining so much share at 28 and then 16, and at 20-naometers, why isn\u2019t Xilinx growing faster than the growth rate that Intel has mentioned around Altera? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Yeah. It\u2019s very difficult for me to answer that question. And it\u2019s even more difficult for me to answer it, as they\u2019re part of a very large company with a lot of things going on. And so, what I would say is we believe in the 6%, we need to deliver the 6%, if they deliver 6% or higher, good for them. We need to deliver 6%. All of the published numbers with regards to new nodes show that Xilinx share at 28 is well over 60% at 20 is significantly higher than that, and obviously at 16, 14, right. We are in terms of shipments for revenue we have all of the shipments for revenue at this point and we have over a year lead.","So I think we\u2019re in a good position and that position has strengthened over the past three generations. And we now believe that that is at the root of enabling us to deliver 6% growth and the comparisons are going to be more difficult in the future.","Vivek Arya","Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned 25% sequential growth in Zynq and you mentioned autos first. Just curious if you could give any primers as to how big auto is getting within that bucket or maybe what that business is growing for the fiscal year?","Lorenzo Flores","I\u2019m sorry, Blayne. When you say what that business are you referring to auto or was it\u2026?","Blayne Curtis","You said - autos were the first one you mentioned so I was curious if you could give any color as to how big auto is getting within that segment and what that may grow for the fiscal year.","Lorenzo Flores","I think last time I got tangled up in the Zynq and the auto. So auto, again the dynamic in auto is we are seeing the decline in the older line business, which is infotainment, and the growth in the ADAS part of the market which is driven by Zynq. In aggregate, the automotive business for us is around 7% or 8% of our overall business. We think that will grow overtime as the ADAS growth rate outpaces the decline in the infotainment part of the business.","Blayne Curtis","Got you. And I was just curious, your perspective on the wireless market, a decline in September, but then slight growth. Just curious just - what you think the end-market is doing and whether you\u2019re benefiting from any share gains?","Lorenzo Flores","Well, what we see in terms of the end-markets are the customers we have, have been doing relatively well with, I don\u2019t think I would call it strength. I would call it stabilization; in the China market and growth in India, both contributing to our year-over-year growth.","Now, we had - we\u2019ve said this before, we had a relatively poor year last year in wireless. Again, aggregate though this year we\u2019re expecting the overall segment to grow little less than 10%. But what we\u2019re seeing right now through the year is not unexpected for us, which is it will be up and down throughout the year a few million dollars a quarter. But again getting to a place where we show year-over-year growth.","So it\u2019s going to be a few million dollars of cycling in and out each quarter. We were down last quarter from Q1. We expect to be up in the third quarter from the second quarter. So that\u2019s not unexpected from what we had looked at for the year in wireless.","Blayne Curtis","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Christopher Danely","Hey, thanks guys. Just first a clarification on the share count. So you said, it\u2019s going to be a little more deliberate. I think your shares are basically the same they were five quarters ago. So is the goal to slowly take the share count down or keep it flat overtime?","Lorenzo Flores","The share count should go down. I think, if you\u2019re - and Chris, you need to always keep into account when you\u2019re looking at our diluted shares, the impact of the convertible that we have, which will obviously increase the diluted shares if our share price goes up. So overall though, we\u2019re tending to bring the share count down.","Christopher Danely","Yeah. Okay, great. And then, just another clarification on the data center opportunity, Moshe, you had a question on Baidu earlier and you said $200 million to $300 million by 2020, is that just Baidu alone or is that total data center?","Moshe Gavrielov","No, that\u2019s total data center.","Christopher Danely","Okay, great.","Moshe Gavrielov","And we already have - we have two in production. We expect to have five in production in a year or two, five of the major seven in production.","Christopher Danely","And still on track for the tens of millions of revenue next year?","Moshe Gavrielov","Yes.","Christopher Danely","Great, thanks, guys.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","David Wong","Thanks very much. Can you give us an idea of what your total Zynq revenues in dollars are at the moment?","Moshe Gavrielov","We\u2019re [indiscernible] looking it up.","Lorenzo Flores","Yeah. I just want to make sure. In aggregate Zynq will be between 6% and 8% of our overall revenue.","David Wong","Okay, great. And what functions are the Xilinx chips typically used for in ADAS? And what\u2019s your dollar potential per car?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So the way to look at it is we just talked about the 8%, right, which is automotive, over 50% of that 8% is in ADAS. And those - right, so let use 5%, right. So we are looking for the year, if you look at our target it\u2019s about $120 million for the year, give or take, which will come from ADAS. So lot more than that if you look at all automotive. And this is spread over 85 models. The devices typically are used at the high-end and mid-range, but now are spreading down. And they are in the tens of dollars per unit.","David Wong","Okay, great. Thanks.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian Ing","Yes. Thank you. Just a question on the gross margin guidance, obviously going to the midpoint of the full year expectation, 69%, it is down 60 basis points sequentially at the midpoint. Mix is slightly less favorable. And the Rambus licensing headwind is going away. So just I\u2019m just trying to understand the trend there to get to that guidance.","Lorenzo Flores","Are you talking specifically about Q3, Ian?","Ian Ing","Your Q3, yes.","Lorenzo Flores","Yeah, so I think, if you look at my end-market discussion, where we talked about communications strengthening, we have a wireless element to that. And the test and measurement part of the business coming off of record-highs. You can rationalize the mix down on gross margin.","Ian Ing","Great.","Lorenzo Flores","There are other factors obviously, but if you - that\u2019s the most kind of straightforward way to look at it in terms of mix.","Ian Ing","Okay, great. And just a question here, obviously, it\u2019s a period of elevated 16-nanometer investments, a lot of new parts in each of the families. I\u2019m just trying to understand, I mean, how confident that you are that each part that is being defined can generate some pretty good ROI? Is each of these parts sort of addressing a specific application in a top customer and do you see almost like tailored parts now in terms of resources?","Moshe Gavrielov","Yes, the parts are - if you look at the entire family, there are lots of family members. And what we try to do is to make sure that the mix of resources addresses the different needs of each of the market. If we had perfect planning and vision of what the customers really would need as opposed to what they tell us they need, then I would tell us we are doing great.","Based on our experience you look back and then you find out that some have overachieved and some have underachieved. But we do try to target the different requirements. And sometimes we get it more right and wrong. But it\u2019s not a perfect science and it\u2019s not necessarily because our ability to predict is impaired. The customers\u2019 need tend to change and what we find is that they end up requiring different mix and higher performance et cetera.","And so, that\u2019s the beauty of our business and that we have this whole range of products. So if we miss it on one, we can typically get it on the larger one, albeit sometimes it comes at a margin cost to address the specific market requirements.","Ian Ing","Okay. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Vinay [ph] calling in for Joe. I wanted to follow up on the Industrials and A&D segment. And can you just talk about now what kind of visibility do you have in that segment? And more importantly, how should we think about the long-term growth trajectory for the different buckets in that segment?","Lorenzo Flores","Okay. So this is a really mixed category for us in light of the elements which you\u2019re thereafter. Then in certain cases with very large customers, and large and more public deals like the Joint Strike Fighter in A&D, we have fairly good visibility up until the actual letting of the purchase orders on when you can see the business. But in general, we can map those over time.","Test and measurement to a large degree, with some customer concentration, we know we\u2019re doing extremely well there based on our leadership products, it\u2019s just unmatched. There is no competition for the capability we bring there. And so we have relatively good visibility to the program health. What we actually can be positively surprised by in that area is the success of our customers, as their platforms win in the market.","Industrial is a lot of customers for us. And so, what we are typically doing is looking at a few specific opportunities with customers, and then looking at an aggregation on the broader customer base and seeing what we behave there. So each of these actually has relatively strong growth prospects, kind of defined by the markets they serve. Industrial as we said before driven by the Industrial Internet of Things and platform adoption will be broad based and grow, but at the nature of that business is more slowly over time.","A&D has actually been a relative bright spot for us. We continue to win broadly and designed outside of the Joint Strike Fighter and the Joint Strike Fighter follow-on technology insertions, and so we\u2019re seeing a lot of broader program strength there. In test, measurement and emulation, what you will see is that our leading products would gain share and grow relatively rapidly. And then will be filled in by other elements of that category like semiconductor test business as that broadens our footprint.","So again it\u2019s a very complex category for us to provide one answer to. Hopefully, I gave you some color.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. From a follow-up I want to talk about 5G, you talked about 5G build starting in 2018 timeframe. But can you provide us an update there in terms of what are you hearing from carriers in terms of roadmap and more importantly, what does that mean for you in terms of content opportunity?","Moshe Gavrielov","So 5G, the market has changed quite a bit and up to a couple of years ago. It looked like it was going to get pushed out. And definitely the standard is not quite stable and isn\u2019t complete yet. So there is quite a bit of work that still needs to be done to come up with the standard. But what we have seen over the past two years is that all of the major players have shifted to a desire to be first and have significant market share. And we\u2019re seeing them all race.","And we believe that our 16-nanometer portfolio and our 20-nanometer portfolio is being used in close to 100% of the early prototypes, which are being used to demonstrate the technology.","What we do expect is that the massive deployment will start in 2020 onward. And that the initial deployments, between now and 2020 are happening and they will - there is various flavors, 4.5, 4.9; there is the whole host of numbers which are being thrown around; pre-5G, 5G prototypes.","But we are in a good position for all of those, but we can tell just based on technology position, but we do believe that the massive deployment will be 2020 and onward with the combination of programmable devices. And then for some of the companies they will definitely over time design ASICs to address that market. As it stabilizes and as the standards become clearer and the market requirements become clearer. Hopefully, that helps.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Hi, guys. I have one question and one housekeeping item as a follow-up. And the main question, pulling the wireless incomes back to a little bit of a near-term timeframe, generally, what gives you confidence both the wireless and the wireline business will grow both in the December and March quarters?","They\u2019ve been notoriously lumpy over the last couple of years. And so I\u2019m a little surprised that you\u2019re confident in sequential growth in both of those quarters. So any color you could give there would be helpful.","Lorenzo Flores","Yeah, I mean, the straightforward answer is on wired we actually have seen the design-wins, that I think we\u2019ve alluded to several times in the past, actually beginning to ramp. Obviously, there is some aggregate macro CapEx uncertainty that could impact that. But underneath what\u2019s going on in the industry that the products we\u2019re in, OTN and GPON, we tend to seeing those ramp with infrastructure build-out internationally and domestically is happening.","But you\u2019re right, that can be lumpy. And wireless, again, I\u2019ll go back to the answer I said earlier. We have actually visibility into our customers\u2019 demand on us and their view on what they need to build out in particularly in China and in India on 4G and then the pre-5G business that Moshe referenced just a second ago internationally, North America included, that\u2019s what we see.","Ross Seymore","Great. And then I guess just a one housekeeping one back to the share repurchase plan that you talked about. Just any color you could give, Lorenzo, on the percentage of the $3.5 billion in gross cash that you have that\u2019s held onshore and what percentage of ongoing free cash flow is generated onshore?","Lorenzo Flores","So the way to answer that is of the $3.7 billion of gross cash, about two-thirds of it is categorized as permanently reinvested offshore. But about a third of the total has been deemed tax covered, I guess if you will, for the United States, so approximately two-thirds is available in the U.S. for use without book tax implications. It will be some cash tax implications on about a third of the total.","Okay, and the mix of it as we generate it overtime, it\u2019s a little dynamic, okay.","Ross Seymore","Did you say two-thirds of it was offshore or one third was offshore?","Lorenzo Flores","Well, it\u2019s - so there is two-thirds of it offshore, but two-thirds of the total are - so half of that two-thirds, so one third of the total. We have basically provided tax provision for domestic purposes. So we could utilize that without having a U.S. tax book consequence.","Ross Seymore","Got it. Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","There is a [little impact for it] [ph], yeah.","Ross Seymore","Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Vinh with Pacific Crest. Your line is open.","John Vinh","Hi, thanks for taking my question. As we look at 4G, it appears that we\u2019re in the kind of the latter stages of kind of the rollout here in China. I think most of the operators in China forecasting 4G CapEx down over the next several years. And obviously in mature markets, it\u2019s probably rolled out.","So as we look forward to 5G, which likely is going to roll out in a few years in 2018, do you think you\u2019ll be able to continue to grow your comps revenues over the next few years or are there other offsets to that?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, 4G indeed has peaked and is no longer growing. But there are still deployments that are happening on 4G. Even in China, there are deployments. There are waves of 4G deployments and they are still going through those. And whenever there are waves you see some growth. On the - India now we are seeing - it\u2019s a smaller market, but we\u2019re seeing - we\u2019ve been fortunate to get the right design wins. And those are being deployed in major way in India.","Our expectation is that there is a level of densification, which is happening even in 4G, part of which we\u2019re benefitting from. And then, we are already benefitting from the 5G early deployment. But that tends to be not huge volumes, but nonetheless it\u2019s nice revenue for us.","So we expect - the takeaway on wireless is we expect it to continue to be choppy. What we are seeing is on wired communications that now is growing at the nice rate and that\u2019s where our technology lead - and that tends to be a less volatile market anyway and that\u2019s where the technology leadership, in particular, initially in 20 and now even in 16 is helping grow our business.","So we do expect communications overall to grow. I don\u2019t expect it to grow as a percentage of our business, generally speaking over the next few years. And it\u2019s been fluctuating between 40% to 45%. And I don\u2019t expect it to grow beyond the 45%. Neither do I expect it to shrink below the 40%.","And that\u2019s sort of the general elements. And from time-to-time, when there will be massive deployment cycles on wireless, it could sort of push it up, but on average, we don\u2019t expect that to change.","John Vinh","Got it, thank you. And my follow-up question is on kind of the Joint Strike Fighter. It seems to be more of a measured ramp this time around versus Phase 1, which was a little bit more lumpy. What is giving you better visibility this time around? And can you talk about kind of the magnitude of the second tranche? And how far through the ramp of Phase 2 are we at this point?","Lorenzo Flores","So we have a little bit better visibility. I think we said before, but it bears repeating that for all of the elements of the second cycle or the cycle we are on now, from the technology insertions. We\u2019ve won all the designs available to us. So that\u2019s how we get this visibility. We do expect it, and actually I\u2019m at a loss right now for the aggregate number, but we can get back to you, but the - this is going to be - our view is it\u2019s going to be spread over, let\u2019s call it, 10 years in terms of the buying patterns and the build out.","And, again, we\u2019ll see actually business from the new technologies. And we\u2019ll also see some of the business from the older technologies in the form of spares, replacements and things like that.","So our visibility, John, is based on the design wins we have and the discussions we\u2019ve had with the government primes, because they need to tell us when they are going to want them and expect to provide business to us. But it is not concentrated, right. That is the definite difference from what we saw in the last phase.","John Vinh","Great. Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","Yeah.","Moshe Gavrielov","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven Smigie","Great. Thanks a lot, guys. Lorenzo, I was hoping you could clarify a little bit on your color about where you are relative to your target model for fiscal year 2017. It sounded like you were saying you guys are tracking at the midpoint of that range. And I just want to clarify that you are saying you are sort of tracking at the midpoint towards the, say, 6% [ph] and 69%, versus saying, yes, we\u2019re still within that range, though it could be a wide variance within that range of growth.","Lorenzo Flores","I think you got it. That\u2019s what I was trying to communicate. Our best view right now is we are in the middle of those ranges.","Steven Smigie","Okay, great, thanks. And then with regard to using FPGAs as accelerators, in the last call you talked about the fact that there would be certain workloads where FPGAs would work well versus GPUs. I was hoping you could go into a little bit more detail about what workloads you see you guys are good at and where you are not good. And has that changed over time since you have gotten in there? Have you found, hey, we are better at some of these things than we initially thought?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, it\u2019s a fast emerging market with a lot of excitement and a lot of invention just happening there. And there is a lot of ways of skinning the cat. You can do it through just using a lot of processers. The issue there is the - a lot of the applications tend to be extremely parallel. And then if you try to do it through processers you can only achieve so much, right, and what typically kills you is the power there.","There is a certain class of applications, which require tremendous amount of floating point and that\u2019s clearly the area, where GPUs have the edge. And Nvidia, in particular, has targeted this market for several years and has established a very good position. And I believe they\u2019re shipping hundreds of millions of dollars. What is clear is that for a whole host of applications, the parallelism inside the FPGAs and, in particular, the fact that it\u2019s dynamically reconfigurable, in other words, you can change the way the programmable logic behaves to adapt to the payloads and what the customer is doing, provides a significant advantage.","And what we are doing is we are focusing on enabling that target market and those sorts of applications to use programmable logic. The key to enabling them to achieve that is actually to abstract the design, because these - if you look at the seven large players, they are not renowned for having FPGA designers, right? They tend to have a lot of software engineers and system engineers, but no - but very small number of FPGA designers.","So at this point, the biggest issue is not in the architecture of the programmable logic. It\u2019s actually in enabling the extraction. So the target users can expand. And that\u2019s what we are focusing on. And as we have a whole range of products, which are called our SDx products, system design products, which are targeted to enable that.","And we believe that those are the key to enabling us to unlocking the potential of the programmable logic. And over the next two to three years, we are going to make tremendous strides to address that and to broaden the set of customers. At this point, we need to do it one by one. And it\u2019s based more on the skill-sets that our customers have, which are limited.","Steven Smigie","Great, thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra","Hi, good afternoon. A quick question on the backlog items for a slight decline. Does that compare with the backlog that you provided a quarter ago, which excluded some customers on which you had good visibility, but were not in the backlog then?","Lorenzo Flores","So, Tristan, yes, we are - as I said, our backlog is slightly down. But we are in very, very analogous situation to where we were last quarter, which is - it looked like the turns requirement was greater than average. But we did have specific visibility into the accounts and the deals we were going to get in this quarter. And we are similarly positioned this quarter.","Tristan Gerra","Okay. And then kind of a higher-level question. There are obviously some very topical scenes in terms of growth in automotive, artificial intelligence, HPC. And at a high level, can you just give us a refresh on your views on why you think FPGA is a better position for any type of parallel processing application relative to GPU architecture, and in terms of growth outlook for the next few years? And what you think is most promising on the FPGA front?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So this could, how long do you have?","Tristan Gerra","Sorry.","Moshe Gavrielov","But, I mean, I\u2019ll try to do it in a couple of minutes which is basically what we have. So at the core of our business is we are a diversified multimarket company. And that actually provides us with significant strength, because markets go up and down. And the fact that we have a lot, shields us from some of that volatility.","As you look at the eight markets we play in, there is now an emergence of new markets which sometimes are part of existing markets that benefits significantly from the parallelism which is inherent in the programmable logic. And wherever you talk about artificial intelligence and that\u2019s clearly an area which is in vogue now, there probably isn\u2019t any architecture out there which is more parallel than programmable logic and has that ability for reconfiguration.","So you can architect an ASSP which is very, very parallel. But then it typically isn\u2019t reconfigurable, right. So if the target application changes or the payload changes then you tend to have a mismatch. And so, as you look at these then clearly data center and automotive fall into emerging applications, which benefit for that inherent parallelism.","And then for each of those you need to have a different approach, but sometimes a similar underlying technology, which is market specific. And if you look at these players, it\u2019s not a total coincidence that the data center companies are now expanding into autonomous driving, right. Because there are technologies which are an extension of what they\u2019re developing that can be deployed there.","And so, we see these areas as expansion plays for us. We try to be very realistic with regards to the growth of those markets. And we gave the number that for us we expect that these expansion plays, generally speaking, in a five year timeframe will enable us to expand by $500 million, right. And those two markets are two of the major ones. And if you look at our comments on data center for Xilinx for it to be $200 to $300 million market and you can see that we believe that automotive can also be a $200 to $300 million dollar market in that general timeframe.","Tristan Gerra","That\u2019s very useful. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","All right, thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah","Yes. Thank you. Sorry, I missed this. But what is the motivation for the, I think, you called it a more deliberate share buyback? Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","So like I said, Romit, when we - in May when the Board was considering increasing the authorization part of the discussion, it was obviously how we would use it. And over the course of the last few months we\u2019ve delivered it more on the use of it. Where we are in terms of aggregate cash, gross cash has been about the same since FY 2014. And then looking forward to our ability to invest in the business support the continually growing dividend and have the strategic flexibility around dealing with the debt that we have in FY 2017 - I mean, sorry, in calendar 2017, 2019 and 2021.","And what then to do in terms of addressing questions we\u2019re getting from our shareholder base in terms of the total capital we have and what our plans for, and our decision was really to be more deliberate about the utilization of the authorization as well as be a little more open in the communication about our plans on doing it. So that we communicate to our shareholders what we are doing and we go off and do it. That\u2019s the broad context of what we did.","Romit Shah","Got it, thank you.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today.

Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Rick, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today.","Sales in the June quarter increased for the seventh consecutive quarter to $615 million, up 1% sequentially and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 8% sequentially to a new record. Gross margin was 68.8%, in line with our guidance. Operating expense was $243 million, also as guided. We are executing to the plan we outlined at our Analyst Day in May.","Operating income for the quarter increased 4% sequentially to $180 million or 29.3% of revenue. The tax rate was 8.2% for the quarter, below our guidance of 10% to 13%, due primarily to a discrete item related to the accounting standard for the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $167 million, or $0.63 per share.","Some key points on the balance sheet and our cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2 billion net cash after our debt. During the quarter, the Company raised $750 million of fixed rate debt at a rate of 2.95% with a seven-year term. We redeemed the remaining balance of $458 million on our convertible debt on June 15.","Operating cash flow was $191 million. During the quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends, and we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for $67 million, at an average price of $65.09. We continue to execute on our share repurchase program with the intention of exhausting our authorization over the next several quarters. We currently have $615 million remaining on that authorization.","We ended the quarter with diluted shares at $266 million, which included the impact of 14 million shares from the convertible and the warrant associated with it. Due to the redemption occurring in mid-June, the full impact on share count will be in the September quarter. For a complete explanation of the impact of these instruments on share count, please refer to our convertible FAQ on our Investor Relations website. Inventory was $215 million, down 12 million from the prior quarter.","On to guidance. In the September quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $605 million and $635 million. We continue to expect growth in our Advanced Products. Regards to end market, we expect the communications category to be down, driven by wireless. Industrial and A&D is expected to be up. And lastly, Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive is expected to be up as well.","Our gross margin will be approximately 69% to 71%. Consistent with the guidance we provided at our Analyst Day, we expect operating expense to increase to approximately $253 million, including $1 million of amortization. Most of this increase will be in R&D. We continue to invest in both our technology and our customer relationships as we expand our leadership in our markets. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 10% and 14%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Lorenzo.","I'm very pleased with our ongoing execution as manifested in our June quarter financial result. We delivered our seventh consecutive growth quarter with sales increasing 1% sequentially to $615 million. Operating profit increased to over 29%, reflecting the strength of our business model.","We continue to benefit from our proven technology leadership of three consecutive node, and its positive implication for our broad multi-market thrust. On the market side, five of our eight end markets increased in the quarter. Special mention is due to our test measurements and emulation business, which delivered record revenue yet again.","In addition, our broad-based channel business was a very noteworthy area of strength. We're delighted to realize the benefits from our expanded and very focused global relationship with Avnet.","As has been a recurring pattern, overall revenue growth was driven by our Advanced Products. This increased by 8% sequentially and 33% year-over-year. This category now represents 52% of our overall revenue, significantly up from 49% last quarter and 42% a year ago. As Advanced Products now comprise over half of our business, it will continue to fuel our growth going forward.","Our 28 nanometer product portfolio sets another significant industry sales record with strong sequential growth from the ISM, TME, broadcast and consumer market. 20 nanometer sales also significantly increased in the quarter, driven by vibrant sales in wireless, primarily for pre-5G deployment.","The largest surge in the June quarter sales was driven by our 16 nanometer portfolio. We continue to receive consistent customer feedback that our exceptional execution of this node has extended out competitively to over 18 month. We are now shipping 22 unique products to more than 530 discrete customers, representing all end market, a substantial increase from last quarter.","I'm delighted with the consistent progress we have made in Xilinx's transformation from the premier FPGA company to one addressing a much broader market through uniquely differentiated All Programmable devices. Great manifestation of this transition is the Zynq platform, a very deliberate multi-market expansion play into the SoC space. Our pro Zynq portfolio, which is implemented in both the 28 nanometer and 16 nanometer node, again delivered a new sales record while almost doubling over the past year. In that vein, we recently began customer sampling of our breakthrough 16 nanometer RFSoC family. This highly disruptive product offers an architectural resolution \u2013 revolution of 5G wireless with integrated RF-class analog technology. It provides both 50% to 75% power and dramatic footprint reduction for future 5G deployments, cable and wireless backhaul applications.","I'm particularly pleased with the Amazon FPGA-as-a-Service F1 deployment that enables cloud-based acceleration. The general access phase targeted for traditional hardware application developers was very successfully launched in mid-April of this year. We're currently working shoulder to shoulder with the AWS team to facilitate the second very significant market expansion phase of this program.","The expectation is that within a month of unique SDAccel technology will be made available to AWS F1 users and will enable the much larger community of software application developers to derive the benefits of FPGA acceleration.","Returning to the here and now, our September quarter guidance of $605 million to $635 million will unquestionably be driven from broad-based growth in our Advanced Products portfolio. We remain focused on achieving the fiscal year 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. In addition, while we continue to invest in our leading technology and market expansion efforts, we remain committed to delivering 30%-plus operating margin exiting this fiscal year.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Please limit your question to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. Your first question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Evercore.","C. J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess, first question. I know it's small part of your business, but one that we're all interested in, the Data Center. Can you provide an update on what you're seeing in FPGA-as-a-Service? And I guess, as part of that, how you're ramping R&D to support that and how we should think about that going forward. Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. Well, this program, which has been ongoing for over a year and a half with Amazon is now online. And since mid-April, I think it was April 19, it was opened up for general availability. The nature of that is that it really targets the traditional hardware FPGA designers. And that's gotten very good reception, and we worked very closely with Amazon and their design team to enable that. But the real potential for this technology, both in terms of the ubiquitous accessibility of the technology, and the \u2013 broadening the set of users, is to move beyond traditional hardware designers and facilitate for software developers and algorithm developers to use the technology.","And we have made the technology, which is an abstraction layer or think of it as a wrapper, an abstraction wrapper on top of our hardware technology now available to Amazon, and that's this SDAccel and this is sort of a journey, it's not one set of technologies. But that is, by far, the most significant portion, and we expect that to be rolled out by Amazon within a month or so.","So, we've developed the technology, we've handed it over to them, and now we're working very closely with them to make sure customers have the best experience possible. As with every new technology, it typically has some teething challenges. And you know this is very advanced technology so it undoubtedly will have that, and we expect to continue to work closely with Amazon over the next six months so that as it broadens its usage, it becomes: A, easier to use; B, has much higher performance and gives the benefit of the parallel processing capability, which is inherent in the FPGA, to the customers so they can use it in their end applications. And everyone's sort of \u2013 I know there's tremendous desire to see this happen overnight, and reality is that this probably will take six months to go through this phase of the software technology deployment and acceptance by the market. And at that point in time, it will clearly have the potential of going viral and expanding in a big way.","With regards to all of the numbers we've given in terms of engineering investment, they already relate to this becoming the highest priority for the Company. So, all of the numbers that Lorenzo and the team shared back in May in New York are the numbers, and it's been done by our existing engineering resource. But it is clearly an area that we are significantly increasing the investments over what it has been in the past. You shouldn't sort of assume that that will impact the overall engineering investment, right? So, it's an issue of prioritizing the resource.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","And I want to expand just a little bit on one aspect of what Moshe said, C. J., which is the investment we're making is primarily on SDAccel, which is intended to be broadly available technology outside of Amazon as well, right? So, this is a horizontal leveraging play as well for us.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Congratulations on the solid results. I guess, Moshe--","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Hey, John, we're having a hard time hearing you. One second.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Is this any better, guys?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah, now it's better. Thank you.","John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Apologies. Moshe, I won't ask about the Data Center opportunity, but I was curious, in your prepared comments, you started talking about some revenue, early revenue for 5G. And so, I guess, I'm just trying to figure out how we should be thinking about the deployment of 5G, both the trial opportunity for you, which is going to start to come, I guess, in a little bit more volume as you exit this year and more so into 2018. And then how you see that 5G opportunity developing when trials eventually move into kind of full deployment in sort of the late 2019, 2020 opportunity. How much revenue do you think you can get out of the trial phase? And then, how do you think about 5G under a full deployment, that revenue opportunity? Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. Well, we agree that 5G, in terms of real deployment, it's a 2020 onward timeframe. And the expectation is the technology needs in order to support 5G, which is a massive expansion in terms of bandwidth and reduction in terms of latency, all of those \u2013 the hardware requirements are huge. And so, the expectation is that this will be a long rollout, but the overall area under the curve will be larger than it has been in previous generations of technology.","And we're seeing now a massive race to use our products, and in particular the RFSoC we believe is a very attractive element which should enable us to capture very significant parts of that early deployment. And then over time, what we'd expect is when you move into the later phases, that will be addressed by our 7 nanometer product offering. And so, we expect both of those to be addressed by our technology and in particular by this integration of the mix signal.","When you look at the overall market, we expect wireless to sort of generally, until 2020, to move sideways, but not at the trough level, somewhere in the middle. And we're sort of seeing this, if you look at our trough and peak levels of wireless, they were \u2013 there's about a 2:1 ratio between the two, and it's now hovering in the middle. And in quarters like the quarter we just reported, actually, wireless went up substantially and was well above that midpoint. And in the current quarter, best we can tell, it's going to go down a little, just below that midpoint. And no, we can't sort of \u2013 that's the nature of this business, we expect it to continue to fluctuate. It's good for us. We expect it to be on average at that level, which is better than most and that's due to the very strong technology position we have.","And that's probably why you're seeing us do somewhat better than probably other traditional players in this market. But to summarize, we expect it to sort of be, on average, moving sideways until 2020. And from 2020, we expect it to sort of get to the previous peak levels. And when there will be rapid deployment, it could be above the peak level, but it won't sort of stay there the whole time. The area under the curve is very substantial, and it's just, the technology requirements are much larger and the density of the MIMO and all of that is really much higher than it has been in the previous generation.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks so much. Can you give us some idea what percentage of your total revenues Automotive made up and what sort of growth you're seeing there sequentially and year-over-year?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. So, our Automotive business is around 7% of our overall business. And it's been driven \u2013 the strength of our Automotive business has been driven primarily by the ADAS applications over the past few years as they've offset the Infotainment legacy business we've had. So, that will be the driver for us in the future.","Let me just see if I have some sort of year-over-year. You think \u2013 our Automotive business over the past few years has grown from less than 5%, in the order of 4% of our business to where it is today. So, it's been one of the fastest growers in our overall suite of end markets, David.","Operator","And your next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Vinayak Rao - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello. This is Vinayak, calling in for Joe. I had a follow-up on your ADAS business. Can you just touch upon the breadth of ADAS applications, where you're seeing traction, as the last diversity of the design wins you have there? And longer term, how do you see your positioning in a full year world (22:01)? Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","So, this is a market we have invested in for several years now, and both \u2013 and what you're currently seeing in terms of our revenue is largely our 28 nanometer Zynq product offering. And we're seeing it, no \u2013 the numbers we had shared is approaching 100 models in just over 25 manufacturers. And we're seeing that continuing, we're seeing the usages of technology. It's sort of forward looking, backward looking, inward looking, sideways looking. There's a lot of applications where it's being used.","What we're seeing now is that a lot of the early designs are now transitioning to the second generation of product, which is the MPSoC, it's the 16 nanometer product offering. What we expect to happen and obviously there's a lot of press on this, but these are still really very, very early days, and when you sort of hear about vehicles driving around, they don't really have the level five or anything close to that available. And the expectation is that over the next several years, that will roll out, and we expect this to be a combination of potentially a very powerful central CPU or CPU cluster, and then a whole host of other inputs.","We are targeting that using our 7 nanometer as the ultimate solution for this market, with more of a focus on the other elements as opposed to the supercomputer at the center of it all. And our expectation is that the market will evolve in a way that because things are unknown, it will take probably until 2030 before it's clear how it's evolving, and we expect to be a significant player addressing that and building on our ADAS leverage. And so, if you sort of look at the ADAS and if you look at our 16 nanometer solution, we already have tremendous investment in things like security, which are essential to this, where we're way ahead everyone else in terms of providing the best security for these solutions.","And I think you're probably aware that this is one of the biggest concern in this market going forward, because if the cars can be hijacked, that's not a particularly comforting thought, right? And so, we're in the midst of it all, we're continuing to invest the current business that's driven by 28 nanometer, it's now moving. And over the next five years, there will be significant deployment, and we already know the models, in 16 nanometer, the MPSoC solutions where we have a larger role, and then we're working on the 7 nanometer, which will enable us to continue to stay in the game going forward. So, hopefully, that answered your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","John Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, Moshe, my question for you is on competition. I was wondering if I could get your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about competition these days. Obviously, since your main competitor has been acquired, it's been no secret that they've really had struggled to execute. You guys have clearly have dominated the last three nodes and even moving forward, it doesn't look like you're going to get a lot of pushback. And I'm wondering, given your success that you're getting in Zynq and embedded SoC, are you starting to see your competition becoming more the ASICs and ASSP players, or are you still see your competition is traditional FPGA? And if your competition is starting to shift a little bit, are there any sort of changes that you need to make to address that?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. Well, that's a great question. And indeed, you're right. And actually this is an ongoing transition which is happening. And as our devices are becoming more and more sophisticated, they're all in the systems exchanging. And whereas in the past, the programmable logic for the FPGAs used to have a relatively well-defined role, but it was more of a auxiliary capability. Now, these All Programmable have very sophisticated SoCs with highly integrated programmable logic of moving to the center of the customer's system. And now, because we're using this technology and it's happening in conjunction with the transition to heterogeneous computing, right, which is people moving beyond the traditional computing models to others where there's a need for parallelism, we have a very good match with a lot of these new applications. And in particular, if you look at machine learning and artificial intelligence, that sort of the killer application which transcends all of these and actually can be very well addressed by our solution.","As a result of that, we definitely are seeing very different competition. I would say that the market is about 60% in terms of revenue is in our more traditional historic competition, but there are \u2013 actually there's less players in that market, and I'm not only talking about Altera, which is now part of Intel, but you're seeing less and less competition in those markets like A&D, Broadcast and the like. They really are seeing less competition because that's very fragmented, and test and measurement is another example of those.","And then about 40% what we're seeing, and this is very market specific, we're seeing different competitors. So, if you look at wired, the biggest competitor would be Broadcom and in some case high-end ASICs. And if you look at wireless, it's more ASICs than anything else, and a solution for that is the high level of integration with our RFSoC.","You look at things like Automotive and Data Center, then what you see is the big semiconductor companies there, and they are addressing it through their SoC-based solutions. And the way we're attacking it is not frontally, it's based on our strengths because we believe that the ability to use the programmable logic as the differentiator is a key element, which is very difficult to duplicate any other way.","And so, we're addressing those markets there. But it is a very different and competitive map and it was \u2013 it's also one which requires us to invest a lot in ease of use, and that's the biggest knock on our technology in the past whereas it would only work with hardware designers, and a lot of these companies don't even have hardware designers or have very small teams, and that's why the SDAccel and SDSoC products were so important, and those are the things that Lorenzo highlighted.","The Amazon deployment of this technology not only will benefit our business with the hyper-scalers but actually will enable us to compete on a broader base in all of these markets against other SoC providers.","Next question, please?","Operator","I'm sorry. Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Moshe, congrats on the good quarter and outlook, in particular. On the quarter you just posted, the Broadcast, Consumer and Auto end market did very well. I wonder if you can maybe dig into the components there. You gave us a little bit about Auto, but can you talk about the other two sub-segment or sub-end markets there?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. Both the other two elements of those end markets actually did a little bit better than expected. They're still relatively and, as everybody knows, consumer isn't a focus area of ours, but we're seeing some interesting opportunities develop in certain end market niches there that we're particularly suited for. And so we'll see how that evolves over time. The ABB strength is really I think a cycle, product cycle, where, again, our products are particularly well suited for the evolution of that industry, and so we've seen success there. And we probably will continue our strength there. As Moshe said, we're seeing less intense competition from a traditional sense there.","And we'll point out, auto was coming off of pretty spectacular record quarter for us last quarter. So, where it is today, we see it continuing to strengthen through the rest of the year. So, again, based on the designs that we have on our 28-nanometer Zynq product line, in particular.","Does that get to your question, Will? Okay.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Next question, please?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Ji (33:23) on for Ross. Thanks for letting me ask a question. The growth expected in the Industrial, Aerospace & Defense segment in the September quarter is actually a little bit better than our prior expectations for a flat to slight decline. Can you discuss some of the sub-segments within that IAD segment in the September quarter? And does this imply that fiscal year 2018 growth can be above the prior guidance for 5% to 9% growth year-on-year?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So let me take the bigger question first, which is, as we go through quarter-to-quarter and as each of our end markets trends through the year, there'll be pluses and minuses throughout the year. So I wouldn't read next quarter's guide as anything on the full year yet. I mean, ideally, all the positives continue, but that's just not the reality. Within the \u2013 each of the end markets for Q2 in the Industrial and A&D space, we actually expect each of them to be growing different degrees. So we see strength across the board.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much. Moshe, I just wanted to clarify something, and I'm not expecting your AI-related business to grow overnight, but I just wanted to revisit something you said a few quarters ago and are we still on track for that. You had said that by \u2013 exiting fiscal 2018, it could be tens of millions of dollars. And so question, are we on track? And would you need to get additional wins beside the AWS? And also, if you could please highlight any details you could give us on the Baidu announcement that came out a few weeks ago. Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","So, no, there's seven hyper-scalers, and then there's also two significant systems companies that are very close customers and partners. You can look at our release and you can sort of figure out the people who are in CCIX. CCIX is the protocol which addresses and is targeted at \u2013 particularly, this market addresses this area.","So, as you look at those, the tens of millions of dollars do not require massive adoption by additional players. It's sort of \u2013 it's based on what we believe and, for better or for worse, this is the way it's panning out, but this is based on the existing business we have with numerous players, which is going to be relatively small, the business with AWS, which I think will carry the bulk of this. And then any of the other players, and we're working with all of the other six hyper-scalers and these two system-level companies who are pursuing these businesses, which is to be cloud-based providers, they're likely to contribute, but not significantly this year, right?","And that's \u2013 and as they come on and as the AWS potential deployment increases significantly, then that's what sort of enables us to grow beyond these numbers. But there's nothing in those tens of millions of dollars which sort of assumes huge design wins translating to revenue other than the ones that you're sort of aware of. And the Baidu one generally belongs in that other category. We're not counting on it yet for this \u2013 for our fiscal year 2018 numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. And actually, if I could just follow up on what you just said, Moshe, on the Data Center. One, curious if you could just level-set us as to just how big that segment is in the June quarter. And then to your comments about the projects that you have, I'm just kind of curious if you can delineate between FPGA-as-a-Service with \u2013 so similar offerings to Amazon versus more direct deployments for internal use such as what Microsoft is doing.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","So those numbers are primarily driven by the Amazon, which is FPGA-as-a-Service. Now, FPGA-as-a-Service is a lot more difficult to do than an internal deployment, which has a very limited usage model. And I'm not implying that that's easy either, but that's a contained challenge.","Our expectation is that the \u2013 when the benefits of FPGA-as-a-Service, which is an incredibly aggressive move by Amazon, when those start to manifest themselves, they could, in of themselves, lead some of these other players once they see the benefits of that to integrate All Programmable devices into their solutions. And whether they do it as a service or whether they do it to enable their existing business, both would benefit from that.","But you're right, in the interim, it's the \u2013 FPGA-as-a-Service is the major driver short term. Now, we are working with all of these players on numerous options. And as you have numerous times pointed out, there's four categories of ways to skin the cat. And we believe that our way and the benefits of it are going to be clearer and more obvious over time. And we do expect to see the potential of that to being adopted in some of these other players for their core capability as opposed to just as a service solution. Hopefully, that answered your question, Blayne?","Operator","Okay. We have a follow-up question from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Dr. Srivastava.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you for the extra effort, operator, for pronouncing my name correctly. I had a quick follow-up for Lorenzo. On the turns, seems like on a \u2013 if we just look on a yearly basis, we've gone from 50% to 42%, is there a structural change in the business? We \u2013 I say, \"we grew up thinking PLDs, FPGAs were very high turns business, low visibility.\" Is this a structural change or reflective of the current condition we are in, i.e., visibility has extended maybe artificially because of some tightness in the supply chain?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So there's a couple of different things driving this. And I do think if you look back and just over the past year, you'll see a fairly big range in terms of the turns we've seen each quarter. A couple of things that \u2013 we are trying to get more orders in the book and make our quarters more predictable. Sometimes it just doesn't happen and customers don't make decisions based on our quarters. So, for the previous two quarters, we had a relatively high book; in the two quarters prior to that in FY 2017, we had a relatively low book. And in each of those cases, we managed to come pretty close to our guidance because we go through a couple layers of effort to understand what else is out there, what's likely to turn, where are consumers at in their decision process.","So we've seen a range of turns. I think we evaluate that internally. We are trying to get the bookings earlier in the quarter. It helps us with our predictability and it helps actually with our accounts receivable at the end of the quarter. But we can't always get what we want in working with our customers, but we do the rigor in understanding where the business is \u2013 where we think the business is going to come from in any given quarter.","So, I wouldn't say there's a structural change. I think we are working at obviously the whole optimization of our supply chain through time, but there will still be volatility.","Operator","Next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. You mentioned that you're going to be working with AWS over the next six months to optimize ease of use and performance. Is this ramp purely contingent on the customer ramp timeline at this point, or is there any update to your software, anything implementation related on your side that needs to be finalized first?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, it's a joint effort. The technology we have provided that to Amazon and being packaged by Amazon in a way where they have their own deliverables. We continue to \u2013 to the extent they need more help from us, we're very motivated to help them and it is our top priority for that.","I would say that, in terms of anything profound from us, we've already delivered all of that. The big invention has been done, and now it's being handed over and needs to be productized in a way where Amazon feel comfortable with deploying it broadly. And of course, we'll provide what they need, but we don't know of anything which is a fundamental problem at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.","Mark Lipacis - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of related questions, I hope you don't mind. On AWS, and the first part is a clarification, to what extent is this based \u2013 the interface going to be solely SDAccel versus like a Vivado interface? That's the first one.","The second one is, can you talk about what you view as the competitive environment with SDAccel? Are you picking up that your competitor has anything like this?","And the third one, Moshe, I believe last earnings call, you mentioned that you were not quite \u2013 it was a bit of a surprise, correct me if I'm wrong, but it was a bit of a surprise that you learned kind of late that AWS was working on this. And I was wondering if you had a sense, if any, of the other super seven guys are kind of engaged on this FPGA-as-a-Service also? Thank you very much.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. So, three questions is normally one more than I can remember. So if I might ask you to step in. But the initial deployment, they started the deployment at the beginning of the year, and that was an internal deployment which was just accessible to their hardware design team. The GA, which was on April 19, was a Vivado-oriented deployment. And that again is targeted at customers who have traditional hardware design \u2013 designers. And the new one, which we expect to be rolled out over the next month or so, is the one which has SDAccel. So, you are right, the first one was Vivado. And now, the new one will be SDAccel, targeting software developers.","With regard to the nine players who are targeting these markets, most of them are not looking at FPGA-as-a-Service and they're actually looking more at providing acceleration capabilities as part of their cloud-based footprint, but to enable their business as opposed to making a business of it. But having said that, there are quite a few who are looking at making a business of it, and I'm not at liberty of saying who is and who isn't. But obviously, Amazon is a tremendous homing beacon for quite a few of these. And some of them have announced capabilities but no one is anywhere close to where Amazon is in terms of the level of deployment.","And then the middle question...","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Does the competitor have anything like SDAccel?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Does the competitor have anything like SDAccel? I'm sure they're convinced they do. But truth is that this is technology which, at the core, is some unique proprietary synthesis technology, which we believe we're the only people in the world that have that. So we believe that this sort of approach is maybe not limited to us, but we have, by far, the best, the highest likelihood of being successful there.","That doesn't, to be totally honest, doesn't eliminate them as a competitor because they can try to address it in other ways, which are maybe more limited and maybe don't give the same benefits, but they can sort of try to do that. And I'm sure that that, to the extent that they're interested in pursuing it, that's the most likely way that they will, in which case we will have likely a very strong competitive advantage on that, too. And so that's the third of the three.","Next question, please?","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International","Yes, thanks for letting me ask a question, guys. I just wanted to make sure I understood the math to getting the 30% operating margin by the end of the fiscal year. So, for the current quarter, OpEx is, per guidance, $253 million, which is a little higher than what we are forecasting, but you're also forecasting gross margins to be better, too, I think, at 70%. So, I guess, should we assume that you hold OpEx here at that current level, in the $250-million-plus range? And I guess on slightly higher quarterly revenue, that's how you get to 30%, or is there other dynamics? Thanks a lot.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So what I tried to describe at our Analyst Day, Romit, was some of the general trends over the year that we were expecting. And on OpEx, we do expect to step, as we've said, this quarter, and then a little step next quarter from tape-out expenses and then have a leveling off or a decline. And concurrent with that, as you have anticipated, our revenue growth throughout the year, that would give us the result that we've been talking about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.","Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, guys. Just taking a step back, I'm looking at the deep learning and AI on the Data Center side. If you look at the Comm & Data Center segment, are you still sticking with the 1% to 4% year-on-year growth given the trends in the wireless and the Data Center side for fiscal 2018, that is? Thanks.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. We don't see a reason to change those ranges. For all of the three components we provided two months ago, we believe that they'll end up in those ranges. Now, they probably won't all end up in the middle of the range, some will be higher, some will be lower. But we don't see a reason to modify the range at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.","Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hey, guys, congrats on a solid quarter. For Aerospace, it seems like that's being helped by strong passenger growth year-on-year right now. Do you see kind of a reacceleration in that business? And similarly, for Defense, there are \u2013 some believe there are kind of multiple new global defense cycles beginning. Do you agree with that or do you just kind of see this as steady as she goes?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, we \u2013 I would say, we are less dependent on passenger patterns primarily because \u2013 well, there's a few reasons. But, A, it's much broader than planes. We play in a lot of areas. And even when it gets to planes, they don't immediately change the number of planes they are building. That takes years to sort of put the infrastructure in place.","So, what we are seeing is the latter element that you talked about, which is seeing across the board, not only in North America, but first of all, there's a bigger investment in Aerospace & Defense. And it appears to be just going in that direction. And the budgets are growing and as you know, there's sort of pressure from the U.S. administration on the Europeans to pay a larger portion of the NATO bills, and one of the ways of doing that is by buying more equipment. And I think we're seeing that across the board. And it's difficult for us to predict which way it's going to go, but it doesn't appear to be going away by any stretch.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James.","Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Just a question on gross margins, which in the guidance is a bit higher than what you indicated in the Analyst Day, what you've shown in the past couple of quarters. Is that mix related? If you could provide some explanation of that and what we should expect going forward. Is what you talked about at the Analyst Day still the right way to think about gross margins going forward?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. Again, I'll start with the end and then come back to this current quarter. We're still comfortable with the range that we provided for the year, which is 68% to 70%, we're not changing that as of now.","For Q2, what you'll see, what we've talked about already, is relative weakness in wireless and relative strength in the Industrial and A&D segment for us, at which that mix shift tends to help our gross margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks, guys. As I'm near the end, hopefully I can trade in one question for two quick clarifications. Lorenzo, I think you said that R&D or OpEx will be trending down towards the end of the fiscal year, is that true? And should be assume then that OpEx will be down on a year-over-year basis in fiscal 2019? And then, are there any more discrete tax items coming for the rest of the year that you anticipate?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So, again, I'll kind of start in a different direction. We're not going to give FY 2019 guidance yet. And to clarify on what we said on OpEx for the year, we're showing a step-up this current quarter, primarily driven by R&D. We'll likely see a step-up in the next two quarters. Tape-outs will be a big driver of that, but we're also continuing to invest in supporting the business. And then we will see \u2013 we're likely to see a decline in the fourth quarter as \u2013 again, driven by tape-out expenses not happening. We get through of bulge of them by the third quarter. And like I said, we'll talk about FY 2019 sometime later.","With respect to discrete items, one of the drivers that I pointed out in my remarks was how we are accounting for excess stock-based compensation. And that's driven by a difference in stock price, current stock price versus historic stock price, really. So we'll see some of that going forward. We haven't sized that yet and we can't size that yet until we actually go through the quarter and see what the stock price does.","Operator","Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie Research.","Srini Pajjuri - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Hi, Moshe, how are you? Just a question, a clarification on the wireless segment, you said it's a little bit weaker in the short term. Could you give us a bit more color by, I guess, China and India, what you're seeing out there? And then you mentioned that 5G won't happen for a couple of years. And as we bounce around these levels for the next couple of years, what's the risk that you could see some ASIC conversions in the existing 4G business, given the maturity of that business?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","So, let me start with the ASIC conversions. To the extent that they are viable, they already have been done on 4G, right? That's sort of been in production for several years. And I would say you never take your eye off that, but I think most of the important ones with the people with that capacity probably have already happened. So I don't think there's a huge risk on 4G there.","What I do think is going to happen is there's \u2013 this past quarter, the June quarter, there was a surge, a very significant surge on the wireless business. And the current quarter, the September quarter, we expect it to go down quite a bit. And I expect this sort of volatility to continue over the next few years until 2020, but I don't think that the average business is likely to go away because there are ongoing deployments and there is densification and a whole host of other things which we tend to see, and there's more global deployment still ahead of us there.","So, on average, we expect it to remain this way. And, yes, indeed, India, which was growing very well, is taking a hiatus and China is currently not in a huge surge in terms of deployment, but we do think that some of these areas will start the pre-5G deployments, and that should help fill things in in addition to additional deployment of the older protocols.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Operator, I think we could...","Operator","Your next...","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","We'll take \u2013 this will be the last question, Sarah, if that's okay?","Operator","Okay. Yes, sir. Thank you. Your next question comes from Ruben Roy with MKM Partners.","Ruben Roy - MKM Partners LLC","Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question at the end here. Moshe, you mentioned something when talking about AWS, it was interesting to me, you were saying that you're working arm in arm or shoulder to shoulder, I guess, with the engineers there. And as you spend more time on that specific program, are you \u2013 I'm wondering if the resources that Xilinx will need to support that type of customer and that type of program are different from traditional FPGA programs and applications. Have you gotten any sense that that might happen?","And then longer term, as the service is actually being used outside of AWS by end users, does that change kind of your sales process where resource is required to support? I think that's it. Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes. So, generally speaking, I 100% agree with your observation. The challenge is how to do it and how to scale it. And one of the benefits we have is the model which can scale to thousands of customers very effectively. And so what we're doing is \u2013 this is being done through a combination of elements.","If for every new deployment we'd need to add additional resource, it would not be particularly attractive. Clearly, the level of investment on the Amazon side is a huge one, but that is a singular point. It's about as complex as it can get. And that's why we're so excited because we figure out, if we can make them successful, then this technology and the SDAccel, and there's a whole host of other things that have been in put in place, are going to be applicable to the breadth of our customers and should enable us to support the business and continue to leverage the resources we have.","And so the answer is it's a combination of things, it's a transition we've been going through for several years. The Amazon is the ultimate in terms of what they are trying to achieve. It's a very different support infrastructure, it's one which is built through collaborative interaction on the Web, and we're figuring out how to support that. But once we have that in place, it should scale for our other customers, and I don't think \u2013 the best we can tell, it doesn't change our business model. But we need to constantly make sure that we address this to facilitate that more efficient support infrastructure.","Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for joining us today.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon A. Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $510 million in the December quarter, down 6% sequentially. Weaker-than-anticipated sales were primarily due to the communications and broadcast end markets. In addition, consumer automotive sales were also slightly weaker than we had anticipated. Sales from North America were up sequentially driven by defense, while sales from all other geographies decreased. Turns were 57% for the quarter.","Gross margin was a record at 66.6%. The improvement in gross margin was driven by favorable customer mix, as well as continued focus on margin expansion projects across our product portfolio. Operating expenses of $218 million including amortization, were lower than expected due primarily to the gain on the sale of a building, as well as lower-than-planned litigation expenses.","New product sales were up 17% sequentially, with particularly strong growth from Kintex-7 and Virtex-6 FPGAs. Both 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer sales increased sequentially.","Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communications and data center decreased 11% sequentially, including declines from both wired and wireless communications. Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased 7% sequentially, with a double-digit increase in defense, offsetting flat industrial and declining test and measurement sales. All 3 subcategories in broadcast, consumer and automotive declined sequentially.","Net income for the quarter was $104 million and included a tax benefit of $6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share related to the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain previously unrecognized tax positions. Earnings per share was $0.38 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $5 million, lower than planned due primarily to a one-time royalty payment.","Operating cash flow for our December quarter was $123 million before $8 million in CapEx. We paid $57 million in cash dividends during the quarter and repurchased $20 million of stock. The tax rate during the quarter was 10%, lower than guided due to the $6 million reversal I mentioned earlier. Diluted shares for the quarter were 271 million shares. There was a 6.2 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at approximately $3.2 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.9 billion. Days sales outstanding increased 4 days in the December quarter to 41 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased by $22 million sequentially, more than expected due to the lower sales than anticipated, as well as a planned increase in safety stock across newer technologies, in anticipation of future revenue growth.","Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 131 days, up from 109 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory dollars to be down in the March quarter and will continue to work towards our target of a 90 to 100 days of combined inventory.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter for fiscal '13. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We expect strong growth from our 28-nanometer products. From an end market perspective, we expect communications to increase slightly. We expect industrial, aerospace and defense to be up sequentially, with growth from all 3 secondary end markets. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 2% to up 6% sequentially, with sales from all geographies up slightly. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 58%.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66%. Operating expenses in the March quarter are expected to be approximately $208 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. R&D is expected to be between $108 million and $112 million, declining significantly due to a lower level of tape-out expense. SG&A is anticipated to be between $94 million and $96 million, increasing due to higher litigation spending, as well as the absence of the asset sale mentioned earlier. This will result in fiscal year operating expenses of approximately $855 million, slightly less than the $860 million in fiscal year 2013 guidance we provided last quarter.","Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 274 million shares. The tax rate for fiscal Q4 is expected to be between 13% and 14%. As a result of the recent reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, in fiscal 4, there will be a catch-up benefit to the tax provision of approximately $11 million covering previous quarters.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While there has been some weakness in the economic environment, I am pleased with the 70% sequential growth from our new products. This growth was driven by robust sales of our Virtex 6 40-nanometer product family, as well as a nearly 20% sequential increase 28-nanometer sales, which significantly exceeded our $20 million forecast.","28-nanometer sales were driven by our midrange Kintex-7 product family, offering unparalleled price performance per watt and a high-performance Virtex-7 family. As we begin 2013, I have grown ever more confident in our 7 series portfolio. We now have all 4 key elements of this optimized scalable portfolio in the market, all programmable FPGAs, SoCs, 3D ICs and the Vivado next-generation design environment that enable these next-generation devices.","A broader portfolio is enabling us to increase penetration in many of the highest-growth electronics, applications and also combinations of these devices into ever smarter, bandwidth-hungry, 100-gig wired networks, wireless HetNets, data centers and vision-based systems. This broader portfolio has also enabled us to displace a large number of ASICs and ASSPs.","Vivado is the industry's first SoC-strength design environment delivering unmatched time to integration. It reduces months of design activity to weeks, makes our next-generation devices possible. The current adoption of Vivado is now estimated to be already at roughly 35% of all of the 7 series designs.","We continue to be very pleased with the 7 series rollout, which was without any question the most aggressive and complete new product introduction in our history. We expect healthy sales momentum to continue in the March quarter, with sales comfortably exceeding $30 million.","While Xilinx has not been immune to the weakness in the economic environment, the innovation, differentiation and value advantages of our 28-nanometer product strategy has enabled us to clearly move a generation ahead and is driving accelerated share gains against both ASIC, ASSPs and traditional PLD composition.","We look forward to providing you an update at our Analyst Meeting on March 5 in New York City. Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Meer Kalucha calling in for Chris Danely. So I have a question on the communication side of things. Given your experience on pushouts in the December quarter, how are you thinking about the March quarter? Do you think there's a possibility of something similar happening? Or are you confident that whatever happened is behind us?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, let me take that one. So the world is still pretty choppy out there for us, but we are certainly seeing signs of improvement. So for example, we're starting to see the beginning of what people have called the sixth phase in China of the TD-SCDMA, so 3G additional base station deployment, and we believe we were starting to ship some units, certainly not the full level at this point in time, but some units into that particular ramp. So that gives us a positive view of the world. Also I think most of what -- much of what we saw in this quarter was a combination of some sluggishness by large communications customers in terms of their end demand and also some inventory correction. And I would anticipate the inventory correction aspect of that to be -- have worked through -- throughout this past quarter, the December quarter, and therefore will be moving back more towards I'd say traditional end market sales in that area. So those 2 things together make me feel relatively confident that comps should be moving up. And we're kind of behind -- the worst of it is behind us. But anytime someone tries to call the bottom, they're usually wrong. So I'll give myself a little bit of an out there.","Sameer Kalucha - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And then just a little color on how you're thinking on the 28-nanometer ramp this calendar year going forward?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, we set targets of $10 million and $20 million in past quarters and exceeded them. We set a target of $20 million this quarter and significantly exceeded that. The target is $30 million, and we expect to significantly exceed that in this -- in the quarter we're in. So we're seeing that come out of the chute and accelerate and come plan and it's working well. So I continue personally to be extremely optimistic and enthused about the rollout of the 28-nanometer.","Jon A. Olson","And we came out with our midrange product, which was targeted at the wireless communications area, and we just pointed out in the call how strong that Kintex business was inside of the 28-nanometer revenue. So we think we are on the path to achieving the kinds of growth in segment and share gains in the wireless segment with Kintex in particular. So that's been a strength for us and we have elements of all of our portfolio in production at this point in time. So things are moving quite well relative to the characterization and production worthiness of our portfolio. So pretty happy with it at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Outside of comm, can you please talk about the visibility in the other end markets? And then my quick follow-up, Moshe, on the 28-nanometer, can you help us understand whatever guidepost you can provide us to give us confidence that in 28, the non-comm segments will be bigger, i.e. in consumer and automotive that you have been talking about?","Jon A. Olson","So from an outside comms perspective, I think we've gone through an inventory cycle or mini correction, if you will, in the industrial side of things. And across the board, all of our geographies are stronger in distribution backlog going into this next quarter and a lot of the industrial segment. They don't just serve industrial, but a lot of it is served there, and I believe there's -- the backlog is demonstrating some strength in the, I'll say, the non-aerospace and defense portion of our industrial. So I think -- we believe that both aerospace and defense and industrial, that category is our broad industrial name is one of our -- I think it will be one of our fastest growing, percentage-wise, segments that we have throughout this year. So I think there is -- the inventory issues have been worked through. We talked also about aerospace and defense growing in March, which is actually very -- it is not very typical for us, so again kind of not the seasonal patterns of aerospace and defense, but we have continued strong business there. So I think outside of comms, we have laid the seeds for accelerated growth across the board, and that's really attributable to our 45-nanometer Spartan class product, as well as 28-nanometer.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","And with regards to 28 non-comms rollout, it really is an unparalleled generation of product in terms of its breadth and depth. And as such, it serves lots of markets, not only communications, as Jon pointed out, wireless communications is ideally serviced by the Kintex product line. But if you look at the broad product portfolio, it addresses all of the markets. And if you look -- I think, where we have a minimum of 1 year lead over our competition in terms of delivering samples to the products that really is a product that is targeted at automotive, industrial control, and of course, it also has communications applications, but it has tremendous breadth there. If you look at the high end of the product offering, where we don't have any competition, there's a broad acceptance that everyone who needs a high-end product, right, and that includes ASIC prototyping, but it isn't limited to ASIC prototyping, and for example, we're seeing a lot of military applications that are utilizing the unparalleled capacity we provide to customers there. So now this is not only a comm story, 28-nanometer is the broadest, the deepest portfolio and addresses all of the markets that we're in, including all of the ones that you mentioned. And some of them take a little longer to turn to revenue, some of them happen faster. But so far, the non-comms world is working well on 28 in terms of design wins and transition to revenue, continue to be very confident in that.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Ryan Carver in for Jon Pitzer. So given comms is down sort of 11% and you guided it up slightly, if you look at sort of seasonality, I guess, first half is typically the stronger side of the comms business, with actually the March quarter being the strongest. So I mean, give us some of the pushouts and maybe the resolution of some of the fiscal cliff. I mean, how much do you think we may see an atypical growth pattern in comms this year, with potentially comms being stronger in the second half relative to historical?","Jon A. Olson","I think we did say comms is up slightly in this next quarter, which is the first quarter of the calendar year and our last quarter of the fiscal year. And what I wanted to be as transparent as possible here because I am a little -- I'm always concerned about how strong snapbacks are going to be and things like that. So we do think it's going to be up, we do think it's going to be stronger, it's because some of the things I've said earlier, particularly on wireless customers and overall inventory. But we are seeing the big CapEx spending that has been talked about relative to some of the newer technologies rolling out, particularly in the wireless segment. And we are -- we do believe that those, assuming all the rhetoric about that is true in terms of are they actually going to have that CapEx spend, that we'll have a growing contribution from those spends as we move throughout the year, and that, I would say, it's likely that the second half would be better than the first half.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I just had a quick question on the industrial defense in the December quarter, which appears to be -- I know defense was up kind of seasonal for you, but the flat industrial, traffic industrial, if you want to put it that way, appears even better to be than your peers. And then I just have a very quick follow-up on the tax rate for fiscal '14, if you could give us some sort of guidelines on where you think that's going?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So Brendan, in the industrial category, industrial and defense category for December, yes, we clearly had a really strong, I guess, you could call it seasonal contribution from that particular area, and the other end markets were a little -- were weaker and mixed. And I think one of the bigger -- the bottom of the industrial -- pure industrial part for us happened, I'd say, in the September quarter, and we just kind of was -- kind of bumped along again in the December quarter and largely all that inventory adjustment and -- had been worked out. And so we do think that, that's going to be stronger going into the next quarter. The defense spending was up not just in, I would say, in the defense side, but also the aerospace side, meaning the nonmilitary aspect of things for us in the December quarter. And we are shipping into some new programs in March that are kind of the first time shipments for a new family of products that we have for the aerospace and defense area. We're starting to ship those now in a reasonable big way over the next couple of quarters into one specific program. In addition to some of the other broad-based programs that are continuing into March. So while there's a lot talked about the whole sequestration and cut back and et cetera, and I think we've been impacted to some degree last year in that, we are seeing the selected programs that we've been successful in winning over the years to continue to move forward. So that feels pretty good for us. The tax rate for FY '14, so I specifically -- we have not done our full year forecast yet for the next year, so I really can't give you a specific number. But if you look at the -- what -- including the impact of the R&D -- reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we guided between 13% and 14%. I think for now, that's as good number to use for our FY '14  as I can give you guidance, but I reserve the right to reset that when we get to the Analyst Day in March.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Jon, so I think you've done a good job describing the advantages of your 28-nanometer families. But I think investors are still trying to reconcile the share commentary, both of you having about 65% to 70% share. It seems there's 3 explanations: number one, one of you is overestimating the share or both of you are missing an additional 1\/3 of the market, you're both underestimating 1\/3 of the market. Or perhaps the third explanation is that there's wins that you're counting that aren't going to yield the same historical number of production ramps and volumes. So which one do you think it is and why wouldn't it be number three?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. So that's a great question, Ian. Look, we are very confident in our portfolio. I think at this point, the revenue is starting to grow to demonstrate that. It's still early days. The reason that we believe we have a stronger position is we have a broader portfolio, and there are elements of it where there is no competition, there's elements of it where the competition -- we were way ahead in terms of availability of the product. That provides us with a significant advantage. In addition, in other areas where you could say there wasn't a significant time lead to other side, where the benefit we have there is typically significantly lower power and -- but it's a [indiscernible] performance and actually now a much better software design suite. Several of these advantages are new and they're a result of an intense investment we've made in R&D. And so they're yielding now these superior results, and the customers are seeing that and sharing that with us. So those are the reasons we believe we have a very, very strong position. And now in prime time, it's starting to manifest itself and we'll see how it rolls out over the next 2, 2.5 years. We're expecting great things in terms of design wins there. They need to translate into revenue. You're right in pointing out that there's not even a -- not a perfect correlation between design wins to revenue, but we're seeing some really good results. And time will tell, but we're very confident based on the breadth and depth of our product portfolio and its superiority. I don't know into which of the 3 categories that falls, but that's how we see it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This is Ryan Goodman in for Srini. Question on the comms business. Sounds like you're pretty positive on that for the year, both on the wireline and the wireless side, but I was curious more in the near term. You have LTE starting to pick up, but you've also talked recently about new IT budgets coming in, which will help on the wired side. Which one are you feeling a little more positive about in the coming quarter?","Jon A. Olson","Well, I think the wireless gains are easier for us to tie back to specific activities going on geographically in the wired aspects of things, usually are much more diverse around a set of carriers and corporate providers in corporate spending, which is much harder for us to correlate precise -- more precise trends, et cetera. So I would seem to have a little bit better visibility, a little bit better confidence on what's going on, on the wired side. But that being said, we have one data center, high-speed connectivity kinds of design wins in the data center area that by the middle of the year and the second -- the mid- to second half of the year will start to kick in. So I feel pretty -- and these are areas that we have not participated in, in a big way in the past and we are now. And so I feel pretty confident that those design wins, which are more tied to data processing -- or excuse me, data center type companies that are -- have significant market share in those areas, I feel confident that midyear to second half of the year, those are going to start showing up as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Securities International.","Sidney Ho - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","This is Sidney Ho for Romit. So in terms of your operating expenses, you guys have done a great job taking it down to like $208 million next quarter. I know you're probably going to talk about this in your Analyst Day, but generally, how should we think -- should we think of this as a new base for your OpEx and understanding that some of that is because of asset sale last quarter? And then a little longer term, your competitor has talked about 10% growth in OpEx this year. I know you don't talk about specific numbers now, but how do you guys think about revenue growth versus OpEx growth in the upcoming year?","Jon A. Olson","Well, if you look at our guidance for our fiscal Q4 and then the previous 3 quarters, you'll see up and down, up and down, and it really is because of the crescendo, if you will, or the peak of the 28-nanometer tape-outs. We haven't added, I would say, a significant number of heads in the company, and we've actually had more geographic dispersion of the adds that we have had to lower-cost geographies. So we really haven't increased payroll base significantly, some, but not significantly throughout the year. It's really been a mask and wafer spending perspective. So when you look into next year, we do have some things we have to finish on 28-nanometer technology, and then we'll be beginning to launch the next generation of products, but those obviously won't have a high number of tape-outs going on until more towards the back end of the year. So we'll probably, likely, have a slightly different profile to our spending next year. I wouldn't fixate on $208 million as being the new normal flatline because, again, it's up and down depending on the activities we have in the tape-outs. And you're right, I'm not going to give you a number right now, Sidney, you'll have to wait until a few weeks until we get to March, and I'll be a lot more specific about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Eliscu with UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to focus on the industrial segment some more. If I look at your guidance, it looks like you'll be, for the full fiscal year, you'll be down mid- to upper single-digits. Can you give us an idea of which of the subsegments within industrial have underperformed this past year and then if there's some type of snapback as we go into fiscal '14?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So the biggest underperforming subsegment has been defense. So we have -- we've pretty much felt that defense has been growing for us in the neighborhood of, on average, of about 10% per year, and this past year, it really hasn't grown much at all. It's been choppy and the growth rate has been fairly near 0. So that's probably been the biggest individual contributor to that particular segment. We aren't at our traditional peaks in, I'd say, the pure industrial area by a long shot or even in test and measurement. We're not -- our current run rate isn't near those peaks at all. So if those markets, as we believe they will, will start to come back next year, that should give us a significant benefit. And then hopefully the defense budget stuff gets worked out here in the next 60 days and people will know what to do and what not to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for the wireless segment as we move throughout the year, specifically on the geographic rollout. Is most of the wireless strength being driven by North America at this point? And what's your expectation for when China TD-LTE could start to kick in? And lastly, are you expecting anything material out of Europe, or other emerging markets, or India at this point?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So I think as we move throughout next year, we are expecting good North America spend environment, and we're also expecting China LTE to begin and start to ramp in the second half. Our best -- everyday, I guess I could probably give you a different version of the story and whatever, but our best views right now is it's the second half of the calendar year when that starts to ramp. I'd mention earlier that we're getting to start also -- getting the sixth phase of the TD capability going out to help round out some of the capacity issues, and that's going to be -- that's going to happen over the next 2 or 3 quarters. And then you're asking about -- specifically about Europe. I do believe that there'll be some activity in Europe. We've seen some signs of some things going on there. I don't think it's going to be a significant, a large contributor, it means -- but I think it's going to have some contribution. And I have no understanding of what's really going on in India, and I'm not willing to project when that might take off.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'd like to dig into the gross margin a bit, if I can. You delivered above target gross margin for the quarter, it's also above your long-term target and yet you're not blowing away revenue. So can you talk about the potential for that target to move? And what's the biggest driver, kind of over the next couple of quarters, that we should think about when we're contemplating on to model that?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So we have, really, over the last 3 years, really focused on margin improvement programs across the company and essentially leaving no generation of products unturned in terms of the things we can do to squeeze out some dollar -- positive dollars here and there, because we do have a pricing environment, and particularly as we go against nontraditional PLD competitors, it's a different environment for us and we have to make sure that we have the capability and the ability to stay in our business model while still competing vigorously against potential ASSP companies in other situations. So we have created a situation and a culture at the company over the last several years to really go after things, and that's both on the pricing side of being -- becoming much more mature and strategic about how we think about pricing, as well as some of the cost things we've talked about in the past. But that being said, if you just want to focus on this last particular quarter, we did have a drop in our communications by 11% or $30 million, and it was -- that drop was concentrated on a relative basis to a previous quarter in our large comms customers, which tend to have the volume pricing agreements that have -- put some level of pressure or they're below, in some cases, some of the designs are below our corporate average and corporate margin. So when you have less business sometimes, you can get an uplift in margin because of that customer mix. And we had both good cost profile and good contribution from improved cost across the last couple of technology generations so good improvement there. But we also had the losses in business that we probably -- which we would've had because we've had higher operating margin dollars if we were to have it. But that's really the reason why our gross margin popped up. We have been running at the top end of our model for some time now. There's not an artificial cap on gross margin, meaning because the model stays at 64 to 66 range, that doesn't mean we limit ourselves at 66, we'll take whatever -- we maximize whatever gross margin we possibly can get. We tend not to evaluate our model dynamically. We look at it once a year and decide whether we want to change it or not, and at this point in time, we're not changing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anil Doradla with William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Moshe, I think my question was around your strength on 3G versus 4G. So as we see North American deployments in 4G and some of the 3G, 4G in emerging countries, can you share with us how you look at your market share in each of these technologies or does it depend more on end customer? And I have a follow-up.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. Well, with -- if you look at our position in 28 vis-a-vis our position in 40, then in 28, Kintex was designed with a very close look at the needs of wireless. And we believe we have an overwhelming market share by definition, that has been used more for 4G than it has for 3G. And as a result, because it's a new rollout and Kintex-7 is a new product so my expectation is that as newer generations roll out, we have a better general position. And then of course, in some accounts, we have higher penetration, in other accounts, we have lower penetration. Generally speaking, we have a stronger hand, so if you look at the average position then it is better, but it is account specific. But the breadth at 4G in terms of the penetration is really very, very broad, and the faster that rolls out, the better off, I believe, our position will be. Having said that, we gladly welcome any fast 3G rollout too. We have a lot of design wins there. The other element to keep in mind is regardless of market share, which everyone spends too much time focusing on, the reality is that from generation to generation, the percentage of the bill of materials, which is implemented on the FPGA has typically gone up. Now it doesn't go up every single time, but as a generalization, it has gone up. And as a result, there should be a higher percentage of the bill of materials in 4G solution, which is implemented in there than there is in the 3G. So just generally speaking that FPGA SAM is growing from generation to generation. And our percentage there, we believe, with the 28-nanometer should grow too, in particular with Kintex, which is a home run with regards to wireless penetration.","Operator","Your next question comes from Glen Yeung with Citigroup.","Delos Elder","This is Delos Elder on behalf of Glen. I wanted to ask you about order linearity during the quarter, sorry, linearity during the quarter. And then with respect to some of the most recent order trends, how does that fare between distributors and direct sales, direct customers?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. Our linearity, I would say, was pretty -- I'd say, typical until we got to the very end. So October was pretty strong for us, and November was the middle month of the quarter as typically things slow down a little bit and it did, and we got into December and things were okay. And the last 2 weeks, it wasn't quite as good as we'd anticipated, which is why we missed our guidance slightly on the bottom end because of the last 2 weeks of the quarter. And that was really a combination of less-than-anticipated volume through distribution than we had anticipated and a little bit of rescheduling into the next quarter that we saw. So those are the primary drivers of what went on and essentially why we missed our orders slightly outside of our range. Relative to the profile of orders and backlog increase and how things have been going so far between distribution and direct, as I mentioned earlier, distribution backlog was stronger pretty much across-the-board for us and that was really good. And our direct backlog also was up from a quarter, beginning backlog from the previous quarter and then going into this quarter. So I wouldn't think -- I don't see any, really, difference between the 2, meaning they're both seem to be improving and not one versus the other.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Deepon Nag - Macquarie Research","This is Deepon for Shawn. If you could talk a little bit about the inventory pop. I know last quarter, you kind of talked about how it was mostly built over 28-nanometer products. Was it something similar? Just maybe the value in the mix of that inventory and what you plan on doing to get it down?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so the inventory did go up $22 million. Now some of that was a lower revenue profile, but we're also building safety stock increases in advanced technologies, inclusive of 7 series. Now Moshe talked about us having a target of $30 million for revenue for this quarter in the 28-nanometer technology or 7 series product families. And so we are building product in anticipation of that number are a greater amount of revenue so we have the right mix of products to be able to serve everything to our customers. But we're also increasing safety stock in a couple selected products, across a couple of older technologies, meaning 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer, also in anticipation of some very specific orders. And that caused their inventory to go up. Now we are a little bit out of mix and balance in terms of line item by line item. We were adjusting wafer starts, starting at the beginning of this past quarter, means the beginning of the December quarter. So those outs will start to fall, if you will, in the March and June quarters and will be bringing our inventory dollar level down, we believe, in both quarters, March and June, the dollar should fall.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ruben Roy with Mizuho Securities.","Ruben Roy - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Moshe, I just had a follow-up on some of the Kintex comments that you were making earlier. The first midrange product you mentioned that it was designed really with wireless infrastructure in mind. I'm wondering if some of the initial strength that you're seeing is coming from solely that market or if you're seeing strengths outside of communications for Kintex. And how is it lining up so far against your midrange competitive product out there, i.e. in comms specifically for instance, are you taking portions of the PCB that might have gone to your competitor? Or are you seeing some traction against other types of technologies?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. Well, Kintex indeed was targeted at wireless, and one of the unique features of the strategic decisions we made was that we recognized that wireless required a combination of pretty high performance, but focused on low power, and we think we aced that one and got the right combination there, and that has provided us with a very strong position there. And that's basically the strength together with very strong and actually industry-leading service, which again is -- has become a strength for us as we have invested very heavily in developing that capability. If you look at what is happening, then -- note, this is -- it's true that the product had, as its initial target wireless, but it has a broader reach than that. And we're seeing design wins on Kintex that address all markets that need higher level of performance and are cost sensitive and just don't require the ultimate performance for which Virtex is the right solution. So there's a lot that falls into that category, and actually we see that market expanding relatively rapidly. And if you look at the challenges, and to be honest, mistakes we made in the past, we did not have product that addressed that market and it went elsewhere. Now generally speaking, what we're seeing is, and I'm amazed that the data, because we predicted that this would happen and would start accelerating, and this is the ASIC and ASSP displacement, and that continues to grow and with each generation of product, there's like a quantum leap in the percentage of the bill of materials we can address because we can -- we have typically higher capacity, higher-performance and lower power. And except for high volume applications, the ability to justify ASSPs or for semiconductor companies -- sorry for customers to justify ASICs, for semiconductor companies to justify ASSPs, that gap continues to grow. And as we move -- have moved very rapidly into 28, we're benefiting from that, it requires having the right products. And one of the new elements we have is with our SoC device, Zynq product line, which is we've been delivering to customers for well over a year, that enables us to address new market, where we're displacing lots of medium and lower end ASSPs that -- and micro-controllers that our customers have been using. And as we come out with the higher end versions of the Zynq family, which are already available to customers, we can continue to move up in terms of product displacement. So there's largest share of the bill of materials, it's something we're seeing. And as we look at the detailed data, we're looking at ways to share that in March. We're just seeing that trend accelerate, and it's quite gratifying and that's one of the reasons that we are very bullish about the size of the market that is served at 28-nanometer by FPGAs and by Xilinx in particular.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Brian Peterson","This is Brian Peterson stepping in for Hans. Can you just talk about wafer availability and if that improved in the quarter, and if that impacted gross margins or maybe your decision to add a little bit of inventory, especially on the 40- or 65-nanometer processors?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. We generally don't have any, I'd say, significant issues on wafer availability. Now it doesn't mean there aren't -- there isn't some tightness at the foundries, but we've been able to navigate around that some. So it didn't really impact our gross margin as a result of any actions that we've taken or we are taking on the safety stock increase that's material or substantial. But quite frankly, we have built ahead in a few products that we are fairly confident we're going to get orders from just in case we -- I mean, just to make sure that we have the right mix in order to meet upside in the face of what I would say normal kind of tightness at the foundries, nothing extraordinary at this point in time. So to answer your question, it's kind of yes, we're building safety stock because there are some concerns that things could be getting tighter over time.","Operator","Your final question comes from Nick Clare with Robert Baird.","Nicholas A. Clare - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Nick calling in for Tristan Gerra. So I guess 2 quick ones. First, from a higher level, do you guys have any type of industry-wide kind of growth estimate for base station deployments for this year, or for your fiscal year, or calendar year, either way?","Jon A. Olson","No. I think you could get -- maybe Moshe has got something to say here, but I think we could talk to everyone of the predictors that studies this kind of stuff, and they all give us a slightly different view. So I'm not sure there's one that's right or one that we're subscribing to.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","We'll share our insights in March, right, to the best of our ability. But this is a prediction and we do obviously talk directly to our customers, and we have a central role in terms of fulfilling their requirements, so we'll try to translate that into something which you can hang your hat on. But generally speaking, when you break it down geography by geography, they ebb and flow not all at the same time and there is an expectation that some of the geographies that have been weak will actually have a significant deployment. And Jon did talk about China as being one of those. We'll try to give you better predictions, but we don't want to throw out a number at this point.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the September quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon A. Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $544 million in the September quarter, down 7% sequentially but within our guidance towards the lower end of our guidance. Weaker-than-anticipated sales from industrial and A&D, as well as computer and data processing, more than offset better-than-expected sales from wireless communications.","With the exception of Japan, which was flat, sales to all geographies were down sequentially. Turns were 57% for the quarter and relatively linear on a monthly basis. We continue to get the capacity we need from our foundry partners, and our lead times, with a few exceptions, are within normal ranges.","Gross margin was 65.5%. This level is a testament to our focus on margin improvement projects across our product portfolio, with particular emphasis on new product margins, which offset significant impact from customer and product mix during the quarter.","Operating expenses of $208 million were lower than expected as a result of the shift in tape-out activity, lower litigation expense and reduced discretionary spending. New product sales were up 7% sequentially, with strong growth from our 28-nanometer families while 40-nanometer sales were essentially flat.","During the quarter, revenue from our 28-nanometer products achieved our goal, surpassing $20 million. Mainstream products increased 3% during the quarter, with strength from the Virtex-5 products, driven primarily by LTE deployment activity. Base products declined over 20% sequentially, with most of the decreases coming from industrial, defense and communications.","Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communications in data center increased 3% sequentially, with strong wireless sales offsetting expected declines in wireline. Industrial and aerospace and defense sales declined 13% sequentially, with declines coming from all 3 subcategories: defense, industrial, scientific, medical and test measurement. Broadcast, consumer and automotive sales declined 15% sequentially, with sales from all categories flat to down sequentially.  The other category declined 24% sequentially, impacted by declines in computer and data processing, as well as storage.","Net income for the quarter was $123 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $10 million, higher than anticipated due primarily to an unfavorable hedging impact. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $197 million before $8 million in capital expenditures. We paid $57 million in cash dividends during the quarter and repurchased 2.5 million shares for $79 million.","The tax rate during the quarter declined due to a shift in our geographic mix of profits. Our new effective tax rate is 15%. In addition to the lower tax rate estimate for the year, in Q2, we had a favorable impact to tax expense of $4 million associated with the release of reserves related to a recent tax court case. The impact of these 2 factors represent a positive contribution to EPS of approximately $0.03 per share.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million. There was a 5.5 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $61 million to approximately $3.2 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.9 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased 3 days in the September quarter to 37 days.","Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased as expected by $11 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 109, up from 99 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory days to slightly increase in the December quarter.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year '13. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Additionally, we believe continued macroeconomic uncertainty may result in unpredictable customer ordering patterns. We expect continued growth in our new products but will most likely experience declines from our base and mainstream products.","From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be down sequentially. Within communications, wireless is expected to decline more than wired. Within industrial and aerospace and defense, we expect increases in both industrial occupations and defense. Automotive, consumer and broadcast is expected to be approximately flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 1% to down 5% sequentially, with sales from North America up, Japan flat, Asia Pacific and Europe down sequentially.","The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 59%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66%, up slightly from the September quarter, due primarily to improving customer mix. Operating expenses in the December quarter are expected to be approximately $224 million, including $3 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Almost all the growth from Q2 is related to an increase in map and wafer expense.","Q4 operating expense will decline substantially, resulting in combined R&D and SG&A expense of approximately $860 million for the fiscal year 2013, and it's at the low end of the range we provided at our analyst meeting last year. Given the uncertain business environment, we are slowing headcount growth and lowering discretionary spending.","Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 269 million shares, and the tax rate is expected to be approximately 15%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Macroeconomic environment continues to be a challenge for near-term semiconductor industry revenue growth, including Xilinx. This clearly affected sales for the September quarter and has also resulted in lower-than-seasonal guidance for the December quarter. With the uncertain near-term business environment that Jon mentioned, we're practically taking steps to slow headcount growth, reduce discretionary spending.","That said, we continue to be very confident about our mid- and long-term outlook, driven by continued design win momentum in our 28-nanometer offerings and new product revenue growth. In the September quarter, new product sales increased 7%, more than 80% year-over-year. Growth in new products was driven by the tremendous adoption of our 28-nanometer product families, allowing us to exceed $20 million to achieve our 28-nanometer revenue goal.","September sales growth was driven by significant growth in revenue from all members of our 28-nanometer product family in all of our key end markets. We have now clearly demonstrated to our customers that we're a generation ahead of our competition and offering those customers an extra generation of system value.","In our 28-nanometer FPGAs, we're delivering effectively the equivalent of an external performance, power and integration with an average of 100 -- of 1.5x advantage in every technical category. I think all programmable SoC delivers additional value by integrating multiple chips into one, including CPUs, DSPs and analog mixed signal components. Our 3D ICs are now integrating complex and have the smartest systems function such as packet processing, traffic management while adding 30s bandwidth in a single device that's unmatched by any competition.","With our Vivado Design Suite, we are both enabling our new generation of devices and delivering unmatched time to integration and implementation. Vivado is the first and the only ASIC and SoC strength design suite in the programmable industry. We've built Vivado from the ground up over a 4-year period, with an investment of over 1,000 engineering man years to enable the next decade of All-Programmable Devices that's creating a huge and sustainable advantage for both 28-nanometer and beyond.","I believe that with the breadth, value advantages and competitive differentiation of our 28-nanometer portfolio, we're undoubtedly a generation ahead of any competition. To clearly define our roadmap to stay a generation ahead, we plan to provide a high level 20-nanometer portfolio announcement in mid-November.","Being a generation ahead is accomplished through technology leadership with ever more advanced FPGAs, our second-generation SoCs and 3D ICs and even more significant leverage of our Vivado next-generation design suite. We continue to be pleased with the 28-nanometer rollout. We achieved our September revenue goal, reaching more than $20 million in overall sales. We're expecting to exceed this number in the December quarter as well and then expect very significant growth in the March quarter as more customers will be accelerating their production ramps.","Despite some uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, game-changing product strategy of the 28-nanometer node has put us in a tremendously positive competitive position and will drive continued share gains, both against ASICs and ASSPs and traditional PLD competition.","Now I'll turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.","Rick Muscha","Operator, I think we're ready for some questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","You mentioned that wireless this quarter would be down more than wired. I was hoping you could drill down into 4G specifically and talk about some of the activity you're seeing today in North America and China.","Jon A. Olson","Sure, Romit. This is Jon. So from a wireless perspective, the strength that we continue to have is around LTE deployments in North America or in the U.S., in Korea and as well as Japan. And while that -- those rollouts are continuing into the next quarter, we do think that there's, as there always typically is, there's some bumpiness along the way. But we still are shipping, I would say, the biggest portion of our Virtex family FPGAs that go in the wireless base station segment into the LTE piece. There are some additional GSM and TD-SCDMA activity going on for China, but it is -- the capital spend is actually relatively low. And as they prepare for -- in 2013 a bigger rollout, there are some systems going into that early part of that deployment. But relative to the lion's share of what we see, not only for this past quarter we just announced, as well as this next quarter, it is primarily LTE and it's primarily North America, Korea and South Korea and Japan.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Jon, you were saying that it's a little bumpy. Were you referring to China specifically?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, China is really much -- is really the bumpy part. The North America part seems to be still pretty steady as best as we can tell. And as you know, we ship to people who then ship to a variety of locations. We don't all know exactly where every unit is going in every base station, but based on our communications with our customers, that's really where the strength was. We noted that we had stronger-than-anticipated performance this quarter in wireless, and it's backing off just a little bit but it isn't -- it's still quite good and again, it's LTE-based.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, Moshe, you mentioned that your 28-nanometer revenue doubled in the quarter to about, I think, $20-plus million. Altera has been saying that the majority is tied to SSI and therefore, won't go into production. Could you give us a split how much is SSI?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, the revenue came from all 5 families, and the truth is 2 of the 5 families, there is no competition. One of them is SSI. And SSI goes into numerous applications. One is ASIC prototyping. And there, as long as it's the largest FPGA out there, then you keep getting additional wins in that category. So there is a scaling factor, it's not that it's a one-hit wonder in the first 3 months of the product line. It actually continues until there's a larger product line available from any other source. So it actually will continue, and we'll continue to see growth on that. In addition, there's a lot of design wins that go into the high end of the wired communications and the A&D applications, and those do go into production. So you can think of it as having this dual personality, both of which scale. And again, it's only part of the revenue, but even that part goes into some applications, which do go into production and others which just repeat themselves due to a whole host of other reasons.","Jon A. Olson","I mean, we stood at -- to add to that, we did ship to all those -- to the customers that are using them for all those reasons that Moshe talked about within this last quarter. So we did ship SSIT very broadly across the application set that it goes to. We tend not to want to parse out our $20 million about which product -- individual products and product families because it does get -- it's actually hard for us to keep all that tracking up because it's not that important to us necessarily to track one versus the other. But we did ship in a prototype and we also shipped into the comms and to A&D, wired comms and A&D, this quarter. And we're very attuned to the fact -- there's a lot of noise around the fact that SSIT only means prototyping, and that's really far from the truth, Romit.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Question on just on the end markets. There seems to be a little more noise and actually, you had a press release this morning on TD-LTE. What are you guys seeing? Are you seeing any early indications in that market or it's still too early to call? And then my follow-up is really trying to understand the non-communications part of the business, Moshe or Jon. And I'm looking at industrial and the other segments, and if you are taking share from the non-PLDs, shouldn't they be acting a little bit better than what we are seeing from the more generic analog kind of companies? And I'm talking about in terms of Q-over-Q decline.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. Well, there's actually quite a few questions there. So TD-LTE is -- it's still early days. It has -- as Jon indicated, the majority of the rollout has been in North America. There's still a tremendous amount of rollout that is required in North America, and there's some imbalance between the carriers in North America in terms of the level of penetration, one is well ahead of the others. The others need to catch up. Otherwise, they will have a tremendous competitive disadvantage, in particular as the smartphones become more and more prevalent and suck more and more bandwidth. So there's no doubt that there's a need for tremendous upgrades throughout North America, which will happen undoubtedly. The question is not if it will happen, it's only a question of when it will happen. It has to -- the consumer requirements are such that it's about the only solution that can handle that. So that's North America. Elsewhere, as Jon highlighted, it's been -- the rollouts have started in Japan and Korea, but there's room for significant upgrades there. And then the rest of the world, in particular, China and Europe, have not started anything equivalent to that, and so there's significant room for deployment there. So the consumer demands in the smartphones are making this a nondiscretionary decision. It's just book rate [ph]  and how quickly and when it will start in other areas of the world. So we're hearing that consistently from the companies we work with who are the equipment suppliers.","Jon A. Olson","Yes. And just one more comment on the first question, and I'll try to answer the second question for you, Ambrish. I tried to find out exactly if we could figure out how many base stations were being sold into China that were advanced technology because they keep saying, \"Well, they're doing some demos and prototypes, whatever.\" And as best as we can find out, there's a few thousand that are going to get built or deployed in this quarter, which is certainly not anywhere near what it would take for a rollout. And again, the best information we have is mid-2013 on the TD-LTE business. So it's yet to come, but we're not really experiencing it much there.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But Jon, there is a few thousand so that's good to know that this is not paper-based stations.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, yes, that's right. And again, as best -- as good as information as we can get about it, that's what I was able to get to try to figure out really when we might see a better ramp because of China CapEx spending. On your second question, there's kind of 2 ways to look at this. One is our industrial has been relatively weak the last couple of quarters. And in fact, even looking through this coming quarter in right now, the industrial business in Europe is starting off very weak, and the backlog is very weak and distribution information seems to be very weak in Europe in this particular category. So even though we are forecasting a little bit of growth, it's really kind of off of a, I would say, relatively low base. And I'd be surprised to see if anybody else has very bullish numbers on it, industrial. As other companies roll out, we'll obviously be watching that. And with your question around, shouldn't you see maybe a better uptake because of displacing ASSPs, the real winner for us in that area is going to be our Zynq product. And the design-in times, we've had a good uptake. It is still a new category, and we are developing it, and we're getting lots of successes and we're getting design wins. But quite frankly, we aren't on the acceleration knee of the revenue curve yet. And that's going to take a few more quarters before we get there. And that's really the part that's going to, I think, show up in a big way against ASSPs in the industrial category.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Actually, I had a clarification and then a question. On the clarification, Jon, if I heard you correctly, I think you said you're expecting 59% turns to hit the midpoint of the December quarter. How do I square that high turns requirement with the lower visibility? Is that a bit aggressive or I'm missing anything here?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So Vivek, that's -- obviously, we look at these numbers pretty hard, and when I saw the percentage number, I scratched my head a little bit and said, \"Yes, that seems like a high percentage number.\" But when you peel back the information, we're starting out with a lower backlog. We're aware of certain customers and certain of our end markets that normally would be booked now that aren't booked that we still have high confidence that they will come through. That's one point. The second point is if you look at the absolute dollar amount that it takes, again, remembering we have -- we're starting up with a lower backlog and we're trying to get to a lower revenue than this past quarter, the absolute dollar turns per week is at or slightly below what we've achieved the last couple of quarters. So it's a little bit of this percentage is the tyranny of creating a percentage out of both the numerator and denominator changing at the same time. From a dollar level, I think if we can sustain this current level of business that we have, we'll hit our numbers.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, very helpful. And then a question for Moshe. As I look at your 28-nanometer ramp, and I think your competitor has also disclosed some revenue numbers. It seems like if I ignore which particular application, it seems that you're both on a similar run rate, right, that they also expect a $20 million-plus this quarter and they did $17 million cumulative at the end of last quarter. And I think your numbers are probably in that $35-ish million to $40-ish million range. So is it fair to assume that your share is sort of 50-50 at this note? Or do you think that you can actually gain share, that there are certain design wins you have that you can actually start gaining share from this point onward, and if that's right, which are those areas that you think you are doing better than them in terms of design wins?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. So we have -- last quarter, we delivered over $10 million, which was higher than what the competition delivered. And it is definitely still early days, so these are the early returns from them. But as we look at the breadth of our product offering and we look at the technical advantages that we have, we have no doubt that we have huge advantage. It manifests itself. There are 2 areas where we don't have any competition yet, and it's likely to be long period of time until there is competition, which is anywhere close to catch up. So that's one major differentiator, and that's on the 3D ICs and on the same product line, which has the embedded ARM core. In addition, if you look at the core product offering, then typically, what we find is at the high end, we have much lower power footprint than the competition, and we're hearing this from our customers and from our competitor's customers too, right, who are surprised at how significant the advantage is there at the high end. The 30s are operating much better in a competitive situation, that has significant impact. In the mid-range, Kintex basically, because of the choices we made, we achieve a certain level of performance, which enables us to sweep the wireless business. And so we're very convinced that there'll be huge shift in terms of shipments into wireless customers. And that, we actually believe that their -- our original -- our preliminary data shows that we have even 80% market share in terms of wireless. And then -- and so between the -- at the core business, between the better service performance, lower power at the high end, higher performance in the mid-range, that gives us confidence that we'll have the lion's share even in the core market then when you add to that these additional markets with the 3D ICs and Zynq that gives us confidence and our target is 70% and we're hell-bent on achieving it.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And one last question, if I may. Just structurally as you look out to say the 20-nanometer node, and I believe you mentioned that you will have some product announcements soon. Just structurally, do you think that it will be a more profitable node than what you saw at 28, because I understand that a lot of the end markets are maturing a bit, but your cost and complexity of going to these more advanced nodes keeps on going up. So 40-nanometer node was profitable, 28 less so. How should we think about the transition to the 20-nanometer node? Do you think that there is a chance that the profitability will be any better than what you have seen in the prior transition?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So I strongly contest the profitability of 28-nanometer not being there. It has the potential of being the largest node for sure in the FPGA space by a significant margin. And we're seeing it come out of the shoot faster than everything we've seen before. It's just that the nature of the business is that it takes some point in time. But our -- the early data we have and the fact that we can displace ASICs and ASSPs quite affectively, not across-the-board but in lots of markets with our 28-nanometer product, gives us confidence that it's going to be a very large node. The extent of design wins is much, much higher than we've seen in every previous node. And we're hearing from customers that less and less of them can afford to design ASICs to compete with what 28-nanometer can provide. So I'm not sure I agree or I strongly disagree with 28-nanometer being less profitable than 40-nanometer. It will be a much larger node, it has the potential of being the largest node ever. On 20 nanometers, it is clear that due to the number of layers and the complexity of the layers, that the manufacturing costs are going to be higher. There's been a lot of discussion on that, and our way to address that is to make sure that we design the parts and we tape-out a number of parts which cover a broader market. So in terms of our investment at 20, it will likely be similar to what we invested at 28. And the markets we're going to address will probably be similar. It is getting more difficult at these advanced nodes as the designs are more complex and the mask costs are complex, and it requires us to invest a lot of time either in optimizing the design or making sure that we don't tape-out more parts than we need to. And we're up to that challenge, and that's the way we're approaching this node.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jon, I believe you talked last quarter about 2 of your major comms customers reducing inventory this quarter. Can you talk about whether they've, in fact, finished that inventory reduction? And how do you square that with the comms being a little bit better than you expected in the quarter? Is it that those decreases are just more than offset by increases of other customers and how should we think about that dynamic?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, the second part of your question -- because it was there hanging. It is -- that is true. What happened is that there was certainly an offset with other customers and some significant strength in another place, in the wireless segment in particular that helped to offset that. I think the answer to your first part of your question is, yes, I believe that both those customers are through that buildup, and we're back to a more normal level with them. And I think one of those 2 in particular ended up being pretty decent this quarter and really wasn't that much of a drop as it turned out. So I think we're on the other side. The reason I'm being -- I'm saying -- I'm cautioning that is, we don't always know what the order pattern is of some of our customers, and all of a sudden, they say, \"Oh, no, I need more, I need less\" at the last minute. But the current forecast would suggest that we are behind that, and that's behind us.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about what your customers in the defense and aerospace segment are talking about in terms of their behavior around fiscal cliff? Are they ordering more in advance of that? Or are they being more cautious and waiting and reducing their orders? How should we think about that effect on your business in the next 2 quarters?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So I've been studying this quite a bit because our A&D has not been growing at the rate that we, I would say, had typically would have expected it. We've had a pretty steady 10-plus percent growth year-on-year for quite a few years. And that growth rate has definitely slowed this year. And I'm trying to figure out, I'm trying to sort out how much of that is potential caution or individual programs. And our best information right now is that it's been more impacted by individual programs than people worrying about the cliff. Now I have a hard time correlating what our people are telling me relative to what I read from the defense contractors in the newspaper, but I can't tell how much of that is political posturing and what is real. But the best information we have is that people are not slowing down because of that. They're just kind of waiting it out, and we'll see what happens. And that most of why we aren't growing quite as strongly as maybe we have historically is just because of a couple of individual programs that are just in a space where they're not ordering right now and they'll order a little later.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe just a quick housekeeping question. You talked about the OpEx level reducing substantially into the March quarter. Is that kind of the right run rate as we -- expecting into the beginning of the next fiscal year or would you expect change either way?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, I'm not going to forecast next year, but I think since I pointed the way to the tape-outs and wafers and masks being the biggest driver up and then the biggest driver down, we don't have a large number of tape-outs early in the year because it's kind of the very end of 28 and the very beginning of 20. So I don't think you're going to see a big spike up or down from the Q4 exit, but I don't really want to pin a number on it.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Eliscu with UBS.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","We've heard a lot about SSIT and Virtex at 28-nanometer, yet Kintex was talked about as key element of your share gains at that node. Can you give us a sense of how much Kintex is currently driving your LTE revenue? And then within that revenues, within 28-nanometer currently, is Virtex or Kintex overall bigger? And then I have a follow-up.","Jon A. Olson","So Kintex has clearly been a early leader in design win level. Virtex has now caught up with it, relative to the dollar amount of design wins overall. But we led with Kintex part, it is specifically designed for wireless base stations, and as Moshe said, we've been winning a tremendous number of design wins. We did ship into production -- into the wireless space with Kintex in this quarter, so it is -- there are designs that are ramping, but it's been like early prototyping from our customers and early units. Prototype their early units not our prototype parts, but their initial base stations. I would say that the wireless segment in our 28-nanometer is probably about the same percentage as it normally is for the overall company during the quarter, which is in the neighborhood of 25-ish percent, and this is kind of just an estimate.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. I have a question on Zynq. Discussed about it earlier being potentially an important driver for your industrial business. To help us calibrate it, can you give us a sense as to when it will make up, let's just say, 5% of revenue? And besides industrial, what end markets are you seeing the biggest opportunities? And what have you learned given your leadership position? What have you learned that you'll be improving on your next generation?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So this is a Zynq question, right? You're talking about Zynq?","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Zynq.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so the lead end markets are automotive, industrial and communications. And within communications, it's heavily around wireless. In fact, the small cell category is a category that's a great opportunity for Kintex, and we have been doing pretty well there of late in terms of reducing the number of devices required by our customer -- in our customer's units because we have that processing capability, as well as the ability to do digital front end and other kinds of capabilities that are -- you find in a wireless base station, radio card in particular. So I would say early on, it was automotive followed by industrial and now communications is coming on very, very strong in this particular application. Industrial is very, very broad: automation, motor control, those kinds of activities. And then automobiles is usually our sweet spot, which is driver assist for this particular part. Those are kind of the highest level categories. And with respect to any forecast about when it might be 5%, I would guess that is several quarters away before that ramps to that size because the lead design wins are all, I would say, relatively a compilation of relatively medium-sized to small-sized design win dollar values initially, and then ramping very strongly, particularly when you think about automobile capabilities starting out at the high end and waterfalling down, which is exactly what our customer is going to use this capability for. It takes a while to get into those units in terms of get the unit build up enough because it has to go to different models of automobiles, et cetera. The wireless business is more -- will take off much more rapidly, but most of these deployments are most likely to come in the second half of '13.","Steven Eliscu - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Second half of calendar '13, correct?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. But I really haven't -- anyway -- again, 5%, I haven't studied it in great detail, but it's going to be a while before it's 5% of our revenue.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jon, one question for you backward-looking and then one forward-looking. In the September quarter, you mentioned how North America was the strongest area, especially in your comms business. But that geo was down the most, I think 11%. Can you just help reconcile what was going on between those 2 comments?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So as you recall last quarter, we had this end-of-life shipments, and a lot of that went into aerospace and defense and industrial category.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Automotive.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, automotive. And so if you look at geographically where the biggest impact, where that was is North America and Europe. So those were the 2, and North America in particular, the aerospace and defense portion is the lion's share of what we have in defense is in North America. So that was kind of a hard number to match and to make up from a comms number -- a comms perspective.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then the forward-looking question, a little bit following up on an earlier question on OpEx. I know you're not going to talk specifically for next year. But you mentioned that the tape-outs for 20-nanometer aren't really going to start in the first half of next fiscal year. Can you remind us, is the normal cadence of that more back half of the year or is there going to be almost a full year gap between the tape-outs you're doing now looking into next year?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So yes, I don't have a good sense for the rate of tape-outs into next year. We will do some tape-out activity in the first half of next year, but it just won't be the rapid fire progression because usually, the first 1 or 2 comes out a little more slowly as we get everything settled, and then as we're sure we got things right, then we accelerate those tape-outs. So I would expect the tape-outs will start accelerating in the back half of calendar '13 and then obviously throughout '14.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Starting on OpEx, the lower OpEx for September and then the higher for December, you talked about tape-out push as being part of that. Was there any kind of program that changed on your roadmap or was it just a timing thing, end of the quarter kind of push or can you describe that a little bit?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, it really was timing, Shawn. It was some things that were supposed to happen in the last couple of weeks of the quarter that pushed out to the first couple of weeks. So we're talking about a 2- to 3-week kind of push in the way -- just the way the accounting works for the mask payments. I guess you could say I believe the forecast, I don't know on that. But it did just push out a few weeks, and there were no significant program slips, changes or issues really as a result of that. But we had an additional payment to an outside supplier for something, and it was fairly significant, and that pushed out because of delivery of the contract didn't happen on time. And so both those together kind of made it -- made it a bigger than life number. I mean, we certainly missed more than we typically would ever miss an R&D number.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then on the inventory side, I think you mentioned that it would -- you expected days to come up in December. Can you talk about how channel inventories are looking? They still seem at 10 days-ish to look kind of on the lean side. Do you think inventories built or came down in the quarter? And what do you expect them to do in your channels in December?","Jon A. Olson","So I was talking earlier about -- particularly European distribution being weak, and the backlog being particularly weak from a Europe perspective in the medium-sized and small customers. And we've been doing a pretty good job with Avnet collectively to keep the inventory lean and keep it available for them and in Xilinx's inventory pot. And that's worked out pretty good because it gives them a lot more flexibility versus having to guess which of their customers might decide to order something in these kind of uncertain times. So that's worked out pretty good for us, and I don't think there's any particular supply chain issue that gets communicated with that. Overall, our inventory is moving up just because we were starting to build more 7 series or products. And since those tend to carry higher costs than the initial part of the ramp, as we build up to satisfy needs over the next couple of quarters, that dollar impact typically increases our dollars and also our days because days are just average, not specific to any individual product family. So there's not really a much of a story in inventory. I think we've got a pretty good handle on it at this point.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then on the mix, I think you might have said or I might have heard you say that wireless was 25% of overall sales. Can you confirm that? And then within your industrial, defense, aero, how big is the aerospace defense portion of it?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. Well, wireless typically runs from the low 20s to mid-20s for us, and that's -- a little lower than 25%, but approximately the number. And our industrial typically runs in the mid-30s, and that dropped as a percent as you can see our industrial percentage has dropped on a quarter-on-quarter basis and comms went up on a percent basis so...","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","So how big was defense of the -- of your business or is that within that bucket?","Jon A. Olson","Sorry. Defense has typically been in the neighborhood of 15%, and it was a little lower than 15% in this last quarter.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And one, just final one, if I may. The OpEx for the full year of $860 million, does that include your amortization charges?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, it does. It doesn't? Wait a minute, hold on a second. No, it doesn't?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","It does.","Jon A. Olson","All right, good. Two different nodding heads here from people. $860 million does include.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Moshe, when you interact with your customers, the cautiousness on the macro front, is there something qualitatively different this time than previous times? Are they preparing for kind of a prolonged multi-quarter or more short term? And I have a follow-up.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So I do spend a lot of time meeting with our customers. And I think generally, there's no sense of gloom and doom. There's just challenges on the macro side, which are pretty visible to all of us. But I don't see any huge expectation of a very severe slowdown. When you look at -- a lot of these elements are driven by a need for some political fortitude which takes time. Hopefully, it will get addressed in North America soon, and in Europe, they're starting to come together on that. And likewise, when the transition in China is going to happen, that will enable things to move forward. So the short answer is no, I don't get the sense of a huge downturn impending at this point.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And when you look at the LTE activity in Europe, that's been kind of weak from our checks. Do you expect anything coming back in the next 6, 9 months on LTE front from Europe or do you think that's going to be pretty muted?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","I think it will come later than it has in the past, and the competitive position is such -- you can see it in North America, when one carrier decides to go ahead and start generating significant advantage, it generates pressure on the others to catch up. In Europe generally, that isn't happening yet. So I do think it's several months out at this point in terms of a big deployment in Europe.","Jon A. Olson","I think there was some press release by Vodafone somewhere in the last 3 months on this thing, but I don't think we've seen anything significant with respect to our revenue.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Yes. So the 6 to 9 months is probably a good guess.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.","Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Jon, I just want to make sure the OpEx question, I got it right. So you're saying $860 million, that includes the amortization of roughly $10 million, right?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, Srini, it does include that. $860 million is all-in the full year of all of our OpEx.","Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then Moshe, it looks like there are some concerns about the China TD-LTE as far as the base station content goes. We've been hearing that a majority of these base stations are software upgradeable. I guess the question is, is that true? If so, what does that mean for your FPGA content in each of these base stations?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, we believe we have a phenomenally strong position there, and best we can tell, there's a lot of FPGA content in the product. So I don't believe that, that's going to pose an issue once the deployment starts in earnest in China. In the interim, what they're doing is, they're about to launch this next rollout of the previous generation, the 3G generation. But when 4G comes out, our product position is very strong there, and we're looking forward to that happening. And the faster it happens, the better from my perspective.","Srini Pajjuri - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one last question. On the wired business, Jon, you said it was down last quarter and looks like it's going to be down again this quarter. I'm just wondering what's going on. Is it still inventory correction or is it just demand being weak?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. There was -- it was down this past quarter more from an inventory correction basis than anything else. And it's basically weak demand. If you look at our -- all of our large customers, our top, say, 15 or so customers, which are really communications and aerospace and defense customers. The communications customers are just almost plain flat. It's over the last couple of quarters with the only exception being in the wireless base station area. Everything else just seems to be kind of chunking along and not getting a lot worse, but also not getting a lot better. And since a lot of our businesses, our revenue levels are defined by these large customers, there really isn't a tremendous amount of growth going on. So it's just -- it's weak demand, not growing demand.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jon, just a follow-up on your last comment. So I'm looking at my model here, we're in the second half of fiscal '13. If I plug in some really good growth for Q4 and then double-digit growth for next year, we'll essentially have 4 straight years of kind of flattish revenue growth. So I mean, do you guys look at that? Are you reconsidering your long term growth rates for the PLD market for Xilinx? Has this come into discussion at all?","Jon A. Olson","So the answer to your very direct question is absolutely, we've had discussions around what is going on, where the drivers of our business really are going to come from and does our investment level and growth level still -- those 2 things match appropriately to what we've been saying. So there's no doubt this is a question. And this elusive metric that we, I call it elusive because I'm the CFO around design wins. The strength of which we are winning business gives us such confidence that the revenue growth is coming. But of course, macroeconomic issues can always play around with timing and when and how that happens. But we still have very strong belief here. That being said is, we are very mindful that we're outside of our business model from a percent basis, and we'll look very hard at that. We go through our planning cycle in early calendar year 2013, and I don't know what to say. I'm not going to say that we're going to cut our growth rates as we sit right now because our design win levels are really, really high on a relative basis to anything we've ever seen. Moshe wants to make a comment here.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Chris, I mean, we are -- it's obvious to us that there are challenges there, and that's why we are curtailing discretionary spending, and we are careful on the hiring front. Having said that, the impact of the design wins in 28-nanometer is not yet visible, right? It's still a tiny portion of our business. And given our very strong and broad portfolio, as we exploit that and as that goes to market and moves into production, that's when you'll start seeing accelerated growth, right? And that can't happen soon enough from my perspective, but it takes time in our business.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Throw me in that bucket of can't happen soon enough as well. A follow-up question as it pertains to OpEx. It's jumping up this quarter as a percent, but you guys are shaving it down pretty good in fiscal Q4. I mean, are we to assume -- can we assume that if we're in this kind of sluggish environment going into next fiscal year that there are a few more levers you guys can pull on the OpEx side to keep it down?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, I think we certainly are going through -- we'll go through that process with plan depending on what we see the outlook for the top line is, and I think there are more levers that could be pulled if we get ourselves in a negative kind of growth situation again. But we're also not going to slow down technology too slow just to get back in the business model in the short term and then screw our opportunities for growth in the future. So it is a balance, and I do hear you. We're going to work through that.","Operator","And your final question for the day will be Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the earlier SSI question. Your competitor had talked about a fairly limited size for the prototype market. Can you -- understanding that you see more than just a prototyping opportunity here, can you help us size the overall opportunity for the Stacked Silicon Interconnect and how much of that is actually prototyping?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. So let me repeat and so try to quantify it. The equivalent of SSIT from the customer's perspective is like having a much larger FPGA available 2 or 3 years earlier than they could achieve any other way. And in addition, because we have a version which is heterogenous, in other words, has [indiscernible] integrated with the FPGAs, it also enables a significant growth in terms of bandwidth. And so if you look at that and you say, \"Forget about how it's implemented, right, that it's 3D and all of that, what does that -- what is the size of those markets?\" And those markets overall are several hundred million dollars per year markets, right? Now there's a subset of that which is used for prototyping, that's correct, and that prototyping is where it's used primarily by semiconductor companies or ASIC or for the few remaining ASIC designs to do early product assessment of their products. And there, as long as you have the biggest one available, which we do now, it enables -- it facilitates itself and it's repeatable. So even though those customers don't go into production, whenever they're doing a new design then they're designing new versions of these ASIC prototypes, so it's not a one-hit wonder, and it actually is quite broad and as such that's why we believe that it's several hundred million dollar market. It's the high end of the FPGA market, and it also enables us to break into what would be the midrange of the ASIC market or the sweet spot of the ASIC market, and that's a pretty big market in of itself. So trying to minimize that is probably erroneous. It's significant. And as long as there isn't an alternative, it continues until that alternative exists and typically it takes 2 or 3 years before the next generation of FPGA is there and can achieve that level of complexity. So you can assume that there's at least a 2- or 3-year edge there, which we intend to exploit very aggressively.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow up. Do you foresee people wanting to stack FPGAs with non-FPGA devices such as CPUs or ASICs in the same interconnect structure? Is that something customers want and something that you might provide?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, generally speaking, we haven't -- we are the leaders, we're the only people who have it. We have our first generation of product you can get. We have wrung out all of the issues there. The first generation had 2 elements of integration and you can assume that in the next generation, there will be more things that can be integrated on using the 3D capabilities, and then it needs to be economically viable to do that. So some applications require things like memory, some applications require other elements. We're way ahead of anyone else in terms of identifying those and pursuing them.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Rick. Sales in the March quarter increased for the sixth consecutive quarter to $609 million, up 4% sequentially and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Growth was driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 9% sequentially to a new record. Gross margin was 69.5%, at the high end of our guidance, due primarily to favorable end market mix.","Operating expense was $250 million. This was $6 million higher than guided as we accelerated some 16-nanometer tape-out expenses to extend our technology leadership and add some increased litigation expense. Operating income for the quarter increased 6% sequentially to $173 million or 28.5%.","Other income and expense was an expense of $2.2 million, better than guided due primarily to investment gains. Tax rate was 10% for the quarter due to discrete item. Our net income for Q4 was $153 million or $0.57 per share.","We are pleased to have delivered on our financial plan in fiscal 2017. We met our target of 6% revenue growth, driven by a 45% increase in Advanced Products, and operating margin was 30% for the year. This profitability led to the generation of a record $934 million in operating cash flow. Finally, our EPS was $2.32 for the year, a 13% increase over FY 2016.","Now, some key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.4 billion in gross cash and $2 billion in net cash after our debt. Accounts receivables decreased by nearly $100 million, as we collected last quarter's higher than normal receivables balance. Inventory was $227 million, up $21 million from the prior quarter, with nearly all the increase coming from our Advanced Products.","Operating cash flow was $306 million for the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $82 million in dividends, and we repurchased 1.8 million shares for $108 million, an average price of $58.45. We ended the quarter with diluted shares at 267 million, which included the impact of 15 million shares from the convertible and the warrant associated with it. For a complete explanation of the impact of these instruments on share count, please refer to our convertible FAQ on our Investor Relations website.","As we have discussed, capital allocation remains a top priority for the company. This year, we returned $855 million to shareholders through $333 million of dividends and $522 million of share repurchases. This total capital return is $90 million more than we returned to shareholders in the prior year.","Our board recently authorized an increase to our dividend for the 12th consecutive year. We continue to execute on our share repurchase program with the intention of exhausting our $1 billion authorization over the next several quarters. We currently have $680 million left on that authorization.","Now to guidance. In the June quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $600 million and $630 million. Our backlog is up heading into the quarter, and we are expecting continued growth in our Advanced Products.","On end markets, we expect the communications category to be up, industrial and A&D categories is expected to be flat sequentially. And, lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive is expected to be slightly down.","Our gross margin will be approximately 68% to 70%. We expect operating expense to decline to approximately $242 million, including $1 million of amortization. Other income will be $1 million. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 12% and 15%.","We will provide full year FY 2018 guidance at our upcoming Analyst Meeting in New York City on May 22. We look forward to seeing you all at that meeting. Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Lorenzo. I am extremely pleased with our March quarter financial results. Sales increased 4% sequentially to $609 million, marking the sixth consecutive growth quarter. Gross margin was at the high end of our range. The combination of higher sales and higher gross margin drove our strong operating profit growth.","We continue to benefit from our diversified multimarket portfolio. Five of our eight end markets increased in the quarter. The automotive and test measurement and emulation markets drove the largest incremental sales increases, and both delivered new record revenue levels. Overall, revenue growth continues to be driven by our Advanced Products, which increased 9% on a sequential basis and 45% overall on an annual basis. This category now comprises 49% overall of our revenue.","28-nanometer product family very significantly surpassed $200 million in the quarter, setting by far a very significant PLD industry record. 20-nanometer generated $60 million in sales, driven by a very broad base of markets. 16-nanometer sales grew significantly in the March quarter to a new record, significantly exceeding our forecast with sales from all of our end markets. Our Zynq SoC platform, which includes both our 28-nanometer and 16-nanometer product offerings, increased nearly 20% sequentially and now represents more than 10% of our overall revenue.","One of our key 16-nanometer customers is Amazon Web Services. Just last week, AWS announced the general availability of our FPGAs for cloud-based acceleration. Our world-class silicon technology, coupled with our optimized software tools, allow AWS to offer optimizable and programmable hardware acceleration to their users.","I'm very excited by this because this has the potential to create a new disruptive business model for our technology, where the flexibility of the programmable logic is an inherent benefit over fixed-function ASICs, thereby expanding our reach into a much broader set of customers and applications.","More broadly, our investment and exceptional execution at the 16-nanometer node has extended our competitive lead to approximately 18 months. We are now shipping 14 unique products to more than 450 discrete customers. This represents a substantial increase from last quarter, where we shipped 12 unique products to 300 customers.","Additionally, we recently announced a major expansion of the 16-nanometer portfolio with our All Programmable RF SoC product family. This is a disruptive integration and architectural breakthrough to 5G wireless with RF class analog technology. This family provides 50% to 75% power and dramatic footprint reduction, 5G, cable and wireless backhaul applications.","Lorenzo mentioned we're extremely pleased that we delivered on our commitment of 6% revenue growth for fiscal year 2017. We remain committed to delivering to our longer-term operating margin target of 30% plus.","Our June quarterly guidance of $600 million to $630 million will again be driven from broad-based growth in our Advanced Products portfolio. As I mentioned before, this is already 49% of our current business, and hence helps drive our overall revenue forward. I look forward to sharing more details on fiscal year 2018 with you at our Analyst Meeting on May 22 in New York.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much. And, Lorenzo, good to see the accounts receivable come down. That had caused a lot of consternation last quarter. Moshe, I had a question on inferencing. And I know that the investment case for Xilinx is not just on AI and machine learning, but there has been a lot of talk about it and you guys are showing up as well in the inferencing market. So my question is, help us understand some of the benchmarks. And I don't expect you to get into a blog fest with the existing or potential customer, but Google put out a TPU specs against the GPU against the CPU. Where do the FPGAs stack up? Latency, throughput, anything you are willing and able to share will be very helpful. Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. Well, I'll do my best. But realistically, we're going to provide a lot more information on this topic on May 22. So I encourage you to look for more detail then. But generally speaking, first and foremost, the most valuable element we have is actually in the flexibility, and that is inherent to the programmable logic, and that is something which is very, very, very difficult to provide in an ASIC. And similarly, it's quite difficult to provide in a similar way at least using a CPU and a GPU. And the importance of flexibility is that even though it sort of sounds like machine learning and inferencing and all of that, we are into the 70th year of hearing about it.","Reality is it's an emerging technology with very broad applicability where the benchmarks are very dynamic and the ones which are important today are going to be likely totally useless two or three years from now. And the biggest benefit we have is the fact that our devices can be programmed to match the new payloads and new algorithms, right. Now, so that's sort of the generic thing, and I think everyone sort of misses that, and that's why I'm starting with this long semi-diatribe on this issue because that sort of is something that I think the market underestimates the inherent advantage we have there.","Now, if you sort of look at a specific set of applications, generally speaking, on things which do not require floating point, we tend to have higher performance and lower power than all other options. Now, if you take one fixed application and you target a dedicated ASIC to it, yes, I'm sure they can do better, but then if anything changes then that ASIC all of a sudden becomes a lot less attractive on the new application, whereas the programmable logic can be modified to adapt to that. And so generally speaking, we have much better performance than CPUs and GPUs for everything except floating point for each application and we have performance which is generally on par to a fixed but actually the biggest benefit is in the flexibility of our products and the fact they can be adapted.","With regards to specific benchmarks we can share the numbers we have with you, and we would be happy to do that. And this is one of the reasons that we're so excited about this market. And if you sort of look at Amazon in addition to the inherent technology advantage we provide, it actually provides us with a perfect conduit to a very broad set of new customers. So both in terms of technology and access to the technology, this is a tremendous benefit for us. And we'll talk a little more about that too. I think I've overstayed my welcome on this.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.","John?","Operator","John, your line is open.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Can you guys hear me now?","Rick Muscha - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes.","Lorenzo A.

Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes, we can hear you.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Congratulations on the strong results. I guess, Moshe, my question is pretty simple. Up until about two or three months ago, a lot of our field work was suggesting that, while FPGAs were a great architecture for accelerators in the data center, there were still a lot of software compatibility issues. And I guess we've been fairly impressed over the last three or four months how quickly some of those software issues, programmable issues, have been resolved. So I guess my question to you is, relative to three or even six months ago, how is the acceleration opportunity today versus then? At last year's Analyst Day, I think you talked about $250 million of potential incremental revenue by 2020. I wonder if you'd just give us a sense of whether or not relative to those expectations the acceleration market is actually accelerating? And I apologize for the pun.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. So you're right. Last year, at our Analyst Day, we projected it to be between $200 million to 300 million in the calendar year 2020 timeframe. At the time we gave those projections, we were aware of the engagement with Amazon, but we were unaware of what they were planning on doing with it. And so for us, we have lots of customers. And actually all of the big hyperscalers are customers, but they don't always initially share what their plans are.","What has happened over the past year, and in particular with Amazon, and that became clear only at the tail end of the calendar year, so I think it was November at the very earliest that we sort of found out what it is that they wanted to do. We also detected that in order to make them successful, we needed to prioritize the software environment, which was something we were working on, but was probably at least a year away. We identified that that needed to be raised in terms of priority, and a lot of resource was put in place.","Now, they've moved very, very quickly. We have been delighted to support them with their very significant requirements, and at the beginning of the calendar year, they actually opened it up to limited release, and the limited release enabled FPGA experts to access the technology. So the technology became available in the cloud, but it was available to a limited set of customers. And when they announced general availability, then that's a much broader set of customers.","So the change is that Amazon has now legitimized this, is putting it in the cloud. The software, which was clearly a handicap we had, we have invested very heavily and now the results the customers are seeing are very positive, and there's a follow-up release less than a month from now which will even broaden the target customer base even more significantly than it does.","Now, the underlying question is how much can this do for revenue, and I think it's still too early to predict that. Clearly, the potential is there for it either to be larger or for it to happen a little earlier. It's still unlikely to impact the next 18 months in a significant way, but it is possible that by 2020, if this goes well, that the market could be larger than what we said, and this is for our technology, or it could maybe happen faster in 2019.","But what we're really trying to do is, we don't want to sort of generate any short-term frostiness because there really is not the proof in terms of deployment to justify that. There is the potential of that happening in a little further-out timeframe than what I think most people are looking at. And so there is goodness and there is goodness in the technology. There is goodness in the opportunity, and there is definitely tremendous potential with Amazon putting this up in the cloud and making it available to everyone broadly.","And they were very clear. You can look at their blog. They sort of said this is initially being deployed in one location. If that is successful, then the implication there is that there could be significant deployment in other locations, which in of itself would be an accelerator or a potential enhancer of the business. But that first deployment needs to be successful. And obviously both Amazon and Xilinx are working hand in hand to do the best we can to support it.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra from Robert W. Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Similar question in the ADAS business. How should we look at this business medium term for Xilinx? You've mentioned a high 20s market share in the past. Do you think that there is a trend where FPGAs can actually gain share against ASIC in that market? And we know the product cycles are very long. And is programmability as critical as it is in the other market that you just discussed?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, the programmability and the flexibility is valuable in this market, because this again is a market which is in flux. It is changing rapidly. What we are now deployed in is ADAS. We have a lot of design wins in advanced ADAS. Those put us in a good position to transition into the automated or autonomous driving over time. We think that this is a process which, until it really becomes mainstream and very, very broadly deployed, it has a 10 to a 15-year horizon until that sort of happens. And at that point in time, it wouldn't surprise me if it becomes significantly commoditized.","But until it gets to that point, we do believe that the programmability is a major asset that we have. And this is a market we identified early, and we think that for the next two generations of deployments over the next five to seven years, we're in a very good position. And our market share should grow a lot of the growth this current quarter in our automotive numbers, which hit a new record were due to a surge in ADAS. And we'll give more data with regards to our overall practical businesses in May, but you can be sure that automotive is likely to be the highest growing or amongst the highest growing markets for our next year projections. Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph L. Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Zynq being over 10% of revenues. I was kind of excited about that. Can you just talk a little bit about what the drivers are? And you've talked about the number of design wins that you have in Zynq, the mountain of design wins, I think you've referred to it as. Where are we in terms of monetizing that and how much do you think, how long do you think that you can grow at the rate that you have been in that Zynq product?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, if you look at the Zynq products offering, it was introduced at the tail end of our 28-nanometer, so I believe the first tape-out was at the end of 2011 for Zynq. And then silicon was probably available a year later, and we got a lot of design wins in three initial markets which it was targeted at were wireless, and it was won a lot of business in wireless. Actually it's at the core of our wireless strategy. Most of the deployment that you're seeing now in wireless at Xilinx or a lot of it is Zynq-based.","Second area, and this was a major driver for the definition of the product, was automotive, and that's a market that takes quite a bit longer, but is now hitting its stride. And the third is industrial control, and that's where we have the proverbial mountain of design wins, which are now starting to turn to revenue, and that's just a function of how long it takes.","What we're seeing in parallel is a second generation Zynq that was targeted at the high and mid range of the market at 16-nanometer, but what we've done is we've since taken the 28 nanometer and expanded it down to lower-end devices. So, you can tell from that that we expect it to be a big driver going forward and at 7-nanometer it's going to be part and parcel of a broad deployment in our technology, because we believe that at that point, 7-nanometer, it's going to be an integration play. And nearly all of our customers will use the high-performance multi-CPU cores, which are part of that in their technology.","So, if you sort of look at it, it's grown from 0% to 10% of our business. And my expectation is that it can grow from 10% to 20% much faster than it took to grow to 10%. And maybe we'll try and quantify how much faster, but it's now no longer a new wonder. And just the repeat business that we can get in of itself should be a major driver in addition to the expansion that we have. And if you go far enough into the future, it's likely that close to 100% of our business over time will be driven by the Zynq product offering. But that's probably 10 years out. That's probably not now.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of C.G. (sic) [C.J.] (27:23) Muse from Evercore.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess the question here is you guided comm and data center up sequentially. Curious if you could talk about what you've embedded in the guide for incremental growth from the data center. And then as a quick housekeeping question, if you could offer your outlook for share count for the June quarter. Thanks so much.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. So two things. So I might frustrate you by not being very precise. But in the comms, we do show data center. We do expect data center to grow meaningfully. And again that's in the context of some of our older data center business not growing as much as we would like. And in certain cases, our design wins that we've had were slowing down. So we do think that, in summary, that the data center growth, which is part of the overall comms growth, all the end other markets in the comms area we expect to be growing as well, but the data center growth will be driven by hyperscale.","Then with regard to share count, so I haven't been providing detailed share count guidance for the past couple of quarters for a couple reasons. One is I don't want to kind of signal exactly what we're doing on our buyback. And the second part is, the complexity of the convert and its impact on our diluted share count is hard to describe briefly. So I would though recommend you, CJ, go to our website. We're going to update what we expect to be the impact on diluted share count from the redemption of the convert in this quarter.","Like I said, it's fairly complex, but we've tried to make it understandable. And you will see that it will have a significant impact in this current fiscal quarter, and then because of the way the accounting is done for the share count, it will actually even translate to a further reduction in the next quarter. So I mean, I will actually, I'm happy to take a follow-up if there's something specifically you were looking for, but I'm not going to give you a precise share count guide.","C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC","No, that's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Vinh from Pacific Crest.","John N. Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Question on 5G. I think you guys have talked about your 5G trial win rate at roughly 9% plus. Also if you think about 5G as versus 4G, you've got a 3x to 5x increase in radio heads, which is an area that you historically have done extremely well. And you've also announced the RF SoC, which gives you an opportunity to expand your footprint because it integrates additional discretes. So, I was wondering if you could just put into context, how do we think about the 5G opportunity versus 4G. Right, and conceptually it sounds like a very sizable opportunity, but I'm just wondering if you could also just talk about what are the other offsets that we should be thinking about.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. So great questions, actually. There's a whole series of very detailed questions. So we will try and give you more clarity on that in May, but let me give you Reader's Digest. The broad deployment of 5G is expected to start in earnest in 2020 and we believe we're going to have a very good position there based on the design wins we have. It is indeed quite likely that at least on the radio head side there will be a larger number than was done, you know, than were deployed in 4G. And fundamentally 5G is going to be essential in terms of enabling the infrastructure or a whole host of things which are extremely visible today, like this entire industrial IoT. To do that well, the 5G technology is going to be a key enabler there.","So we absolutely agree that the potential is larger. Our technology position is very strong. We think that between now and 2020, there is going to be ongoing deployment for 4G, including there is going to be additional rounds even in China, which is now the tail end of I think the fifth round of LTE deployment. And they will do a sixth round that is expected to be about two-thirds of the size of the fifth round, but that's still a very significant number. India is going strong, and there is other countries in the world where there is deployment.","So if you look at the overall wireless business, we expect it to hover around the mid-point of, for us, our high was close to $150 million a quarter. Our low was $75 million. We expect to hover around the midpoint over the next few years on average until the 5G starts in earnest. Our technology position makes us very confident that during these next two years, all of the pre-5G deployment is likely to benefit us. And then when the real thing starts, then that's when you could see it approaching or maybe even surpassing the previous levels.","But that's a few years away in terms of hitting over $150 million per quarter. We don't see that happening any time soon. Hope that answers your question, and we'll try and give more visibility into that in May.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of William Stein from SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I'm wondering, as we head into the Analyst Day, in order to prepare for it, what should we be thinking about sort of the puts and takes that could take your top line above or below this year's roughly 6% growth?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, we'll give you an annual projection. And we're delighted that we have, if you look at one year, we have 100% hit rate in terms of hitting that number. If you look back more than one year, we have a very low hit rate. And we're very proud of actually delivering the 6% on the nose and actually just exceeding that. But we will provide you with guidance.","I think the thing that gets overlooked and despite the fact that we emphasize it again and again and again is, we benefit immensely from the multimarket portion, and that sort of provides us with a lot less volatility than most other players. And what we'll try to do is to highlight which of these markets are likely to, or have the potential of doing better, which are just likely to hit the natural growth rate and which some of them, for better or for worse are below the growth rate. And we'll sort of highlight those, but there are sort of eight disparate markets and they all tend to have somewhat different dynamics.","The ones which get the sexiest and get the most air time are data center and automotive, but we're actually doing very well on A&D. We're doing very well on test and measurement. We've done better than most other semiconductor or all other semiconductor companies on wireless, in a time where the wireless industry has not done well. So, I think the under-appreciated part is the multimarket portion. And if I have a request is that you'll come with some openness with regards to hearing about the other markets, even if they're less, have less curb appeal than the ones everyone is talking about.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","That was a very artfully phrased question, too. Good for that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Wong from Wells Fargo.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea of what you expect 16-nanometer revenues might be in the current fiscal year, fiscal 2018?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","We will give you guidelines for that in May. It's too early, but it's done great, and a lot of that is driven by the Amazon deployment, but it's not all of it. There's actually, you can just tell from the number of customers in the number of markets we're in that it's doing better. It's actually getting deployed faster than any other technology we have seen in the past and we're also benefiting from a very favorable competitive position.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And for my follow-up, can you give us any idea of whether you're seeing any pickup in defense, in sales into the defense segment?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, there was a nice pickup this quarter.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","It's generally been on an upward trend as design wins that we have, one in our 28-nanometer generation ramp in. As you know, in defense, it's a very, very long-tailed business. So at any point one time, we have multiple generations, multiple of our product generations being sold into the industry. So given our competitive position and strength of design wins and our continued design wins in large opportunities like Joint Strike Fighter, we feel very good about the business.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","It's already the third largest.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Largest business.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Market we're in, and it's not that far away from wired and wireless. Smaller than wired and wireless, but it's approaching those numbers.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back to the AWS announcement, just kind of the concept of FPGAs as a service, or available in the cloud. And kind of what size of consumers do you think would use this, whether you'd see any larger scale customers deploy it, or is this more for smaller? And then you can you just talk about competitive landscape there, if you expect you'd be the only offering or if you would see any from Altera as well?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","So there's seven big players, and we are talking to all seven of them. The one which has the largest existing deployment is Microsoft, and that is using the Intel slash Altera for that. We believe we have a product which is so much better than that, that obviously that is at the core of our success with all of the players.","With regards to the breadth of the usage, the beauty of this is, in particular in the Amazon case, is that this enables a broad new set of applications to evolve in a way which the traditional way of pursuing the business was just not capable of doing. And it is inherent to the Amazon model that they don't actually know themselves yet, because they don't have the end system expertise. They're not experts in all of these areas. What they do and what they are experts at monetizing is making it easy to use and making it available and then enabling an amazing ecosystem where the players use it. And what we are seeing and just they talked about thousands of customers applying from the very first minute, several hundreds getting access during the limited release and then being open to the potentially thousands of customers in the general availability.","Our expectation is as this unfolds, and that's why we're being cagey on providing numbers, right. That's sort of what we're trying to \u2013 we believe this could have a viral impact and not only would it be used in a public cloud sort of applications like Amazon, but when people start seeing the benefits of that, they'll just think that even for their specific applications, they could see huge improvements. And as this transition is happening into a world where machine learning is becoming broadly used for a whole host of applications, that these sort of open up and hence there's huge potential there.","Also, that's the reason that we are loath to try to quantify it yet. But yet, all of this change is quite a monumental one in terms of accessibility, in terms of ease of use, and the breadth of the benefits and the benefit of the programmability, because there are some misguided notions that an ASIC by definition is better than an FPGA. This is the one set of applications which an ASIC, due to the fact that it takes years to design and it's very rigid, you could do a wonderful job designing absolutely the wrong ASIC, and then deploy it at a time where the market has changed, whereas if you use programmable logic, you can change it in situ, in live applications and it can adapt to these new applications and benchmarks, so hence the benefits.","The other benefit is that a lot of these applications, in particular on the inference side tend to have more of a integer nature to them as opposed to the traditional floating point applications. And as a result, and it's sometimes it's a flexible integer format that they use, and there is nothing more flexible or better than programmable logic in terms of doing that. So I know I haven't quite answered your question, but I think that's the potential. Lorenzo, also?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. So I think an element of your question, Blayne, was maybe related to whether the applications on AWS are kind of nichy or small or whether there's some big entities using it. And the launch partners range obviously from some smaller entities to some very large entities, and they're doing a range of applications that are fundamental to each of the companies in the core businesses. So I do think the scaling opportunity is there and very well represented.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just one near-term question. The guidance for the June quarter for industrial, aerospace and defense being flat and then down in the broadcast, consumer and auto segment, could you give a little bit more color about the moving parts in that? And then maybe a slightly longer-term aspect of it, I know you said that automotive would be a fast grower, and you'll give us more details at the Analyst Meeting in May. But the other part of that equation, the broadcast and consumer, has been a bit of a headwind for a couple of years. So I just wondered what the trajectory of that might be over the course of the year. Thanks.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah. So the industrial A&D softness is due to program-specific things in defense primarily. The rest of the business areas are relatively going to be flat relatively quarter on quarter. In the automotive, consumer, broadcast space, as we've mentioned in this call already, we've set a record in automotive. And if you go back a quarter, we talked about kind of a low based on some inventory things. So we're going to see a little bit of dip in automotive. And by the way, though we expect a longer-term trend upward based on the strength of our ADAS design wins, we won't be surprised by some quarterly fluctuations.","But underneath that, the ADAS business is very strong. It's just kind of a quarterly correction and the rest of the end markets in that segment are flat. We will probably talk a little bit more in May about longer-term trends in audio\/video broadcast, but you're right, the industry is facing some headwinds, and we are feeling those as well.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Rosenblatt Securities.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Rosenblatt Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Moshe, can you give us your feel for your roadmap as you go from 2016 to 2017 and beyond in terms of process technology? And that is in the context of the update that Intel gave the Street a few weeks ago regarding their roadmap and their density advantages. Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, we're delighted to be with TSMC. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. Maybe professionally, it's the best decision I've ever made. We don't regret it for one minute. They are great. You know, look at everyone who has tried someone else, including Intel. Great company, great manufacturing technology, great CPU provider. The foundry business is a service business. It requires technology leadership. It requires support. It requires an ecosystem. TSMC is second to none, absolutely second to none.","I mean, that's sort of really not something I worry about and I'm not in any way understating Intel's capabilities. I'm just sort of saying, as a foundry, I think we're absolutely with the right foundry. What we now uniquely benefit from is, they have such a huge portion of business which comes to them from the wireless smartphones, which in a very, very short period of time enables them to get to incredible defect densities. If you can their investment in capacity, they have for several years now invested $10 billion every year. In terms of access to technology and support technology, in terms of addressing fluctuations, in terms of requirements, they really are best-in-breed.","So yes, Intel is great, has great manufacturing capacity. TSMC is by far the best foundry in the business, and they didn't get to having $30 billion worth of foundry business without that sort of excellence. So I'm not at all concerned about access to leading-edge technology. I believe that TSMC can provide us with that and has in the past, is now. If you remember, there was a huge excitement when Altera initially committed to Intel, and the common wisdom would be that they're two years ahead of us. I would say now they're comfortably, and this comes from customers, 18 months behind us. Right. So, we will continue to pursue TSMC and benefit from that relationship.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup.","Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey thanks, guys.

Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx delivered record revenue of $2.539 billion in fiscal year 2018, up 8% from FY 2017, and at the high-end of our guidance we provided at Analyst Day. This revenue growth was driven by our Advanced Products, which grew 28% over the previous year and broad-based growth across our end markets. All end markets outside of communications grew in fiscal 2018. Gross margins remained very strong throughout the year, averaging over 70%.","Operating margin for the year came in at 29.3%, excluding the unusual cost associated with our executive transition in Q4, our operating margin exceeded 30% for the year. For the fiscal year, Xilinx generated $1.99 of GAAP earnings per share. As we noted last quarter, the impact of tax reform on our earnings was significant. We also had the expenses related to our executive transition. Without those items, our EPS would have been approximately $2.72 a share, a growth of 17% over FY 2017.","Now for the March quarter. Sales increased to a record of $673 million as we exceeded the top end of our guidance range. We were up 7% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Our revenue was driven by broad-based growth in our Advanced Products, which were also up 7% sequentially and up 28% year-over-year. All of our primary end markets grew with particular strength in Industrial, Aerospace and Defense.","Gross margin for the quarter was 70.7%, in line with our guidance. Operating expense was $286 million. Core operating expense, including approximately $33 million of one-time charges related to our CEO transition was $253 million.","Operating income for the quarter was $190 million or 28.2%. Excluding the executive transition costs operating margin was 33%. Tax rate was 10.9% for the quarter, higher than we guided due to additional expenses related to tax reform legislation. Our net income for Q4 was $166 million or $0.64 per share.","Now I'd like to highlight a few key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the fiscal year with $3.4 billion in gross cash and $1.7 billion net cash after our debt. During fiscal year 2018, we generated $795 million in operating cash flow, and we returned $827 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Our board recently authorized an increase to our dividend for the 13th consecutive year.","In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $218 million, and we returned $253 million to shareholders in the form of $89 million in dividends and $163 million of share repurchases. We bought back approximately 2.3 million shares for an average price of approximately $71 a share.","Since inception, we have utilized $793 million of our $1 billion share repurchase program. We have repurchased 12.9 million shares at an average price of approximately $61.50 a share. We ended the year with 258 million shares, down from 267 million at the end of last fiscal year. We now have at $207 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization and are continuing to execute on our program.","Now for guidance. In the June quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $660 million and $690 million. We expect turns of approximately 40% to achieve the midpoint of this guidance. With regards to primary end markets, we expect communications and data center as a group to be down reflecting the impact of the denial order on ZTE, although the data center element will be up modestly.","Industrial and A&D will be down, will also be slightly down after several consecutive record quarters. Broadcast, consumer, automotive is expected to be modestly up. Our guidance reflects an estimate of the effect of the mandated adoption of ASC 606, which moves us from a sell-through to a sell-in model. In the next few weeks, we will be publishing on our Investor Relations website a more complete discussion of the estimated impact of ASC 606 on our financials.","Our gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 71%. We expect operating expense to be approximately $260 million. Our tax rate is expected to be between 10% and 14%.","Let me now turn the call over to Victor.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you, Lorenzo. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that our focus on accelerating top line growth has delivered record revenues of $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2018, an increase of 8% over fiscal year 2017. Growth was broad-based and driven by the strength in the majority of our end markets. I'm extremely excited about the future of our business as we execute on our mission of building the adaptable, intelligent world.","Recently, I described our strategy are to consist of three elements, data center first, accelerating revenue growth in our core markets and driving adaptive computing. I also announced a new product category, Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform or ACAP and our Everest project, which will deliver the industry's first 7-nanometer ACAP product family. We are on track for tape-out of our first ACAP product later this year. We've established significant momentum in the data center end market over the past fiscal year both developing the foundation for and building out a vibrant ecosystem.","For example, we now have trained more than 400 developers with approximately 300 in the March quarter alone, on how to develop for our AWS's Xilinx based F-1 instances. We've continued to invest in our SDAccel development environment and middleware library, making it easier for software developers to program our FPGAs using industry-standard APIs and frameworks.","As an example, we recently released a machine learning speed on the AWS F-1 environment to support for TensorFlow. We expect the data center to be our fastest-growing end market in the near term with significant revenue levels over the longer term. Xilinx has been evolving for an FPGA focused company to Zynq-based platforms and soon, ACAP platforms.","Our transformation has been underway for the last several years through the integration of powerful SoCs and through our programmable chips, developing 3D ICs, developing software development suites and creating partner ecosystems. Our Zynq SoC products are ideal for platform architectures and are a critical element of our multimarket expansion.","Our 28-nanometer Zynq and 16-nanometer MPSoC product have achieved a new sales record, growing more than 60% year-on-year. Our RFSoC family, which has a breakthrough architecture with integrated RF-class analog technology, will be in full production by the middle of this year. The RFSoC has exceptional design-in momentum with product shipped to about 30 customers to date across multiple end markets and applications. We will build on our momentum at the data center and accelerate our growth in our core markets with our new strategy for sustained, robust long-term growth and delivering shareholder value. I look forward to sharing more details about our strategy and plans for FY 2019 and beyond at our Analyst Day in May.","Let me now turn it back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you very much, Lorenzo and you can almost predict which question I am going to ask you. Accounts receivable, I know in the past they've gone up, but this time looking at two quarters in a row on a year-over-year basis now, does it have to do with the new rev rec?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","No, not really, because we haven't implemented the standard yet. We will in FY 2019. What's happening with accounts receivable, again, it's similar to what I have said before when they're high. It's the shipment patterns during the quarter. And again, in this quarter, again we had some back-end loaded shipments. So it is actually, to be perfectly candid, I'd like to drive the days down and get that gross number down and bring the cash back into the company so we'll be working on it. But there's no collectability concerns again, and it's just it's a timing thing. We just need to keep working at it.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. In the past, you have reversed it. Then my follow-up is for Victor. On ACAP, this seems to be pretty revolutionary at least the way I'm looking at it. But in terms of revenue opportunity, how much does it, what new TAM does it open up versus cannibalization of existing offerings because we're always worried about that for FPGA companies is how much of the existing business are you cannibalizing? So, if you could please explain kind of how to think about the new opportunity that'd be great? Thank you.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah I actually think that there'll be significant SAM extension. As I shared when I unveiled ACAP as well as the overall strategy is that one of the goals that we have as a company is to start enabling software developers to use our very powerful platform and the ACAP will definitely give a huge boost to that. We're not waiting for that. I mean we're doing that even today with our 16-nanometer in fact even some of our early products.","I mean, one way to think about it is, if you think about our Zynq, first generation of Zynq, and then the MPSoC which is the second-generation, that's already getting both TAM expansion as well as some refresh of existing sockets its but definitely already gotten SAM extension. ACAP is kind of a quantum leap beyond the Zynq platforms but you could look at it and say those are the closest (13:18) in terms of generation goes, okay? So I expect significant SAM extension.","And in terms of revenue we're taping out this year and most of the revenue will be out a year beyond that. And, as you know, a lot of our markets take some time to ramp but then product life is quite long.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You guys talked about embedding the risk related to ZTE in your guide to the extent you're comfortable talking numbers here, how big is that impact? And, I think there was a report about the DOJ investigating Huawei as well. So again how should we handicap that part of your business as well going forward?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So I think I want to just start with saying we don't have any 10% customers which we would be obligated to disclose obviously nor do we really have anyone that's close. But with respect to ZTE, and I think I'll answer in advance some of the questions that may come up, we are certainly aware of the denial order and we are certainly in compliance with the denial order.","And as we went through the quarter and into our guide you should look at the broader strength of the business and the relative proportion of communications with respect to our business to get a sense for how we can get to another strong quarter despite these headwinds with ZTE. So with Huawei specifically we're aware obviously of the press report on it, and we're just monitoring the situation.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So for ZTE is it fair to assume that you guys are assuming pretty much $0 revenue going forward?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","For this quarter?","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","But we did have two weeks of business before the denial order.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay got it. And then as a quick follow-up, Victor, on your ACAP business I think in the press release you talked about spending about $1 billion in R&D over the past four years on this platform, which obviously, isn't necessarily a small number for you guys. As we think about R&D over the next couple of years, should we expect similar growth in your R&D profile, or do you think perhaps, the growth rate in R&D could come off a little bit now that you're over the hump?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, let me just say. I believe this is the first time we ever kind of shared the level of investment for a particular program. So I'm going to give a little context there. Overall, it's not entirely, I mean, it's not at all unusual that we have to invest a fairly long period of time and prior to tape-out, there's a lot of investment that goes into it even before your very first tape-out. So in that qualitative respect, Everest is no different but on an absolute basis because of the, how powerful that platform is, it's a new product category, there is, on a relative basis, more investment and it is 7-nanometers. So of course, 7-nanometers of advanced technologies is also complex and requires additional investment, but I do want to be clear that it's not like fundamentally different.","We have fairly long development cycles, and we have extremely long and robust revenue cycles to go with that. In terms of overall OpEx guide. I think we're going to be discussing at (17:15) where we're going to be at Analyst Day. So I don't think it's appropriate for me to share that at this point. But I would say, I've been pretty consistent in saying, we're always trying to balance the right thing between investing for sustained long-term growth and to an earlier question things like SAM extension but also giving good return to the shareholder. So we always try to do a thoughtful balance of the two.","Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","You're next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask you in the consumer bucket if you've seen a tailwind from cryptocurrencies, just kind of curious, most of the currencies have fallen off a bit, I was just kind of curious to your outlook of that into June? And maybe if you can just address at a high level your positioning on any future generations, there's been a lot of talk about new boxes, just curious your positioning there, as maybe an offset if some of the currencies pull back?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Sure. I mean, as you know, the last quarter is the first time we ever talked about crypto because it was becoming somewhat material, and we did feel that while it's very volatile, we see that we are supporting those customers, we're trying to, of course, building products and trying to make them successful. But if you recall, we did say that we were talking about low $10 million kind of exposure as opposed to what you guys hear from like the GP world, for instance. I would say nothing's really changed from that. And again, and we all know that it's volatile, so that's also not changed. The number, the volatility's baked into the current guide. And again, we'll discuss that a bit more maybe in the Analyst Day.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then I just wanted to ask about the strength in Industrial, A&D, maybe just some comments on the sub segments there as well as slightly down into June. What are you seeing that maybe it's moderating the June?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So a couple of things moderating the June. So we've had a string of record quarters in test measurement and emulation specifically, which was one of the drivers of the strength for the year. And we've also had a couple of very good quarters in a row of industrial, the aerospace and defense part of Industrial, Aerospace and Defense. So those things are a little off, but there's some volatility always in that. And there's been offsetting strength in industrial scientific and medical piece of that, of the business. So all in all, I think the general trend is up. If you go back through the quarters, some will be stronger than others on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but that collection of end markets that we call industrial and aerospace and defense has been quite strong for us through the year.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. First question, as you think about hitting 10% year-over-year growth in the March quarter, and you're midpoint of the guide, almost at that level. Curious if that's a sign of a new normal for you guys as you broaden up the breadth of your portfolio, and you bring in new offerings into the data center? Would love to hear your thoughts on how we should think about the trajectory here?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah, it's Victor. So as I said, when we unveiled the strategy, we are pushing growth more vigorously. I took over being CEO last April, so really have had sales under me for the full year and while we didn't come out with a strategy statement, I certainly as owning sales and marketing, drove that and then just earlier in the year, we came out very explicitly and said that.","So again, you'll hear more at the May Analyst, but absolutely, we have been pushing more aggressively on growth and that's a combination of just doing really well in our core business as well as seeking areas of new growth. The data center continues to be building well, but it's not very material revenue right now and because it's an emerging area it have kind of some friskiness, but we're very happy with them there, but certainly as Lorenzo already covered, a lot of our core businesses, A&D from a year was a record, TME is a record, ISM, industrial was strong. So we have broad strength, and we're going to continue to drive that as hard as we can.","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","And if I could just ask a quick follow-up. Lorenzo, you've got I think $1.7 billion in net cash. You're on track to $900 million-plus free cash flow per year. I think you've been buying back around $500 million per year. Would you consider being more aggressive, considering the trend line that we're seeing here from a free cash flow perspective?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So I think the overall capital allocation strategy is yet another thing we'll address in greater depth at our Analyst Day. But I will tell you that the principles have not changed, which is first and foremost, we want to invest in growing our business. Now historically, we have been mostly doing that with organic means, and we've been more, I guess, open recently to considering inorganic opportunity as well, but we still continue to pay a dividend. We did grow our dividend again this year, and then a portion of our capital allocation will always be allocated to share repurchase. But beyond that, more specifics, you'll hear later. I don't know if, Victor, if you want to flesh out any other thoughts on that?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","No. I think (23:35) I'll also share that we got a new strategy. We're driving for growth. The inorganic means is a tool. And I think if we see opportunities that align strategically, also meets the right of course objectives we have for revenue and profitability, we'd exercise that tool. So I think that's what Lorenzo was saying, if we start seeing that, there might be some obvious modulation to take that into account, but otherwise after that, we'll continue the same basic philosophy I suppose. That help?","C.J. Muse - Evercore ISI","Thank you guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good afternoon. Looking at your core product, it was up 6% sequentially. Typically, that's a line item that tends to decline, so would you characterize the strength in the March quarter as a one-time, and what drove their increase?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","No, I think overall, it was up from the prior quarter but it's a similar run rate as the earlier quarters of this year. It is the, obviously, the older products and over time, we would decline. But I think it's part of our business that we have not lost focused on. We have not lost focus on, and we continue to drive, along with the Advanced Products portfolio. So in general, it should decline, but it is not any different from where it is at the beginning of the year.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then you had mentioned in prior quarters having a significant lead in 5G and earning pretty much all the proof-of-concept. As we get closer to mass deployments, any quantification of the opportunity, perhaps from a content perspective, versus 4G or timing, and whether 5G you think gives you confidence that it can offset some of the 4G declines that we are going to expect next year?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","I guess what I'd say is the overall message that we've been in all these proof-of-concept and early deployment, that's certainly true. And we've also said, in terms of more meaningful production ramp, that's more in the 2020 timeframe. We believe that continues to be true.","I do think in terms of content, it quite varies a lot because 5G is not just traditional macro base stations, right? It's small cell, there's IoT, there's also a multi-band. So I think diversity and the types of systems that are falling under quote-unquote the 5G umbrella is way broader than any other previous generation. So it's really kind of a hard thing to say. You'd actually have to narrate it more down to say what our content level is.","Again, I don't want to the sound like a broken record, but we could add more color in the investor conference. And then certainly, of course from a wireless perspective, now with the ZTE denial, there's also just we'll have to see how that unfolds and again, we're not going to have any further comments now but hopefully, there'll be more information by the time the investor conference occurs.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Vinh with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","John Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up question on the comms business. Obviously, you've seen year-over-year declines the last three quarters. There's apparently a lot of headwinds with the ZTE ban and kind of declines in kind of carrier CapEx this year in China. Is there an opportunity, do you see, for the comms business to stabilize this year, or should we take a more conservative view and assume that we're going to see slight declines until we get to 5G in 2020?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah again with the newness and the lack of solid information at this point of the ZTE situation, it's really hard for us to comment now. We again, we've fully contemplate that fully complying with denial in this whole quarter. We certainly hope by the time we have the investor conference we have better visibility on that. But, some of the other trends minus that recent development continues to be true, right, everybody knows CapEx is actually trending down until 5G really takes off.","In one sense, even though there's a lot of people saying that the initial deployments are earlier but the volume when the verbiage was sustainable, back again I don't see any change from around the 2020 timeframe. But counter balances, things like the RFSoC which is really as disruptive, there's no product like that, we're very confident about the traction that that product's going to have, not only 5G but other markets. So, there's some really good things but I do think that especially in particularly in light of the near term thing it's hard for us to comment on modeling this.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Right, yeah.","John Vinh - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. And then my follow-up question for you Victor is on ACAP. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more commentary on what you think ACAP is and is not. My understanding is that ACAP is going to have kind of B-share cores and what MPSoC is, is this something that you primarily envision for kind of a more embedded in edge applications or do you think ACAP is something that can be applied within the data center and can be used without need for discrete GPUs?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah, that's a great question. I mean I see ACAP being broad that it will be at the edge, in the cloud, I mean pretty much end to end. Obviously it's a scalable architecture. So like some of our architectures' today that can scale from pretty very cost and power focused applications to sort of pretty much performance is number one criteria or objective. So I think it has that breadth.","In terms of what it is, I mean it is already a heterogeneous multi-core architecture, right? And there are elements that we will share through the course of the year, a little more technical detail that will help people better understand why it is such a quantum step forward. I think that it certainly will be able to displace other embedded processes in some cases but if I look at the broader scope of things, CPUs will be around. I think GPUs will have its place.","I think ACAPs will be ACAP based systems will also be a more mainstream targeted platform and it's going to be in the long run, also a very significant platform so not just in the cloud but in the edge, of course and it's multimarket. So you shouldn't think of it just in terms of the cloud. So you'll hear more and that's why I say we've already seen SAM extension and movement for people developing towards the Zynq and FPSoC and ACAP it's just going to take that a big step forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of sort of follow-ups on end markets, can you remind us what the goal was in the server acceleration market? I think you had a revenue goal by 2020? And if you could maybe remind us or refresh that? And similarly on automotive, I know that there's been good adoption of your products in certain ADAS applications, if you could update us on that end market that'd be great. Thank you.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes, I think in the past, you sort of said it, data center could be in the range of $200 million to $300 million, call the midpoint $250 million by 2021. We did say that we will update that estimate at the investor conference, but you can qualitative, it will be significantly more than that. We really see that opportunity as being much broader, much larger, and we're going to go and go after that opportunity more aggressively, obviously, with the first element of the strategy being data center first.","So you'll hear more about that in May. On the automotive side, again, automotive continues to grow and of our automotive business, roughly 70%, 75% of it's ADAS and the majority of that is Zynq-based. And if I look at the ADAS segment that continues to grow more than the general automotive segment, and it's been going strong and it's largely been, 28 nanometers, the first-generation Zynq. So we've had for the past year, significant wins in design and activity with the MPSoC, the second generating Zynq, but those things have not really gone to production, right.","So again, as you know, automotive is still a pretty long development cycle, and then ramped production. So I'd say, we expect the ADAS to continue to grow but the next kind of big driver is when the MPSoC, the 16-nanometer stuff kicks into production. We are seeing some of that, that's still advance ADAS, we are seeing some of that going to autonomous driving, but we think ACAP, right, which, again, it covers multi-markets, including automotive. ACAP, that will be the platform that goes more into autonomous vehicles. Okay. So that's, to help you with the kind of the road map succession.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yes, helpful. Thank you.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. I wonder if I could follow up on the inorganic growth comment and maybe if you could just kind of tell us the scope of things you might think about there. I mean, you've talked about being more than an FPGA company but so far, all of this has been sort of things like Zynq and RFSoC, that are attached to an FPGA fabric, is that still the thinking that this is going to be very FPGA-centric, or would you \u2013 how adjacent are the opportunities that you might be looking at?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes, Joe, I mean, I guess, what I'd say is, obviously, I can't talk about any specifics, I'd say, it would be to look to see how we can accelerate our strategy, which data center is a bigger element, right, and just again, our opportunity in the data center is quite broad, right, like, a lot of people think of data center is just on the compute side, right, but we really play in compute acceleration, we play in storage as well as networking, and there's really as you well know, there's a lot of disruptions at all three of those areas. So one way you can think about it, just within that element of our strategy, we could actually look at potential opportunities at any of those sub-segments.","Now the second element of strategy is to so accelerate the growth in our core business, so that also \u2013 so I'm not taking in any way taking off the table what may not be on the chess board, things related to some of our core business, okay, but it is going to be driven about what's going to really drive our growth and some of the directional things you want to do. If I look at the third element just talking about in general driving adaptive computing, that's more of a feature kind of a strategy. So it could also be in that sense, you could say, it could also be technologies and things that help drive that.","So, yes, again, as you can imagine, of course, I can't give any specifics, but I think we'll be looking quite broadly anything from, which we've done before, talking from technology all the way to actually significant businesses.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And then I wanted to ask about the strength in Zynq. You talked about 60% growth. I mean, it looks like that's, sorry, you crossed over 10% of revenues at one point in the year, it seems like then drove a health portion of your growth for the year. What's the right way to think about that, is that sort of your growth, there's a higher attach rate of Zynq, and so it's growing that much, or is it actually kind of driving new TAM opportunities and new revenue opportunities?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes. So there's a very important aspect of Zynq that you have to keep in mind, and Victor alluded to it earlier when he was discussing automotive. The first Zynq platforms, our 28-nanometer platforms, we launched, it was a SAM expansion play for us. It opened markets for us that we weren't as well suited for in the past and with a programmable platform we were able to address new markets, and ADAS is a great example of it.","Then with the second-generation 16-nanometer MPSoC, we're expanding that and reaching into even more markets. So it is a fundamentally market expansion play for us. It took a little bit longer as we've acknowledged in the past for it to ramp than we expected, but it is now, I think, a core part of our product strategy going forward. And because of the nature of Zynq as a platform, we think it's durable and sticky going forward. So we'll continue to expand our markets and it helps us grow with customers as well. Victor, you want to add anything?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes, no. I mean, again, I think the key thing that we're seeing, as I mentioned, this thing of platforms, we're seeing that cut across all segments, frankly. No one's doing, deploying single customized solutions, everybody's moving to platforms. And again, I think its part of the overall thrust of things wanting to be intelligent as well as connected, and so based on that even companies that traditionally have done point solutions aren't doing that. So I think Zynq is just an ideal turning point system core product for those kind of platform architectures.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong results. Lorenzo, I apologize if I missed the detail. It sounds like you guys are going to provide some further information, but just relative to the accounting change that starts in the June quarter, is there any way to quantify the magnitude? Is it a one quarter issue that then subsides into September? How does it I guess change the trajectory of revenue throughout the year? And how big of an impact is it to the June quarter guide?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So I'll answer the question first with kind of a more qualitative explanation of what's going on, not just for you, but for other people who might be interested. So, and then I'll talk about how we expect it to impact our business long-term. So, this is a change which moves us fundamentally, as I said, in my remarks from a sell-through model to a sell-in model, and the management of inventory in the channel become particularly important, and we have started to work with our channel partners to implement programs to manage that. And we're managing that inventory with these new processes pretty rigorously. So as we moved into this fiscal year we managed down the inventory in the channel and it probably will be some degree of restocking through the year. Over time that aspect of our business should trend with our overall business.","In other words, the channel is a key part of our structure. So it should be something you look at and it trends with the business. Disti inventory levels should level, should stay at, get to a steady state in the future and then stabilize on kind of on a days basis like other inventory. But there will be movements up and down over time. So I'm not quantifying it specifically for this quarter because we're just, we're going to manage through it with our channel partners to get to the right level for their customers. But we are certainly going to be transparent about it when we disclose our results.","The quantitative aspect of it will be something that we will be able to show you in more detail with the release that I mentioned also in my comments. So I'll give you some context for the history of its impact on us and obviously, the basis for comparing FY 2019 to history, so.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But Lorenzo, just so I understand, so the June quarter to the extent that you have product in the channel today that was on sell-through and is going to sell-in, will you get a revenue benefit in the June quarter?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Will you repeat your question? I heard it but I'm not sure I understood it.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Will there be a positive revenue benefit? Other companies who have gone through this transition have seen a one-time increase in revenue as they've taken stuff that's already in that channel waiting for sell-through recognition and turned it into sell-in recognition. Will you see a similar impact in your June quarter guide or not?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","So I don't know that the dynamics are exactly the same as those you're referencing, but I'd say the higher-level point, we expect it to be positive this quarter because of the way we've managed the inventory through this transition.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Perfect. That's helpful, and then Victor as a follow-on you did a good job talking about the acceleration opportunity. I'm just kind of curious, when you specifically look at the investment in the software stack in that market, what inning would you say you're in relative to that development? I guess more importantly, to what extent does that work help you exploit other markets across your end markets? And where do you think it would be particularly helpful going forward?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yeah, I would say we made tremendous progress last fiscal year and we have plans I think even continue to build on that and make tremendous progress this fiscal year. I think I've shared and just candidly that we have had great progress and we are not saying we're done. I mean, this is going to be a multi-year thing. Having said that, we are seeing the fruits of that. I mentioned some of the developer training and other things that we're seeing.","And then in terms of, is this only something that would help us in sort of the data center area or do we see it elsewhere. We absolutely see it elsewhere, absolutely. Because even our traditional customers in most cases have, virtually almost all of the sizable customers, have more software developers, more systems people than they have hardware people of any sort, ASIC, FPGA of any sort.","And even though if you have plenty of FPGA expertise, us enabling, providing development suites and other things, libraries and so forth, third parties that can also bring in other domain expertise to help them develop at a much higher level of design abstraction and bring new products and new capabilities to market very rapidly, is, resonates with them.","And so we definitely have customers in comms that are interested in some of the things we're doing in cloud and in auto. I mean, I think it's no secret, right, there's a lot of big players, people that have some significant programs that kind of cross pollinate. So, but I think moving all the way out there, I mean, that takes a bit longer because of the fact it's just in the nature of some of those markets are a little bit stronger. But we definitely see that interest already, no question about it.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's helpful. Thanks guys and congratulations.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. I just wanted to follow-up on the data center comments. Victor you said that the update's likely to reflect a much bigger TAM opportunity than $250 million by, I guess, calendar 2021 that you'd discussed before. Can you give us a sense as to the linearity? Is it something that you expect growth will be slower and then suddenly balloon around that timeframe? Or is this more of a linear process? Thank you.","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","I don't think it's linear. But of course, it's always at your peril, sort of guess and describe the tech shape of an inflection point. But I think I've been saying for a while that, look, we're laying foundation, we're building ecosystem, we're building that software development environment that improves the ease of use, lowers the barrier to developers, so on and so forth. ACAP is going to take it to a next level, but I think we've been pretty consistent that it's a midrange long-term thing.","That said, it's not just going to be this linear thing. I do feel that at some point, we get enough applications, enough developers, we've made it easier. We've educated people. We have the mindshare that people won't \u2013 our thinking was always, oh yeah, that's the FPGA leader, right? We're the inventor of the ACAP, and the ACAP is a hardware and software programmable platform that is going to have legs from end-to-end, right, from the edge to the cloud. And I think that over time, that will give us very robust growth. But and again, you'll hear more of what we think in the investor conference but calling the exact shape, of course, I think that's probably not realistic.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Kellan Grenier - Nomura Instinet","Hi. This is Kellan Grenier for Romit. Thanks for taking our question. I was just wondering another follow-up on ACAP we were just looking for an update on how you're thinking about the number of tape-outs at the 7-nanometer node. So we assume that spending implied somewhere in the range of 15 to 20 tape-outs at 16-nanometer. And I know you mentioned last year's Analyst Day, that given the heightened spending commitment you could have smaller number of tape-outs for 7-nanometer, while achieving the same kind of broad offering, so just wondering if there's any update there?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Yes. I don't think we ever gave the exact number, and I wouldn't do that again. I would also say that obviously, you have \u2013 you guys just want to know tape-out over what period of time, too, and we're not going to give that level of precision. I would say that I believe the ACAP is such a powerful architecture. I see 7-nanometers a long lived node, if you will. We're developing the architecture to be modular, excuse me, and quite scalable.","In some respects, you could say over the fullness of time, there may be more tape-outs, but tape-outs per unit time, obviously, we'd try to make sure that, that's the right balance. And also because, I think we've done so much innovation in architecture that also means that it's not like we have to feel like we need to get to the 5-nanometer node as rapidly.","Because of course, 5-nanometers is going to be \u2013 we've been investigating and working on that, and working with TSMC, but it's not cheap technology, right? So I don't think it's as simple as the tape-outs going down. I mean \u2013 but again, I think really as that gets reflected in OpEx when we talk about how you should think about the FY 2019, you kind of get a sense of that.","Kellan Grenier - Nomura Instinet","That's helpful.","Operator","Your next \u2013 your last question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Philip Lee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. This is Philip Lee on behalf of Chris Danely. Thanks for letting me ask a question. You guys mentioned you're seeing some impact from 5G in 2020 in terms of production ramp. Are you seeing any benefit from any pre-5G activity right now or next calendar year?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","I mean, we're definitely seeing benefit, because we're having great engagements with the customers and everybody's looking at \u2013 5G is quite disruptive. People are rethinking architectures, how they architect. Again, these systems which are far, far, far more than just simple macro base station. I also mentioned the RFSoC being a disrupted device. People are re-architecting how they're doing the radio. It supports more than just 5G, it's in massive MIMO, in general, which doesn't have to be 5G, right, as well as in the other applications.","So yeah, I think the customer \u2013 the customer engagement level is great. We are learning and our customers are learning of our new capability. And I do think over the longer stretch of time, that's a great opportunity. But again, in terms of revenue ramp, we continue to see that's more of a 2020 timeframe. But, yeah, we've definitely seen good deployment of the early proof of concepts in the product.","Philip Lee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Victor. And as a follow-up, you talked about your 7-nanometer progress there. Can you tell \u2013 can you remind us where you line up against the competition? How far of a lead do you think you have ahead of them?","Victor Peng - Xilinx, Inc.","Well, I haven't really heard that much about the details of exactly what they're doing And I would also say the following is that, I mean, I'm sure you \u2013 well, you may be referencing our traditional competition, now part of Intel. And certainly, we keep an eye on that and everything. But, really because of the breadth of what we're doing now, we compete against sort of non-traditional alternatives as well, right. Be that earlier you're in CPUs, GPUs in some areas, ASICs, I think the ACAP architecture is really a phenomenal leap and I feel very good about what will happen in our competitive position.","We've had the 3P, you don't really hear us talking about it, because as far as I'm concerned, that's almost like table steaks now. And obviously, the R&D team is not going to want to easily feed that, but it's not just about getting to a next node and doing the next evolutionary thing.","Now we're looking at a, quite a step forward. So I feel really good about our competitive position, but I think it's much broader than maybe the traditional competition, which we've heard very little of and I haven't heard anything like the kind of architectural innovation we are doing with it, so.","Philip Lee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Xilinx, Inc.","Okay, I just want to clarify in the statement I made. When I was reading my remarks, I talked about our fourth quarter operating expenses. I said we had $286 million of GAAP operating expenses, and then I misspoke when I brought in the concept of our executive transition costs. I should have said $286 million less $33 million of executive transition cost landing at $253 million, which is how we base the 33% operating margin non-GAAP number for the quarter.

Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov CEO and Jon Olson CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the December quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.

These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live and can be accessed from our Xilinx's Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $566 million, up 7% sequentially and at the high end of our guidance. We experienced exceptional new product growth during the quarter driven by our 28-nanometer 7 series products and 20-nanometer UltraScale products.","End market strength was broad based with Communications and Industrial and Aerospace and Defense recovering as anticipated. The Broadcast, Consumer, and Automotive category was down slightly driven primarily by Automotive which was impacted by the timing of customer purchases. We expect Automotive to post strong growth in the March quarter and to increase by 30% in the full fiscal year 2016.","Gross margin was 68.5% for the quarter. In addition to the expected impact of customer mix shift to our larger customers, gross margin was impacted by higher than anticipated production ramp cost associated with the aggressive introduction of our new products. Our March quarter guidance incorporates a small impact from these costs.","Operating expenses including $2 million of amortization expense or $228 million slightly lower than expected as a result of disciplined spending. Other income was a net expense of $5 million, better than anticipated due primarily to higher investment income.","The tax rate for the quarter was 15.6%. There were two discrete tax items impacting the rate. There was a $0.03 per share benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and a $0.05 per share negative impact due to a change in the amount of foreign earnings for which U.S. tax is provided.","Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $290 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow for the quarter was positively impacted by net improvement in working capital driven by a reduction in receivables and inventories.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 270 million. There was a 10.6 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions related to dilution Russia associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 2.1 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and a $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.","Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $17 million sequentially. We expect inventories to be down again in the March quarter.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year 2016. Our backlog heading into the March quarter is up slightly. We are forecasting continued growth in 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products.","We expect Communications to be flat with increases in wireless offsetting decreases in wired. Industrial and Aerospace and Defense is forecasted to be down slightly with decreases in ISM and Test, offsetting increases in Defense.","Lastly, we're expecting Consumer, Auto and Broadcast to be up driven by Automotive which is forecasted to have a record quarter. As a result, we're expecting total sales to be approximately flat sequentially.","The mid-point of this guidance is predicated on a returns rate of approximately 48%. Gross margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%. Operating expenses for the March quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million including $1 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles.","Other income and expense for the March quarter will be a net expense of $6 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 267 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be between 13% and 14%. The increase in the tax break forecast is a result of the previously stated changes.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. I'm very pleased we delivered a significant growth quarter with revenue hitting the high end of our guidance. Overall, six of our eight end markets grew demonstrating the strength of our highly diversified multi-market portfolio.","Particular, I'm gratified that this growth was driven by an exceptionally strong surge from our new products category, primarily our latest 20-nanometer and 28-nanometer production node which delivered an 18% sequential quarterly increase.","December quarter 28-nanometer sales grew significantly staying a new record revenue level. 28-nanometer revenue growth benefited from broad-based sales contributions from Industrial, Broadcast, Defense, Test and Measurement and Consumer markets, in conjunction with a significant forecasted recovery in the Communications market.","The current March quarter driven again by a majority of our end markets, we expect to repeat this trend and set a new quarterly 28-nanometer revenue record.","Similarly, 20-nanometer revenue in the December quarter is significantly exceeded the $20 million target we had set last quarter. No 20-nanometer competition, the Virtex UltraScale high end family continues to represent the largest percentage of our20-nanometer sales.","Additionally our Kintex UltraScale family demonstrated significant sales momentum with revenue doubling in the quarter. Looking forward to the March quarter, driven by many of our end markets and led by Test and Measurement, Defense and Consumer, we expect 20-nanometer sales to exceed our new $25 million quarterly target.","These business successes both the 20 and 28 nodes are being bolstered by the significant milestones we have achieved with our 60-nanometer UltraScale+ family extending our clear industry into leadership.","Since the September quarter, we've already shared the industry's first 60-nanometer all programmable MPSoC to tens of customers. This broad customer shipment milestone was achieved a quarter ahead of schedule enabled by the excellent functionality of our first 60-nanometer silicon.","More recently, we received silicon of our 60-nanometer Virtex silicon which is exhibiting similarly pristine functionality. Consequently, we plan to ship it to customers by the end of January significantly ahead of our original schedule.","In addition, we take out additional 60-nanometer devises last quarter and we fully expect to continue this accelerated ramp of new product tape outs throughout fiscal year 2017 to build up upon and expand our time to market advantage.","The silicon leadership position is being complimented on the software front by our enabling broad public access to design tool support for the 60-nanometer UltraScale+ family.","The breakthrough capabilities of the 60-nanometer UltraScale+ product family coupled with our very significant first mover advantage make it uniquely suited for high growth applications ranging from mixed generation front driver assistant, industrial internet-of-things to 5G wireless.","Lastly, following the October announcement of our strategic partnership with Qualcomm for compute acceleration in ARM-based servers, Xilinx and IBM announced a similar collaboration to enable compute acceleration in servers based on the power architecture. This collaboration is expected to enable high performance and energy efficient FPGA-enabled work load acceleration of rapidly growing applications.","Notwithstanding the recent turbulence in the global market continued focus and deliver upon the elements we can control, namely our total technology execution, our ability to expand the serviceable market, utilizing our leadership portfolio and our emphasis on maximizing shareholder value.","Now, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Your first question comes from William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein","Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good quarter. Moshe, I want to address a comment that I believe you made on the last quarter call about Xilinx having passed through the bottom and that the company sees growth in the coming quarters and I think one of the specific comments was more upside risk than downside risk.","Guidance for the next quarter is I think seasonal or maybe slightly below that and I'm wondering if you can give us an update on sort of where you anticipate we are in the cycle, ignoring perhaps what you read in the papers and see in the markets, but based more on backlog and customer discussion. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay, Will, as you look over the past couple of years, clearly we had a challenge in terms of our revenue and what we identified was there were two elements -- significant elements that were challenges for us. We're a multi-market company, so we're very diversified and I think that's generally good, but the two challenges we had were on the A&D front and on the wireless front and wireless depending on the point in time is typically north of 20% and A&D can be in the mid-teens, depending on the cycle and those two markets hit low points.","The low point for wireless we believe was in the June quarter and the low point for A&D was in the September quarter and so those two markets which were a bit of a drag now we believe are in recovery mode and what we're seeing is generally speaking on most or all of our markets we're seeing growth.","It isn't linear so it sort of goes up and goes down a little, but generally speaking, we think the worst is behind us and we expect to see over the next two quarters better results than we have seen in the past.","And it's driven by a very strong technology cycle, so it's driven by the 28-nanometer and the 20-nanometer now hitting record revenue -- as they hit records in the December quarter, we expect them to hit higher records in the March quarter.","This sort of impacts of the 14 weeks versus 13 weeks, we could sort of -- we've generally modeled that as between 2% to 3% in terms of benefiting from that this past -- during that obviously won't -- we won't have that in the current March quarter. So, we do think that what you're seeing is regardless of that you're actually seeing some growth on an apples-to-apples comparison.","Beyond March, we're low to give predictions and we're probably going to give predictions on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward because of the choppiness in the market. So, that's sort of the Readers' Digest version. I could spend a whole hour. Hopefully that helps.","William Stein","It's helpful. If I can have one follow-up please? I know that it's very early days, but with your primary competitor being acquired by Intel, I imagine that over time, there may be differences in competitive dynamics on the one hand in the data center opportunity and on the other hand in sort of the long tail applications. And I'm wondering if you're seeing early signs of that or maybe you can perhaps preview what you anticipate from a competitive dynamic perspective in the next few quarters? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, with regards to data center in particular, you know it's an emerging market, its emerging market for everyone. It would be very correct to say that Intel is by far the market leader due to their very strong position on high performance servers and that helps them and undoubtedly, they will leverage that to help them keep as much as they can of that market.","Our expectation is that notwithstanding that element, there is an expectation of coming solutions coming to market be they compete in architectures, the two that are obvious are the ARM and the POWER ones even on the x86 front, we believe that we can provide a lot of the big players in the market a differentiated solution.","So, no, I believe that that market; there's growth opportunity for us. I would say it's definitely the market where Intel has the full position. It would be foolhardy to state anything other than that with that with regards to that market in the x86 world. In the non-x86 world, it's sort of ours by and large.","With regards to the other markets, I think it's fundamentally driven by the customers looking for who has the best technology solution which at this point as you look at the 28-nanometer and 20 and our position on 16, we clearly have tremendous leadership and our market share is growing there.","We have leadership on the software front and we clearly have the service demeanor which is important to this customer -- to customer in these markets. So, I think that it's a growth opportunity for us. We don't take anything for granted, we need to continue to deliver leadership and the best support and our intention is to continue doing that. So that's another long answer.","William Stein","Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Just wanted to follow-up on the Industrial and Aerospace segment. Jon a clarification of the moving parts within that. I think you talked about that being down as an entire segment but the A&D side of it being up. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the industrial side, OEM versus demand and especially given in all of the uncertainty macro wise industrial data points are very helpful to us? Thanks.","Jon Olson","Sure. In this past quarter both the Industrial, Aerospace and Defense and Test and Measurement were all up sequentially and then the forecast, the guide was to have industrial down Test and Measurement down and Aerospace and Defense up so I was just wasn't 100% sure of which quarter you were referring to when you made those comments so I want to be clear on that.","So aerospace and defense as Moshe pointed out earlier did bottom out in the September quarter and we're starting to see strength in that business particularly in many of the defense areas and I know the movement and the change in some of the things going on in the budgetary process is starting to, we're starting to see some general goodness in terms of programs and emerging things going on there.","But most of our business comes from -- current business comes from existing programs and we're just seeing a very good continued very good penetration of products as are quite frankly our 65-nanometer products are growing in that categories and there's a big latency issue relative to the revenue ramp.","But we're also seeing really good 28-nanometer growth over and above what we've seen maybe historically for a new product category growing, so I think our strength there is continuing to fill and grow Aerospace and Defense. And that's a U.S. and European statement more than it is any other geography from the military perspective.","Then in industrial, it's pretty choppy. We're seeing overall growth in industrial from a full year to full year basis but by geography, it is kind of up and down. In this particular quarter, this past quarter we had stronger numbers out of Japan than anywhere else and everything else was kind of flattish to down -- flat to down kind of situation, so it continues to be challenging in China and Asia-Pacific as well as Europe where we have a significant strength set of customers so it's not like it's cratering and going down it's just kind of a very choppy environment for us in industrial.","Ross Seymore","Great, that's helpful. If I could sneak in one other more housekeeping, 8-K you put out along with your results tonight that had a change of control provision. To the extent it\u2019s possible and I know it might be a little bit difficult but can you give any color as to the catalyst behind those agreements?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, let me take that and I actually lost the big bet because I have expected that to be the first question to be asked, but thank you for asking that.","Ross Seymore","Sorry, I was late.","Moshe Gavrielov","No, you're fine. So you know there is very clearly massive consolidation which is happening in the semiconductor world and the general expectation is that will continue. Having said that, we really don't comment on market speculation or rumors and there have been numerous ones.","What we are doing is basically aligning the change in control arrangements for the company\u2019s executive management to be in line with those which are common for public companies both in our industry and actually across industries and it's just, it just happened now.","It was the result of some feedback we got or the Board got from an external consultant that they had engaged to look at these issues and that was put in place as a result of the recommendations from the external consultant, so that's sort of the entirety of it.","Ross Seymore","Perfect. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citigroup.","Chris Danely","Hey, thanks guys. I guess just a longer term question. I know you haven't commented on sort of the long term growth rate. Now that we're getting towards the end of the year here can you just talk about your kind of relative expectations for the growth in your end Markets and then any sort of operating margin or OpEx goals and then the plan to get those, thank you.","Jon Olson","So Chris, we aren't really giving prepared to give any real long term guidance or longer term guidance as Moshe mentioned a little earlier today but we clearly expect growth next year for us as the strength of our new products overall are going to drive us there. We seem to be in such a really strong position even at the latest generation of products of 60-nanometer products vis-\u00e0-vis competition.","We're getting very strong interest and demand interest from our customers for 20 and 60-nanometer products and as we mentioned in Moshe's remarks the uptake in terms of shipments of samples and early products has been extremely brisk to our customers which demonstrates a lot of interest and of course we are hopeful that it does turn into real significant revenue dollars downstream.","From a margin perspective we've been running kind of bouncing around a little bit between 68 to 70, but I'm still confident we're in the 68 to 70 range in any sort of near term plus or minus a few of the things that bumped us up to 70 and now down to 68.5 but I think we're solidly in the 68 to 70 range and we're going to provide more spending guidance at a later point.","We really haven't gone through our plan fully and gone through all of that entire exercise, so to summarize, I do believe in top line growth year on year for next year and stable margin.","Chris Danely","So, just a quickie. Will there be an Analyst Day or should we wait until the next quarterly announcement to get some fiscal 2017 guidance?","Jon Olson","Yeah, we'll give a little more guidance at the next earnings release and we are planning on doing, having an Analyst Day, but we haven't set a specific date for that yet.","Chris Danely","Okay. Thanks guys.","Moshe Gavrielov","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from CLSA Securities.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you. Moshe, you talked about wireless coming back a bit. I'm just curious how much visibility do you guys have into inventories at your customers and then what you saw last quarter and this quarter seems like more of an inventory normalization.","And if so how should we think about where we are in the inventory cycle? And then can you also talk about what you're seeing geographically in terms of any new rollouts or new developments in wireless?","Moshe Gavrielov","So the biggest rollout we're currently seeing is the SD rollout in China. We expect that to be significantly smaller than the TD rollout in terms of the length and the number of units but nonetheless we see that happening now and we believe that the improvement that we are seeing in our wireless business is driven by that.","We are waiting for continuing rollouts in India. We do believe that the level we had reached at the very bottom of our wireless cycle which happened in the June calendar 2014 is behind us and we're seeing growth beyond that but we don't see anything short-term which will enable us to reach the peak which I believe was in the March 2013 timeframe. I might have the year. It was, I'm sorry? 2014, the March 2014 timeframe.","So, we don't see anything which will bring us back to that anytime soon. We think that the 5G is the next big wave. We are being designed into all of the prototyping for demonstration of technology of 5G but that is not identical to being in the production vehicles which are likely to be very significant truthfully in the 2020 timeframe.","So, everything until 2020 is likely to be of a smaller scale and the next big surge will be driven by 5G. There will continue to be rollout of 4G on a worldwide basis but it's not going to be anything like the previous level so wireless is not going to reach that peak of March 2014 any time soon.","Srini Pajjuri","Okay. That's great. Thanks for that. And then Jon, again on the inventory front, I just asked about customer inventories but also if you can comment on your Balance Sheet inventories I think they came down and you also said they are going to come down again in March and given your optimism about growth for next year, I'm somewhat surprised that inventories are coming down if you could shed some light on that it will be helpful.","Jon Olson","Yeah, quite a few quarters ago we had built up our inventory intentionally for two reasons. One is we thought we saw some stronger demand and particularly in SD coming at us and we thought the foundry was pretty tight in terms of their ability to supply us and then we had six quarters of down revenue and so essentially what I'm saying is we built up too much inventory and we've been bleeding it off, so yes, we did go down quite a bit this quarter and we expect to go down again the next quarter, will be much closer to our desired model by the time we get to next quarter.","So, this is really getting us back to model which is more of the 90 to 100 day kind of range and that's the general target, of course that fluctuates depending on where we are on new product ramp capability, but this isn't, there shouldn't be viewed as some sort of a cautionary signal. This is really about getting inventory back into a historic model after we had built it up in about a year and a half ago.","Srini Pajjuri","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.","Harlan Sur","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Europe was down about 6% sequentially versus growth in all of your other geographies. Can you just help us understand what end markets in Europe were weak and how do you see Europe trending in the March quarter?","Jon Olson","So, generally, Europe I talked about automotive being down as being a customer timing issue, Automotive was certainly a driver that's where some of our largest Automotive customers are but I think in general, we've been looking at Wireless was down there in Europe as well as Industrial as part of that Industrial conversation I had previously, so I think we do expect Europe to bounce back some next quarter particularly with a much stronger Automotive revenue expected.","Harlan Sur","Great, thanks for that and then the team has done obviously a solid job on driving 20-nanometer and 20-nanometer new products. On the competitive front since your competitor has been in the midst of being acquired we've not really heard much in the way of their 14-nanometer program or product family.","You guys are obviously out there with your 16-nanometer products and getting good early traction. Is the Xilinx team seeing the 14-nanometer product set from your competitor and any competitive engagements?","Moshe Gavrielov","Harlan, we haven't seen them and we haven't seen any announcement from them. This sort of goes and contradicts the commitments that it's being made to share a long time ago so we think that this indicates the fact that we take out in June of last year, got silicon back in September, the silicon is very, very functional that we have a tremendous lead and we already have on the Virtex side which we expect to tape out","Sorry we expect to sample customers we've seen the silicon and again it is in great shape and what we're going to do is we're starting to turn the crank and it will be a large number of tape outs at 60-nanometer devises because we do believe we have at least a significant time to market leadership at this node. ","Jon Olson","Typically, what would happen, Moshe talked about tens of customers shipping the 16-nanometer product to UltraScale+, and typically what happens is there might be a bake off between us and our competitor, et cetera.","And at this point, we don't have any customer telling us there's a bake off going on, so that leads us to believe there are no parts out there but of course, we're not the center of all knowledge there but we haven't seen any as much.","Harlan Sur","Great. Thanks for the insights.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Rolland with FBR.","Chris Rolland","Hi guys thanks for the question. You guys mentioned a potential down tic in wired Coms next quarter. Perhaps you can elaborate on what you guys are seeing there and how you kind of view this market longer term?","Jon Olson","Yeah, we had quite a bit of growth this quarter in the wired communications area. It was both in I would say core wired communications as well as data center and particular both data acceleration but in a big way also some of the solid state storage and so that sometimes those customers buy a lot and then absorb and buy a lot and absorb and really the down is more related to the customer absorption and some of those cases than it is to any other trend.","What we are seeing is a very strong uptake of new products in wired communication so if you stripped out older products and just looked at the ramp of new products in 28-nanometer and newer you would see a very nice ramp in wired communications and growth next quarter in new products as well, so this is a kind of a timing issue more than it is a trend.","Chris Rolland","Okay. Great, thank you. And then not too much discussion on auto in the quarter, maybe that paused I don't know and then as we look at the ADAS market more specifically did you guys pick up any new guys there, Tier 1s, OEMs, I would love some color there.","And just for your ARM products more generally, auto and everything, what percentage of revenue would you say are actually associated with or have an ARM core in them? ","Jon Olson","So, there's quite a few questions in there.","Chris Rolland","Sorry.","Jon Olson","So, our overall automotive business continues to be very strong. Year-to-year full year growth in FY 2016 over 2015 at 30% that growth is coming primarily from ADAS applications. Our traditional business is around infotainment and its stable, still doing well.","Relative to the growth of new applications, I don't know that we have any new public something I can say publicly relative to new platforms but there were new design wins in the quarter in automotive that I'm just not at liberty to provide the name of the ultimate manufacturer at this point in time.","We are seeing designs we have one ramped very strongly and those again, the ADAS application being the biggest driver of growth there is a growing percentage of that ADAS that has an ARM core in it and in some cases we end up having in more simple applications just straight FPGAs in there but the ARM core is growing very dramatically.","So, if you'd say we talked last quarter about 50% of our revenue from automotive was ADAS related I would say at least half of that is associated with some level of ARM core and that will be growing over time.","Chris Rolland","Great. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Your next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wells Fargo.","David Wong","Thanks very much. In which applications are you seeing the most initial interest currently for 60-nanometer product? ","Jon Olson","Hi, David. Well there's quite a lot of them because it's a broad product offering, so there's the MPSoC which is basically the ARM based product and then there's the Kintex and the Virtex derivatives, so if you look at the ones which I think are the most significant ones at this point, it's the Next Generation ADAS, so this goes beyond the Zynq.","It's the industrial control and we do expect this to be used very broadly for 5G wireless at least for the prototyping versions whereas in the 20-20 time frame it's more likely to go into full-fledged production with 7-nanometer so those are three target markets which are driving the design wins in the 60-nanometer but reality is it's a very broad node so I'm probably doing a dissevers towards the others and I'm just sort of mentioning them.","David Wong","Great. Thanks.","Jon Olson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura.","Romit Shah","Yes, thank you. Moshe, you mentioned earlier partnerships with IBM on open power servers using their CPUs and as well, with Qualcomm using their server CPUs and I'm curious, how much interest are you guys seeing from web and cloud Service Providers to deploy these chips?","Moshe Gavrielov","We're seeing tremendous interest because as I said, this is an emerging market. This is a market where performance per Watt is one of the, is the most important parameter and our all programmable solutions can actually put a huge dent in improving that for a broad range of applications.","Now these tend to be at this point very large players who are very autonomous and control their software environment, so it's not a PC type environment where control is in the hands of the Microsoft, right? It's actually if you look at the big players, the Amazons, Googles, the Chinese equivalents, they absolutely control their environment and they are driven by the efficacy of their power footprint of their data center. That's why this is due to such an interesting and compelling opportunity going forward.","Now, there's a lot of excitement about this now, this is a market which is starting to evolve and it has several years to grow, so we've expected it to be significant five years from now and I just want to make sure that everyone understands that at least from our perspective. That's where it will start having the biggest impact. That doesn't mean there won't be deployments before that but in terms of being a significant portion of our revenue, then its five years away. ","Romit Shah","And is the partnership at Qualcomm exclusive or do you have the ability to partner with other ARM server suppliers?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, we have a very close relationship with Qualcomm but it's not an exclusive one on our behalf and fundamentally, we can connect with whoever is developing a solution whether it's x86, whether it's POWER-based or ARM based and we can help accelerate all of those and can rest assured that we're in the midst of working with all of them but the ones we have announced we have now a very deep relationship with and we're working towards enabling their products when they have the equivalent CPUs and Board systems for those environments but it's more than just the two that we have announced. ","Romit Shah","Okay. And then Jon, can I just ask quickly my impression is that revenue growths in June and September have traditionally been weaker than December and March and is that your impression as well and is there a seasonal component there?","Jon Olson","Yeah if you look back at our pattern, it has changed from time to time and last year I think that was we had down every quarter so it's hard to pick that pattern out of that but we aren't prepared to talk about the June quarter right now, we will have to wait until the next earnings release.","Romit Shah","Okay. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","Yes, thanks. Could you talk about scenarios to get gross margins back to the high end of the range, 70% is it the production ramp costs going away after March or does mix really need to turn more favorable here?","Jon Olson","Well, again our goal is to operate in 68-70 and we're comfortable with that so we don't have programs that are specific to have that target because we're obviously focused on adding the most value to the company and total on the operating margin dollar line but from a mix perspective, one of the bigger impacts that we had forecasted for this quarter was the fact that we knew we were going to be returning to a richer, large customer mix that tends to buy volume and therefore has better pricing as a result of that.","There's also some end market characteristics where we were at a low point for aerospace and defense and as that builds that will counteract some of the large customer impacts, so I guess if you're looking for a scenario that drives margin up, it is large customers except for aerospace and defense customers but again, we are trying to add total dollars to the bottom line. That's the goal.","Ian Ing","Okay. Thanks that's all I had.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank Ian. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann","Thank you. Hey, Moshe, just to go back on the aggressive ramp of new products this year. Is that a result of just faster than expected yield improvements at your foundry or are you being opportunistic to kind of take advantage of an opportunity versus the competition what exactly or is it just customer demand?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, it's basically driven by new technology and the maturity of the new technology and typically what happens when we start with the new process node then we tape out one version and then we go through an extensive debug cycle and once we have the debug done, then we can start turning the crank.","What has happened is the level of functionality was so high on the initial silicon that we actually could sample its customers and we could almost immediately start taping out the other versions.","And so the answer to your question is we're basically exploiting the high quality of the engineering execution and it behooves us to capitalize on that because as we tape out all of the other versions we expect to extend our market leadership in terms of breadth of product and in terms of having first mover advantage so it's that element which we're capitalizing on and it will manifest itself with tape outs, more tape outs having, happening faster than we had expected which is good news because there's more products out.","Hans Mosesmann","Great. Does that change, a follow-up does that change the timing of the tape out of 7-nanometer?","Moshe Gavrielov","No, it probably means that we will tape out more versions on 16 to exploit the maturity of it but it doesn't mean we'll do 7-nanometer earlier because in our industry the customers can only absorb the technology to a certain rate and we believe that on average every two and a half years to have a new node is the optimal time for their capacity to use the new technology and it also helps us contain our costs otherwise, we will just be burning money on tape outs ahead of when the customers can use it so we're still planning on 7-nanometer tape out in the 2017 calendar 2017 time frame generally speaking.","Hans Mosesmann","Okay. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon. You had said in past that 28-nanometer will be a larger node from a revenue standpoint than 20. Do you see expected that based on the response that you're seeing from customers and most of assuming that based on your 5G commentary 16 no matter revenues are expected to be lot where then the peak you expect at 28?","Jon Olson","Okay. So we absolutely expect 28-nanometer due to the richness of the product offering and the cost point that it's at and the customer needs to be a long lasting node and likely to be the largest node at least up to this point in the industry and we don't expect 16 or 20 to approach that.","We do expect the 16 and 20 together to be generally in that sort of size but the two together are not any one of them virtually and the 28-nanometer as I said had a record revenue this quarter. We expect it to have record revenue that was December.","We expect it to have another record revenue in the March quarter and we actually I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes our all-time highest record product in terms of quarterly revenue shipments sometime over the next 12 months and overtakes everything else in terms of that and what we're seeing is that we expect it to continue to grow albeit at a smaller rate over the next few years and it has several years until it actually hits its peak. So, that's the story on 28-nanometer for us. 16, we expect to be a very strong node too, but not as strong as 28.","Jon Olson","Not to confuse anything Moshe just said, but we are living in a multi-technology product family situation now. We just -- in the last couple of quarters, we've announced a Spartan 7 product line which is 28-nanometer technology and so we're extending -- using all of our technology to extend the low end and improve upon the low end of the FPGA market where 20 and 16-nanometer aren't as economical for us to go.","So, when you start looking at the growth of the company and the long-term situation is going to be a multi-node kind of product family rollout as we keep going in order to cover all of the different price points in the spaces we're going to be in.","Unidentified Analyst","Very useful. Thank you.","Jon Olson","Yes, thank you. Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Banc of America. ","Vivek Arya","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the good results and execution. My question, Moshe, is on the long term growth for the PLD industry. If I look over the last three, five or even 10 years, the topline growth for the industry has sort of been flattish despite a lot of penetration and new markets.","I understand the volatility in the Communications and the Aerospace market, but that's not going away any time soon and that's over half of the sales in this industry. So just the very basic fundamental question is what's going to be different over the next three, four year to create growth in this industry? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Well, -- I mean that's a profound question and I agree with your comments on it, we have been disappointed vis-\u00e0-vis growth over the past few years. I think -- and as a result there was a point in time where the general expectation was that you could deliver sustained double-digit growth and we're -- we believe that that is unlikely that it could happen, but it's unlikely to be the compound annual growth rate, so we're talking about single-digit growth even though we still need to deliver and as Jon indicated we do expect fiscal year 2017 to be a growth year.","On the general question which we'll try to answer probably a little better at our Analyst Day, the point I'd like to make is that except for high volume -- very high volume markets, ASICs and ASSPs and this is no longer a wet dream, right. This is documented known and happening and has happened over the past few years of becoming less and less viable.","And that opens a serviceable market and it requires the right silicon and it requires the right software and as we move forward and we continue to move forward with -- and being at the leading edge, there's less and less to compete with and if we have the right silicon and we have the right level of integration and we can enable a broader set of customers to use our technology, we should be able to benefit from that. That's sort of the very high level answer.","I'd like to give you a more profound answer but you know that isn't something we can do now. We will try to address it a little better during our Analyst Day and explain what we're doing in order to exploit the opportunities and among other things just a snip it is if you look at the ARM product line that enables us to service a market, which up to when it was available, we couldn't even touch, right and that the ASSP market and we've gone from to it already being approaching 20% of our revenue on the newest node, right. And that just sort of shows you that it's an expansion play. We'll try and give more example on explaining that in the future.","Vivek Arya","Very quickly, could you help, Moshe, help us quantify how large is your Data Center and your Automotive business today? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","I'll let Jon give you the official answer.","Vivek Arya","Okay.","Moshe Gavrielov","Or not give you.","Jon Olson","I actually don't have the Data Center information, so I don't -- we don't track that as a different sub on a routine basis and our Automotive business has been running in the 7% range, I'd say on -- if you look at it over a broad spectrum of quarters.","Vivek Arya","Got it. Thank you very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Yeah. And that's double where it was a few years ago, so it has grown.","Vivek Arya","All right.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blaine Curtis with Barclays.","Blaine Curtis","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. You talk about turning the crank on 16 and are you adding anymore products or is it just a pull-in in terms of the timing? And I know you aren't giving fiscal year 2017 guidance, but how does that impact to shape OpEx?","Moshe Gavrielov","We don't have the numbers, but obviously it's the right thing to do, right because we have leadership and there is market demand, it would be foolhardy not to exploit that and we will give you those numbers when we get giving the fiscal year 2017 number.","At this point, what we want to make is sure is that we exploit the breadth of the opportunity there and we're just accelerating the existing roadmap to provide it at an earlier point than we had expected before. There might be an option to actually also provide better coverage, but at this point, it's the former as opposed to the latter.","Blaine Curtis","Thanks. And then I just wanted to go back to a prior question on the Wireless segment. Is there a way to distinguish whether it's a recovery in inventory or are you actually seeing end market pick up? And then you talked about an average of 20% of revenue and not being able to get back to a prior peak, but average of 20, is that a good goal that this business could get back to as 20% of revenue?","Jon Olson","Well, I mean, I think that's a pretty reasonable play -- number, just plus or minus a reasonable error bar there. I think what Moshe was trying to communicate was that the very large build up in the overall 4G global network, we have passed that stage of the life cycle of 4G even though we continue to get a lot of long-tail business even from geographies that are [Indiscernible] deployed like North America for example, because of capacitation of the network adding on et cetera, and the situation and best as we can see it in China is they are building FD base stations, we've been told they are deployed, but as you know the last time we learned, we were told those kinds of thing that turns up they weren't all fully deployed and there were a lot of buildup in warehouses.","As best as we can tell it is moving through the manufacturing line and out of the warehouses and being deployed and it is going to be a couple of quarters of good business and yes there was some replenishment of inventory going on this quarter, but we also see growth next quarter in the Wireless business and some of that is related to the China market as well.","Blaine Curtis","Great. Thanks.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thanks Blaine. I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Moshe, Jon, thanks for sneaking me in. Two quick ones first is housekeeping. Jon now that the quarter is over, can you just level set us on what do you think the extra week added to both revenue and OpEx in the December quarter?","And then Moshe, I think this question might have been partially answered with Blaine's question, but when you think about getting Wireless back to prior peak, it sounds like that's more commentary on the overall CapEx cycle and inventory cycle and not the PLD opportunity set within base stations and I wonder if you could just comment a little bit on kind of what you think the content on PLD was supposed to be and how that's playing out through the 4G cycle?","Jon Olson","So relative to your first question on the impact, we had estimated a couple of a percent, 2% or 3% kind of in the last call and that's exactly where it turned out the last two weeks of the quarter were for us were 13, week 14 were quite muted on an individual basis and when you add those two together, it ends up being around a 2% or 3% kind of positive impact as a result of having that extra week. Of course, we get the spending -- and we have all of the extra spending as well in that quarter.","And then your second question was around the peak, Moshe, do you want to answer?","Moshe Gavrielov","Yes, so what we see is a continuing opportunity and actually a growing opportunity for FPGA content in Wireless, we're seeing number of players who can effectively design ASICS, which is the other option because there really isn't a viable ASSP solution at this point in time and we don't see that happening any time soon, so it's ASICs versus FPGAs.","We're seeing less and less players with the capacity to do that and so the role of FPGAs grows and with each generation generally speaking, the average ASP per system is a little higher. It doesn't reflect the much larger role of the FPGA has in the system, so it's an integration play. We replace a lot of other components and so we have more major parts, but the ASP does not go out at the same level to reflect the value the FPGA provides.","But generally speaking, it's one of those markets where the role of the FPGA continues to grow and major competition is the very, very, very few and actually diminished number of players who can design ASIC alternatives and that number continues with each generation of product to go lower and lower.","John Pitzer","Perfect. Thank you. ","Moshe Gavrielov","Hey. Thank you, John.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 P.M. Pacific Time, 8:00 P.M. Eastern Time today.

Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Rick. Fiscal year 2016 was another profitable year for Xilinx although revenue did not meet our expectations going into the year. Revenue was $2.2 billion for the year, down 7% from last year but strengthening throughout FY 2016. Gross margin remained strong through the year, averaging 69.7% as our pricing and cost management efforts continued to have a positive impact. Operating margin exceeded 30% based on these margin management efforts and prudent spending.","Cash flow margin was 33%, the same as last year. So our lower revenues contributed to a lower operating cash flow of $730 million. We repurchased 9.7 million shares for $443 million and paid $319 million in dividends, a total return of $761 million. This is the second straight year we have returned over 100% of cash flow and 11th straight year of dividend increase.","Turning now to a discussion of the fourth quarter. Xilinx sales were $571 million, up 1% as new products continued to grow and we saw stabilizing trends across our end market segments. Communications was flat with a small growth in wireless offsetting a small decline in wired. Industrial and A&D was down slightly with strength in aerospace and defense offsetting declines in industrial, and test and measurement. Broadcast, consumer and automotive grew 6% powered by another record quarter in automotive, demonstrating our strength in ADAS.","Gross margin in Q4 was 69.2%, higher than last quarter and higher than expected due to the mix of customers and products in addition to lower product ramp expenses. We continued to aggressively manage both the pricing and cost sides of gross margin. Operating expense at $217 million was slightly lower than our guidance. A reminder here that a significant part of the decline from Q3 was due to the 14th week in our Q3. The increase in revenue, gross margin, and lower operating expense drove an increase of more than 10% in operating income for the quarter, up to $178 million. Other income and expense was an expense of $8 million, higher than forecasted due to an equity investment write-off. The tax rate was 14.6% for the quarter.","Our net income for Q4 was $146 million or $0.54 per share. Operating cash flow was $127 million, down from last quarter, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were 268 million shares including 10.5 million shares from the convertible. During the quarter, we repurchased 3 million shares for $143 million and we paid $80 million in dividends.","Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $3.6 billion in gross cash and $2 billion in net cash after our debt. As mentioned above, we saw an increase in accounts receivable to $307 million. This was entirely due to the timing of customer shipments in the quarter, and we see no credit or collectability issues. Inventory was $179 million, down from $17 million from the prior quarter and down $52 million from the beginning of the year as we continue to manage inventory down.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jon. I am very pleased with both the financial and operating results of the fourth quarter. Our revenue has rebounded to its highest level in over a year, while expanding the growth momentum which started in the fiscal third quarter. As Jon discussed, both profitability and cash flow remained robust throughout the entire year, reflecting our strong business model. Our execution on the 28, 20, and 16-nanometer nodes has been exceptional. The realignment driven in our sales organization is leading to stronger customer relationships and expanding our reach. We are confident this will translate into revenue growth from both market share gains and market expansion. Following are some achievements, which illustrate the strength of our position.","Our technology and product leadership has translated to 4 points of PLD market share gains over the past five years. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we delivered record sales on the 28-nanometer node and expect to set a significant new record in the June quarter. Our 20-nanometer family approached $100 million in revenue in fiscal year 2016, while significantly exceeding our targets in all four quarters of fiscal year 2016. We expect to ship well over $30 million of 20-nanometer product in the June quarter.","In a successful demonstration of our market expansion efforts, revenue from our Zynq product line more than doubled in fiscal year 2016. Zynq is particularly strong in the automotive, wireless and industrial markets. For example, our automotive business has grown over 60% over the past two years driven by deployment of advanced driver assistance applications in over 60 automobile models. At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all three UltraScale+ product families ahead of schedule and have already shipped six unique products to several tens of customers.","Our one year plus leadership in 16-nanometer products has generated multi $100 million design wins on customer platforms, which in the past have traditionally been ASSP based. We have established data center partnerships targeting data center acceleration initiatives with both IBM and Qualcomm and are deeply engaged with multiple hyperscale data center customers. Lastly, we completed the rollout of the SDx family of software-defined development environments. This is a key capability to significantly expanding our user base beyond traditional PLD designers to a much larger community of systems and software engineers.","We finished fiscal year 2016 with undisputed product leadership on the silicon, software and IP fronts, very well positioned in multiple markets coupled with much deeper engagements with key customers and partners. Our excellent execution could not have come at a more opportune time. The consolidation in the semiconductor industry is leading to rationalization and elimination of competing product lines at both traditional ASIC and ASSP companies. This phenomenon has opened up new growth opportunities for Xilinx as the vendor of choice with our existing and new customers. This is a carpe diem opportunity. The time is ripe for us to capitalize on the three successive generations of leadership to expand our market position. We intend to do this by simultaneously pursuing on the following four fronts.","On the 16-nanometer UltraScale+ front, due to its excellent software and pristine silicon functionality, we have elected to both accelerate our currently planned 16-nanometer tape-outs and expand the original product portfolio. These multimarket 16-nanometer products complement our successful 20-nanometer family with its estimated 80% market share. They address near-term revenue growth opportunities in the data center market tailored for the first wave of 5G deployments in the 2018 timeframe, while positioning us for longer-term massive 5G deployment. After that, serve the automotive market and form the basis for expanding our platform wins in the Industrial Internet of Things.","Similarly, we are executing on our plans to deliver our 7-nanometer product offerings. This capitalizes on our extremely tight relationship with our absolutely outstanding foundry partner TSMC to satisfy the advanced technology needs of our leading-edge customers. This is another pillar of our SAM expansion strategy. In parallel, we are committed to providing our customers with an attractive high volume spot in 7-nanometer family. This family will be implemented in 20-nanometers and will expand our market position in the price-sensitive parts of the market.","On the software front, we will enable market expansion by a breakout in integration and programming models targeted to high growth segments driven by cloud computing, vision processing, including, but not limited to ADAS, the Industrial Internet of Things and 5G. Our plans for fiscal year 2017 while aggressive are based on the financial principles we have consistently demonstrated. We're committed to continuing to invest prudently to preserve and extend our market position, while delivering longer term a 30%-plus operating margin and preserving our commitment to return cash to our shareholders.","Before I turn the call over to Lorenzo who will discuss the financial guidance of Q1 and the rest of fiscal year 2017, I would like to use this opportunity to personally thank Jon for his 11 years of extremely significant contributions and exemplary partnering at the helm of Xilinx. Lorenzo, you have big shoes to fill.","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Thank you, Moshe, and I also would like to thank Jon specifically for the leadership function over the past 11 years. Moshe has established the compelling opportunity for Xilinx, and now I want to provide you all with the financial guidance aligned to our taking advantage of that opportunity. Starting with Q1, revenue will be approximately flat. We entered the quarter with backlog down slightly and are expecting turns to be about 49%. We expect new products to continue to grow with 28-nanometer growing to a new record, and 20-nanometer exceeding $30 million. With respect to end markets, communications and data center growth will offset a decline in industrial and A&D. Communications and data center growth reflects a continued ramp of our customers' wired designs and a near-term firming in wireless. The decline in industrial and A&D is primarily due to program timing in A&D. Broadcast, automotive, and consumer will be down slightly reflecting a small inventory cycle in automotive and a small decline in broadcast.","Our gross margin will be between 69% and 70%, and our operating expense will be approximately $220 million including $1 million of amortization. Other income and expense will be an expense of $5 million and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be 266 million. As we move into the discussion of our full year guidance, I want to remind the audience that we have our analyst day on the May 23 in Boston. While I expect there will be questions on the full year guidance, we will give further details at our analyst day.","First on revenue, we see annual revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 8%. This will be driven by growth in communications and data center and broadcast, consumer and automotive and to a lesser degree by industrial and A&D. Within communications and data center, all end markets will show growth including wireless, as it has recovered from the low points in FY 2016.","In broadcast, consumer, and automotive, we expect automotive to continue to grow strongly, although at a reduced rate with the other end markets showing some growth. In industrial and A&D, the overall growth of the segment will be mitigated by program timing factors in A&D, although the underlying business in A&D remains healthy. We see the growth of our overall business weighted into the second half of the fiscal year. For gross margin, we expect to remain in the range of 68% to 70%. Our price and cost management efforts will continue to support our gross margin, though we expect some pressure from product ramp expenses and customer mix through the year.","For the past few years, we have been deliberately increasing our relative emphasis on R&D, while extracting efficiency from SG&A. This has provided the resourcing for the execution we have seen on 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and now 16-nanometer, and has put us in the advantageous position Moshe has described. We are continuing that approach with an investment level and focus consistent with addressing the opportunity we see in front of us. In order to capitalize on and extend our market position, operating expense is expected to grow 7% to 9% with almost all of the growth being in research and development. This growth funds the expansion of our leadership position with the 28-nanometer Spartan-7, significant increases in tape-out expenses to accelerate our lead in 16-nanometer, and our leading 7-nanometer product development.","Other income and expense will decline slightly through the year from the $5 million quarter level in the first quarter. This will mean that we will see approximately half the expense we saw in fiscal year 2016, a significant improvement driven by last year's interest rate increases and a small anticipated increase in interest rates in FY 2017. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%. With the growth in revenue and the operating assumptions I've described, we anticipate low single digit growth in earnings per share in fiscal year 2017.","Let me now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Our first question comes from Romit Shah from Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Oh, hi. Thank you. It's the first time I'm hearing about some softness in automotive. I think you guys made the comment for fiscal 2017 that it would grow, but perhaps a little bit more slowly. So could you give us some more color on what's happening with your automotive business?","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Sure. I'm not exactly sure I relate to the softness characterization. I think what we're reflecting is the rate of growth in the past couple of years has been very significant, although the rate of growth in FY 2017 will also be significant, it just won't be at that same rate.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","You mentioned in your prepared remarks that there was some inventories in automotive, I wasn't sure specifically where that might be.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Romit. This is Jon. I'm not exactly sure where you heard that. What we're trying to characterize is that the automotive segment for us is growing quite significantly and has been and is going to continue. We are experiencing in the industrial side a period of slower growth than we had anticipated, just because of some macroeconomic areas, but definitely no inventory issues with respect to automotive.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Maybe I just misunderstood, Jon. And the other question I had was on 7-nanometer, can you give us a sense on when you think you'll be ramping 7-nanometer and in particular, what does that sort of mean for your opportunity in data centers?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me take a cut at that. So, data center is a fast-emerging market, and it's still in the nascent period, so it's a market which we expect over the next five years to grow at a rapid rate. For us, it could be significant and in that sort of timeframe as we execute, we believe that it could be a multi $100 million market, which for us is a big number. We can service it and we are servicing it already with our existing product portfolio, so we actually have design wins in 20-nanometer, 16-nanometer, and I'm pretty sure we would expect to have significant design wins in 7-nanometer too.","What you will get from 7-nanometer is typically higher level integration, higher performance, lower power, all of these things are important to this market where every two years to three years, there's a total refresh of the data centers due to the rapid rate of evolvement. So data center is a big driver of our 7-nanometer business, but actually part of the expansion of our 16-nanometer we expect to have significant benefits, that's targeted at data center too. So, you don't need to wait until 7-nanometer in order to see our revenue growth in data center, it should come ahead of that.","Given the nature of our business, after we tape out the device, it typically takes a year to move into production, and then the deployment is very market-specific. So, there are markets that deploy very quickly. Emulation is an example of the one which deploys fastest, but data center is also a fast time to market for us, so probably 7-nanometer, our data center product, should be generating revenue, 2019-2020, that sort of timeframe. All right, hopefully that answers your question.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","It does. Thanks, Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Stein from SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'm hoping you might be able to help us understand what looks like a bit of a lower than expected outlook in the industrial, aero and defense. It sounds like it's more aerospace and defense linked both for the June quarter and the full year. And I guess I'm a little perplexed because my expectation was that that end market was improving this year owing to DoD budgets and the like. Maybe it's more commercial aerospace that you're exposed to. Any clarification there could really help, in particular both for the quarter and for the full year.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, This is Jon. Let me take that one. So I think, Will, you're familiar with the fact that we characterized we had a roll-off of a very large program and we bottomed out, I think, in our June quarter of this past year for aerospace and defense. And we have had incremental improvement in each quarter from that point. Actually, bottomed out in September, excuse me, in the September quarter, not the June quarter. We've had incremental improvement in every quarter and we do expect that incremental improvement to continue in aerospace and defense. It's just that when you look at the full year, we still ship quite a bit of product in our first quarter of last year that is dragging the year-on-year comparison down, so it's a modest growth in aerospace and defense.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is actually a very stable, strong comeback for us, and when the redesign of the F35 capability starts kicking in more towards the end of the next fiscal year, I think you're going to see some acceleration there. Industrial has been more bit of a timing issue for us with certain customers, A, and then some recent softness particularly in the APAC that we're seeing softness in industrial and in a couple of our regions, and that's going to grow a little more slowly than we thought, but we still are expecting pretty significant growth on a year-on-year basis.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's helpful.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'm sorry.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Was going to add something.","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Yeah, I was just, you know, the FY 2017 A&D business is, I would characterize as there's a very broad base of projects underneath it extending from electronic warfare to munitions to data analysis and communication systems. And it's different from when we had the very large GSF program as Jon described. So, I think I would characterize it as a very strong and diverse market in A&D. But it is coming off of the cycle that Jon described.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's helpful. Maybe if I can ask for a brief update on the broadcast end market. I know it's relatively small, but it's one of these sub-industries in your end-market categorization that tends to move around a lot. I'm wondering what the trends are there.","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Well, there's two parts to that, the way I think about it. One is the cameras and then the other part is a distribution aspect of things. And the distribution aspect is moving more towards server and common platforms, and in some cases we're actually seeing some of that start to bleed into what we would call our classic communications business as IP protocols are used more. Camera business has tended to be more around trends of the technology, so thinking of the move to 4K and then 8K beyond that. So we are seeing relative strength in the whole camera side of it, because of those trends more towards 4K in terms of recording content and things like that. The other side of the distribution we're seeing relative softness.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you. I had a question on the OpEx. You guys have done a very good job the last couple years being very disciplined on the OpEx side. What are you seeing that OpEx is going up so much this year?","And then I had a longer-term architectural question for you, Moshe, if you could please address that. There's a lot of conversation around accelerating compute in the data center. And so if you could please provide us your perspective on where do FPGAs sit. If we look at the different kinds of workloads and what's the trade off in power versus performance, and specifically, does the fact that Intel is able to put FPGA and a server chip on a single, either on a package or a single die. Does that create moats or disadvantages for your solution? I noticed you had another announcement at the POWER Summit. Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Okay, Ambrish. So thanks for the first question, I wanted to make sure that I clarify. What we believe is we now have almost a once in a lifetime opportunity, and this is driven by two things. One is outstanding execution and I'm not going to keep beating that dead horse. I think I can assume that the issue of credibility on that topic is no longer in question. I hope so.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No, it's not.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Not for me at least, Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. It has been in the past, and I think now with three generations of leadership, allow me to feel vindicated on that topic. So when you've delivered on that and you see the massive changes which are happening in the market, and no way am I minimizing the challenges of competing with very large corporations like Intel, like the new Broadcom, et cetera. But in reality what is happening is, the semiconductor market has matured, is changing radically, and it's changing in a way where a lot of applications which in the past could justify an ASIC or there would be a small and medium-sized ASSP company that would provide a complete solution. Neither the ASICs are particularly viable and most of those little companies and medium size companies have gone. They've disappeared and some have merged, some just are no longer viable. But in reality, a lot of those product lines do not have a path going forward.","And this is a multimarket trend, right? So I wouldn't say that it's true in every single market, but it's true in a lot of the markets that we service that we actually now are finding that we have the \u2013 it's a much larger TAM we can address through our product offering, because our product offerings have evolved and with the Zynq product line and the like and the integrated capabilities, we can provide an alternative to ASSPs. And so both through our technology, through our market leadership and through the fact that the consolidation largely is eliminating solutions for a lot of these markets, which might not be multi-billion dollar markets, but they're nice markets for us, we are the best game in town, and the customers are telling us that.","So I'm sitting in front of this great opportunity saying, okay, we have the technology leadership, and these opportunities are coming up. Do I take my foot off the gas? Do I keep my foot on the gas but where it was? Or do I push the pedal all the way down to the metal? And this was a strategic discussion we had, and we figured out that we can still remain at 30% plus operating margin and grow to that point in and around and over time grow a bit there, and we'll talk a little more about that in May. But we're at the high end of profitability, so we might as well exploit this. And in a nutshell, this is an opportunity, and we think it would be foolhardy not to pursue it. And as I said, we can do this while retaining a fabulous return of cash to investors with almost best-in-class operating margin, we can still do all of that.","So, yes, that's the message we try to deliver and we will provide a little more clarity on that, and that's why you're seeing the investment grow, and it's almost all in R&D because we have to do more tape-outs and we have to develop a few more things in parallel. So one way of doing it, of encapsulating this, and this could be viewed as being arrogant, we're doing it because we can. The other way of looking at it is we're doing it because we can't afford not to exploit this great opportunity, right? And that's the thinking behind this. So, hopefully, again that clarifies the strategic question.","On the architectural issue and data centers, so again, this is an evolving market, which is nascent at this point in time, and it's a market which traditionally has been serviced by CPUs. And over the past several years, NVIDIA in particular has identified that there are segments that are well serviced by GPUs and they actually have established a strong foothold in the market.","What has become very clear and there's a lot of papers from third parties, there's one from Microsoft which analyze what happens with these massively parallel applications and how well they do if instead of just using a CPU or a GPU, you actually use an FPGA or programmable logic. And what they found is that for a lot of very critical applications, there's anywhere between potentially a 10x to 35x improvement in performance per watt if you use programmable logic. And that's the essence. That market is evolving. It's a market which is unique because most of it, at this point in time, is controlled by very large independent companies that actually control the ecosystem for this.","So it doesn't require a Microsoft with all of the x86 applications. It can be thought of as an embedded application, which is controlled by these very large companies. And these very large companies are looking for alternatives to Intel and alternatives to GPUs, and this was cited by Intel justifiably as one of the reasons that they acquired Altera and paid what they did for Altera. It was worth that much for them.","Going forward, we expect the market to bifurcate into an Intel x86 camp and everyone else, with everyone else regardless of their x86 or power-based or ARM-based, and for most of these other players this is a significant growth market, then we are realistically the only game in town. Hence, we believe that that's very profitable for us. On the Intel x86 side, we do believe that Intel will do all sorts of integration things. Regardless of that, as we talk to these hyperscale customers, they're indicating to us that for a lot of their requirements, actually a non-integrated solution which they totally control is more attractive than one which is dictated to them from above.","And so we're investing heavily. We think we have a big lead on the technology side, and we do expect this to be a multi-hundred-million-dollar opportunity, but again this is in a five-year timeframe. We have design wins, we have several of them. They are going to go into production soon, and this is both likely in North America and outside North America. But it's still early days. And again, being a multimarket company, we believe that this will be a significant growth opportunity for us. So I apologize for the verbose answer, but there's a lot to cover on both...","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","No, I appreciate it, Moshe. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thank you. More questions on these investment levels for the fiscal year. I know you talked about it being a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and customers are saying you're the best game in town. But how many years are you willing to grow investments faster than revenue? Do we have to wait until 16-nanometer materializes to get the benefits, or should 20-nanometer help reverse the trend at some point? I mean, is 30% op margin the line in the sand here? Thanks.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. That's a great question and I think we will answer it in more detail in May. But just to sort of give you a preview, we're going to be approaching that either way, and we intend to grow the company over time to beat that number and to grow beyond it. So we'll give a little more clarity as to when you can expect that in May, but you're not going to need to wait several years for that.","Now this year is particularly significant in terms of growth, because to be totally open, we have so overachieved on the functionality of the 16-nanometer that we are just accelerating the tape-outs, and each of these tape-outs is a multimillion dollar cost to us. So knowing realistically, we're sort of pulling several of them in, which is good news because that means that over time it should translate to revenue quickly. But what you're seeing now, this rate of growth in R&D, which potentially could be larger than the top line, we do not expect that to continue in the future. And again, in May we'll give you more.","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Yes, Ian, it's Lorenzo here. I think we are really, really conscious of the strength of our operating model, and I want to point out again what was said earlier, we've been very disciplined at how we've spent and invested our money in the past. I think this is a strategic investment area, and as Moshe said, our objective is to get back to our target operating margin levels as quickly as possible.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks. And, Jon, congrats on your retirement. Hopefully you attend a lot of Green Bay Packer games this season.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Ian.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not more than 16.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Ji (39:26) for Ross Seymore. Thank you for letting me ask a question. So, Moshe, what gives the company confidence in spending so much more in OpEx that the OpEx spend will yield revenues given the past few years where revenue growth has been difficult to generate?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. That's a great question. What sort of has happened over the past few years is we're in a business where most of the markets we serve take a long time to come to fruition. And so if you look at 28 nanometer, which we taped out six years ago, it is now approaching $200 million a quarter. It hasn't quite reached that level. $200 million a quarter is, give or take, only a third, in and around it's about 30% of our overall revenue.","So what you're seeing is the time it takes for the new nodes starting from 28 nanometers and now at 20 nanometers, which as we said we shipped close to a 100 million relatively quickly for us during the past fiscal year. They're in their continued growth phase, and also the Zynq product line is now in its more accelerated growth phase. For example, automotive is driven by the Zynq product line, which is an expansion play.","And so we're at the point in time where all of the headwinds we had, which are all technologies, some execution challenges we have had in the past which we are paying the price for, et cetera, they're tailing off. And the new technologies where we have much higher market share and where the expansion plays are starting to pick up, and so I think your question is very fair and a very good one, but the reason is that we now see that the headwinds are tailing off and, hence, the growth from the new products will happen. And we're also seeing the changes in the industry.","For example, I'll just throw one thing at you. Five years ago we predicted that the Japanese ASICs vendors would depart the stage, right. And at the time, that was considered a heresy, right, because they had owned the market for the longest period of time. And to a large extent they're gone, right. So that's an opportunity for us. A lot of the other ASIC vendors have gone. I mean it's not that there are no ASIC companies, but there are fewer and fewer of them. The same thing is true on the ASSP side. So the serviceable market is now growing, and in order to exploit that, we're making these larger investments.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then as a follow up, is the OpEx expected to be back-half weighted in the fiscal year similar to revenues, so it can be moderated if revenues don't follow?","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","The second half operating expense will be significantly higher than the first half. But you'll start seeing the increase in the second quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Okay, thanks. And we echo congratulations to Jon.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I said the first thank you.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay, all right, Moshe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. Hey, Moshe, on the going back to the 16-nanometer and the decision to accelerate and expand on the tape-outs and such. How much of it is a result of a competitive dynamic? I understand the customers are eager, but perhaps there's another element here. Your competitor might be delayed or delayed significantly. How much of it is that potentially that you're taking advantage of an opening, if you will? Thanks.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Clearly we believe we have a year lead, potentially a more significant lead than that, and it behooves us to exploit it. And because our silicon is in such good shape and we can do multiple tape-outs and we're already shipping six products, which for us would be unheard of. This is a product we taped out at the very end of June. So it's only nine months since we taped it out and we already are shipping six derivative unique products. So that means that we've done six tape-outs, which means that it's really in very good shape. And you're right that if we sit back and we have a very worthy competitor and we just let them, don't exploit that, we're likely to compromise the potential here.","So, yeah, there is an element of that. That's on our core programmable logic business. But this goes beyond programmable logic because with 16-nanometer and with 7 and with Zynq, we can provide an alternative to ASICs and ASSPs and those are our nontraditional competitors. And obviously we just need to keep running as quickly as we can to maintain the lead we have in terms of technology, so it's both.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Fair enough. And then a quick follow-up, please. On the Zynq side, on the automotive business, what's the competitive dynamic there? Are you gaining share? What's the size of the market? If you can just give us a little framework there as you look into fiscal 2017. Thanks.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Hans, this is Jon. Let me take that one. So, we talk a lot about ADAS, and I think we get a lot of comparisons to what we're doing in the forward-looking cameras which is where we have a lot of strength, particularly in the stereo versions of those. But our ADAS business is really very broad. So Zynq is a driver of it, and it's a driver of us not just in the forward-looking cameras, but also in some of the other safety and lane departure and those kinds of things as well.","We have developed a really broad business in the automotive world, and it isn't just one competitor. There's a variety of competitors now that we're meeting. And when we talk about, when you see the presentations in May, I think you're going to see a lot more conversation around the breadth of what we have and why we're so confident about successive years of growth in this market. So in other words, FPGA technology is not just the programmable processing unit. It's really broader than that for us, and we're doing really quite well.","Hans C. Mosesmann - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you. Very helpful.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. You've talked about 5G starting to ramp in 2018. How should we look at the wireless infrastructure market between now and then? What's the status of the 4G ramping in Europe, and how should we look at wireless infrastructure trends over the next couple of quarters given kind of the turmoil that we saw in China last year?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'll give you my cut, and then I'm sure there's a lot of additional information Jon and Lorenzo can add. But we hit the low point in the June quarter of calendar 2015. And that was a really low, low point. So if you do peak-to-trough, it was almost one-half of the peak or maybe even less than one-half of the peak. And what we have seen is it's recovering. We think there's a lot of things that happened because wireless is a multi-geography, multi-generation phenomenon on the infrastructure side. What we saw was there was the combination of all of the bad news on all of the fronts happened at the same time for us. Since then, it has improved.","We're seeing renewed deployment in China. We're seeing deployment in India, and this is all triggered around, this is not 5G. This is largely LTE. We think that LTE still has a lot of deployment left. And that will probably, for the next few years, continue to carry things. What we're seeing which is very encouraging to us is if you go back a year or a year-and-half ago, the general feeling was that there would be no rush towards 5G. And that has sort of totally changed within the past year. And there now seems to be a race towards 5G with an amazing amount of prototyping and proof-of-concept being done now. And we actually have a great footprint there.","We expect a quasi-5G or an early 5G to be deployed in 2018 at a minimum in Korea, but actually I won't be surprised if there's some early signs in North America. And then 2020 onward, we expect it to grow. It's expected to be a very large market, and there's a lot of applications which are driving it. Smartphones, even though they're not growing, their footprint in terms of bandwidth is increasing, right? So maybe there's not that many new smartphones, but the refresh cycle is for ones which require more bandwidth and significantly bigger load on the infrastructure. And the applications are driving that and, the other one is the Internet of Things both on the consumer and the industrial side, and that's expected to generate totally new set of needs for infrastructure. So we think it's a big market. Again, we'll shed some more light on that in May with people who are more expert in the field.","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Yeah, I think despite Moshe's saying, Jon and I could have a lot to add, his answer was \u2013 it was fairly comprehensive. In the near term what we see is, as Moshe described, firming up the recovery from where we had been in the low points particularly in China, backfills geographically around the world, and ramp in India although we don't expect that to be of the same magnitude as China. And then finally, the 5G prototyping pre-production type of business is actually pretty good business for us this year.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's very useful. And then a quick follow-up question. What opportunities do you see in small cell? I mean, we've learned obviously that the price points were high and have kind of delayed what people thought was a ramp starting a few years ago, but it looks like we're now starting to see signs in China notably. Do you expect to participate, or is that type of market naturally gravitating toward ASIC given the high volumes?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So that trend is continuing but certainly not as robust as people had indicated a number of years ago that it was going to be deployed. We are participating in small cells. It is still a market that we can be in if we're talking about urban areas where there \u2013 where the number of users and densification requirement, so I would say not on the home or local kinds of things, but in urban areas where they're trying to augment macro base stations, we are playing in those, particularly in the radios. So, yeah, but we don't see it as a big offset to the long-term macro station.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. First, I just want to thank Jon for all the help over the years, I really appreciate it. Moshe, I know on an earlier question you kind of addressed that the OpEx guidance for the fiscal year 2017 is pretty back-half loaded. I guess I just want some clarification, how dependent is that OpEx number in kind of hitting the revenue guidance number you gave? If for some reason revenue were to come a little bit short, would that OpEx number have some modulation in it, or is a lot of that just kind of fixed OpEx based upon projects that you are planning on doing in the back half of the fiscal year?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, let's say there's a huge downturn and we're rational people, and we behave accordingly. Right? So we generally realize that we have a responsibility here, and we take it very seriously. So if that happens, we will act accordingly. Lorenzo's guidance for the year is 4% to 8%, and we're not planning on some huge surge to justify this. We're planning on a gradual growth during the year. We think that's very reasonable given our strong design win situation, and the fact that we do see them moving into production now at a greater rate on the newer nodes. So I'm not discounting that. Things happen. And if they do, we will act accordingly.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful, Moshe. And then my guess is you'll address this in a lot more detail at the analyst day, and I'm not a huge fan of looking at seasonality because there's so much variance around seasonality. But if I just pivot seasonally off your June guidance, I'm getting fiscal revenue year growth in 2017 that's more flattish versus kind of the 6% midpoint guidance you gave. I'm just kind of curious, can you give us some broad strokes as to what end markets or what product portfolios you think are going to start driving sort of better than seasonal growth as you go throughout the year?","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","So let me take that, because I've actually looked at the issue of seasonality. I think the complexity of our business and the multi-market nature of our business makes seasonality a tough model to apply because we're more prone to be following longer term growth or decline trends than we are necessarily seasonal behaviors like, say, a retailer. And I know you acknowledged that up-front, John, but I think what we're really saying in this market environment, it is the continued growth of our new products which you can view as not being terribly impacted by seasonality.","And the expansion into new markets which are also not impacted by seasonality that are driving our overall growth for the year. And those would be the continued ramp of new products in our wired business, and I've made in my commentary, there's relative firmness in Wireless. Expansion in the Data Center, continued growth in the expansion opportunities we've developed in automotive. Those are the things that are going to drive us. And like I said, I don't see that kind of expansion impacted significantly by seasonality.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Helpful. Thanks, guys.","Jon A. Olson - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you. Operator, we can take one more question.","Operator","Our last question then comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Christopher Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just had a longer term question about the direction of the auto business and architectures there. I mean, the systems today are kind of a hodgepodge of ASICs and FPGAs, each controlling different functions and you've seen some players lay out a vision that involved more of a centralized control as the market matured. You clearly have long-term engagements with customers. I guess what is the interest you're seeing? Are you still seeing, you know, them desiring discrete chips to drive each of these functions? Or are you seeing an interest in more of a centralized controller?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we'll give some more depth here, but again this is an emerging set of applications, and there is various ways of skinning the cat. We do think that it won't all end up with one centralized monster processor regardless. Now, there may be more done centrally, or there may be less done centrally, but it won't all be done centrally for a whole host of reasons. In order to enable this distribution, one of the biggest issues is of course the issue of security. And that's where our products, because the security can be built in our products, and embedded in hardware as opposed to software which can more easily be hacked and manipulated. We believe that we have a strong potential advantage as that turns out to be the case. Right?","But I think this is going to evolve over 10 years, 15 years, right? And this is a long-term transition. And regardless, I don't think that even at the very end it will all be in one place. I think, there will be lots of reasons for it to be distributed over. But for sure for the next two generations of products we don't see anything other than distributed solution.","Lorenzo Flores - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Yeah, I think the whole issue with latency and you can't wait for a decision to be made by a processor unit to get information to the driver at essentially real-time speeds. And that's where we excel. And there will be many of those applications that are so critical to getting that information there, that you cannot stand any sort of a latency kind of an issue. And that's where we're finding huge interest even in our more advanced products from customers.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Very helpful.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx investor relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $604 million during the quarter and profitability at $0.62 per share was significantly higher than expected. Sales for Q2 fiscal 2015 were down 1% sequentially and in line with our guidance.","All primary end-markets performed as we expected. With respect to the sub-end-markets, aerospace and defense, industrial, scientific and medical, test and measurement, automotive, and data center, all increased while all other secondary end-markets decreased.","28-nanometer sales were flat and 40-nanometer sales declined as anticipated, reflecting an overall decline in our new products category. Our base category, which is comprised of our oldest products, increased significantly during the quarter, driven primarily by the timing of programs in the aerospace and defense end-market that we discussed with you last quarter. On a year-on-year basis, new products were up 21%, mainstream down 8%, and base products down 14%.","Sales to communications customers were down significantly as expected, with two customers accounting for the majority of the decline. Both wired and wireless communications were down double digits sequentially, while data center sales increased. Turns were 48% for the quarter. Gross margin at 71.9% was a record for the company and better than expected, due to product and customer mix. Operating expenses were slightly better than expected at $235 million, including amortization of $2.4 million. This resulted in operating income of $200 million, up 22% from the same quarter a year ago.","Other income and expense was a net expense of $6 million, slightly better than forecasted, mainly due to higher interest income on our investment portfolio. Net income for the quarter was $172 million or $0.62 per diluted share. A number of factors contributed to the high level of profitability including a higher gross margin percentage than forecasted, a tax credit for approximately $2 million utilized during the quarter, and a lower number of shares outstanding.","Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $204 million before $8 million in CapEx. Diluted shares for the quarter were $267 million. This was $6 million less than forecasted due to the increased buyback activity during the quarter and the impact of the lower stock price. There was a 6.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note.","We continue to be committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter we stepped up our buyback activity, repurchasing 4.8 million shares for $200 million. We also paid $77 million in quarterly dividends. For the first half of the fiscal year, we returned over $450 million to shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends, significantly more than we generated in operating cash flow.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $49 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed-rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.","Inventory increased slightly during the quarter. The vast majority of our inventory is in new products for which we continue to have strong forecasted end-demand. As we discussed last quarter, our plans are to reduce inventory dollars by the end of the fiscal year.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal 2015. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting significant sequential growth from our 28-nanometer product family. We expect both wired and wireless communications to increase modestly.","China wireless deployments continue to be gated by the availability of components essential to the ramp of FPGAs. We remain optimistic about the global LTE deployment and our strong position in wireless deployments. We expect the industrial and aerospace defense segment to be up, driven by continued program-related strength in aerospace and defense. Broadcast, automotive and consumer is expected to be flat. As a result, we are expecting total sales for the December quarter to be flat to up 4%. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 46%.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%. The sequential decrease in gross margin percent is driven by product mix as 28-nanometer revenue grows and older product revenue declines. In addition, as inventory begins to decline, we expect a negative impact to gross margin. For the full fiscal year we expect gross margin percent to be between 69% and 70%.","Operating expenses in the December quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Other income and expense for the December quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $6 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 272 million shares. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While September revenue was in line with our guidance, I'm very pleased that we continue to deliver strong profitability. Gross margin increased to a record 71.9% and operating margin to 33.1%, both significantly higher than our expectations. These contributed to earnings per share of $0.62. As we had predicted, 28-nanometer revenue was flat sequentially, driven by a forecasted pause in China LTE activity.","As we head into the second half of our fiscal year 2015, we're anticipating 28-nanometer revenue to renew its significant growth. This will be driven by a broad set of applications in wired communications, industrial, data center, defense and automotive markets, complemented by the strength of increasing LTE deployment. We anticipate 28-nanometer sales to exceed $150 million in the December quarter, driving overall sales growth for the company.","28-nanometer product generation is without doubt the most successful node in our history, will serve as the growth driver for the company for several years going forward. Our 28-nanometer sales target in fiscal year 2015 is $600 million, an increase of approximately 60% from the previous fiscal year.","At the 20-nanometer node, independent customer feedback indicates that we have approximately a one-year lead over the competition, both in terms of our ultra-scale silicon maturity and quality of results. This significant technology leadership is delivered in the broadest and most compelling midrange product family, complemented by the industry's only high-end family. This is manifested in the largest FPGA in the industry which delivers over 4x the capacity of competitive devices. All these are enabled by the unmatched abilities of our Vivado tool suite, which is uniquely delivering only to Xilinx customers fastest time to market, most efficient device utilization, fast [ph] performance and lowest power.","The record success of the 28-nanometer portfolio, which is still in the early phases of revenue growth, combined with the competitiveness, breadth and execution to date for already delivered 20-nanometer solutions and about to be delivered in early 2015 16-nanometer ultra-scale portfolio will drive increased share gains against both ASICs ASSPs traditional programmable competition.","Now I will turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Your first question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Ryan Carver \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Ryan Carver in for John.","I know one of the things that has been difficult is to quantify sort of number of base stations being deployed in China. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us understand relative to sort of the 3G cycle, you know, this quarter or sort of the cycle to date for 4G versus sort of the ramp in 3G. And I guess what I'm trying to think about is, you know, kind of dollar content for base station. I think you guys have talked about a 2x increase from 2G to 3G and a 3x increase from 2G to 4G. But it seems like wireless revenue, at least from sort of the peaking period in 2010, is probably down currently. So I'm just trying to understand from a like-for-like perspective in terms of base station units, how you guys sort of think about that and if the content growth is actually playing out as expected.","Jon Olson","Yes. Well, first off, Ryan, it's very difficult to compare these two ramps because we are still very much in the middle stages of 4G and we've already seen that the predictability has been quite difficult, primarily because of shortages in the supply chain vis-a-vis what China Mobile might prefer they want to do. So, comparing the number of base stations generation to generation, I just can't -- I don't have any good rule of thumb for you to figure that out.","I mean I do think that 4G number of base stations deployed will be a greater number of base stations than 3G in the end when you think of all the technologies. And we are still very much in the ramp-up of that capability across China. So I would say the way I had thought about 3G ramp was that it was very fast, very sharp, up, level off for a while and then came down relatively sharply. This is -- this has had a lot more volatility relative to 4G versus 3G. So it's a pace issue that to me has turned out to be very different so far. And again, it's because of the supply chain issues they have.","Now relative to content, I think we've said in the past that all base stations are not necessarily created equal in terms of their -- both the OEMs who manufacture them relative to FPGA content by OEM, and also then again the various models of centralized versus distributed, remote radio heads versus centralized, things like that.","But when you look at the manufacturers that are using, in the radio, cars, in particular, all FPGA implementation, it's really clear to us that there's a 50% revenue increase over 3G. Those manufacturers who are using ASIC deployments with FPGA companionships, then that percentage doesn't hold quite as easily. And so it does depend on the mix of which OEM we're talking about. And each of those OEMs have different levels of logistics issues in the 4G technology rollout as we sit here today.","Ryan Carver \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good, thanks. And as a quick follow-up, I think the magnitude of the industrial performance for the September quarter was certainly a bit above expectations. Can you just kind of walk through how this -- how you think this is going to play out? You obviously are guiding it a bit higher in December quarter. How should we think of that kind of going into the first part of next year? And I guess as a correlation to that, what's, you know, do you guys expect gross margins to come down as base units, kind mix lower as a percentage of revenue?","Jon Olson","Yes. We have a huge end-market mix going on right now that's driving that gross margin up this quarter as a result of all of our industrial -- all sub-segments within the industrial category going up in the September quarter. And then the guide is for aerospace and defense subcategory to go up, the other two being ISM and test and measurement will be flat to down. So there's a little bit of a difference there.","The aerospace and defense is clearly program-related. And we pushed a lot of programs -- several programs got pushed into the September quarter, out of June into September for us, that's contributing to this. And we are expecting strong aerospace and defense again one more quarter. And this is a very seasonal bracket around the government fiscal year. Typically, in March you would see aerospace and defense then declining. And then our belief is the offset to that will be the communications business growing significantly during that time period.","Ryan Carver \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. Good results, guys.","Jon Olson","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura","Thanks. Hi, Jon. Hi, Moshe. And yeah, congrats on the good results. I imagine it's a pretty tough environment out there. Jon, just seeing the strong growth in base products and industrial aerospace combined with the 72% gross margin, I think may start to feed speculation that sales this past quarter were artificially boosted by last-time buys. And so I was wondering if you could address that. And then I have a follow-up.","Jon Olson","Yes. So it is true that the aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific and medical category does have very long design-in and long tails relative to when they ramp to production. So that would lead you to believe or understand that many of our older products, when those end-markets grow, it's more of our older products that are contributing to the biggest part of that, not just our new products, which is a little different than maybe some of the end-markets we have. And so when you see this new product category going down and communications going down where there's a lot of new products sold into the wireless technology, you have this big swing in the mix, meaning comms down, new products down, base products way up because of those particular two end-markets that grew quite dramatically.","So inside of those -- the base products is the last-time buy, but it isn't the only element of base products and it isn't the only element that gets sold into those technologies. Essentially Virtex-5, Virtex-4, those are not considered last-time buy products, were very strong contributors in the aerospace and the ISM end-markets as well. But also some of the even older products and some of those were considered last-time buys.","So I don't know about the word artificial. We'll take whatever business we get. But you're right; there is this big push-up of these end-markets that will -- there'll be a flop as the seasonality hits us later on aerospace and defense, and it will come down some. And that's driving the 72% gross margin.","We remain confident on the 68% to 70% range for running the business at this point in time. And we did have this higher profitability because of the end-market mix, and will return to a more balanced mix over time.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess in light of the current macro environment, which seems to have weakened recently, and your comments about supply chain constraints in communications, how do you feel about the fiscal 2015 target of 5%. Is that still a realistic target for this fiscal year?","Jon Olson","Yes. So we aren't forecasting the fourth quarter in this call, and that may get you to think that we're backing away from the 5%. But quite frankly, it's really highly dependent on this wireless supply chain shortage issue. We've had large wireless OEM customers say we would be taking more FPGAs if we had more power amplifiers. They've made that statement to us. And so the whole notion that China Mobile claims they want to do a couple hundred thousand more base stations this year, I don't see where those units -- excuse me, the supply chain is going to be able to support that in the short order based on what we see.","And so the fourth quarter for us is a growth quarter for 28-nanometer. It is a growth quarter vis-a-vis what we think will end up in December. Whether we -- it's definitely possible we could get to the 5%, but we are not making that commitment at this point in time due to this reduced visibility.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura","And is this issue with the power amplifiers, is this just a timing issue, meaning that you're not sure if you're going to, you know, ship X number of FPGAs in March or whether it will spill over to June? Or --","Jon Olson","We don't believe we're going to lose share - we're losing any share in this time period. It is a matter of when they are going to ship, the timing of that, when the allocation of power amplifiers increases, if it ever does. We don't produce those, so therefore I can't give you a good reading on when that is going to be alleviated. But we don't think this impacts the total dollars for the overall China LTE deployment for us. It's timing.","Romit Shah \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Thanks, Jon.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. My first question, Jon and Moshe, with respect to communications for the reported quarter, it sounds like it was weaker than what you had guided to because you had said down but it came in way lower, down 19. My question really is, given how big you now are at Huawei and also given your success on the radio side, are you aware of any ASIC conversions going on with HiSilicon? Because it's our understanding that HiSilicon's business has been on a tear the last couple of quarters. So that was my first question.","And second is on the capital allocation, Jon. Could you just remind us what is the company thinking on capital allocation and also how much buyback do you have in the arsenal? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Sure. On the comms, comms was down quite a bit. And the biggest part of it was the wireless piece that was down versus the wired. But wired was also down quite, you know, from a double-digit perspective, you know, pretty healthy. But think of it more like two-thirds of that was wireless and maybe a third was wired at the highest level.","It really -- I mean none of that was caused by any substitution from an ASIC perspective at all. This is -- HiSilicon and Huawei continue to work very closely together. There are ASICs on the board. We don't, you know, we're not being substituted out in any of the companionships that is anything material that would drive a lower overall Huawei number from us versus our expectations. So I guess the answer to your question is really no, we're not seeing that necessarily on the wireless side. ","From a capital allocation perspective, we did increase our repurchase level quite significantly in the first half of our fiscal year. And our strategy has really been to first define what we think the right answer for the dividend is and try to be a consistent increaser of dividend over time, and then the remainder of the cash allocated to return back to shareholders. It's really opportunistic from using repurchases as the balance to that.","And as we see, you know, as we see what happened in the stock market to us last quarter, we thought it was appropriate for us to increase our buyback significantly. We aren't gated by a 70% number or an 80% number or 100% number. We're gated but what we think is the right time to buy back and our confidence relative to the business model that we have. And so we've made the call to increase it significantly in the first half. We still have, on the current authorization, a little less than $200 million available as approved by the Board of Directors.","Ambrish Srivastava \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. So it's consistent, no change. Thank you, Jon.","Jon Olson","Right.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to talk about the 28-nanometer revenue target at $600 million. I'm wondering what is the contribution from wireless in that. Is it fair to think it's about 35%, 40% of that, or is it less or more? I just want to get some rough ballpark of how much wireless contributes to that.","Jon Olson","Yes. Actually I'm a little bit at a loss. I'd have to look into that for you, Vivek.","You know, Kintex is by far the biggest driver, and that's in the neighborhood of 40% or 50% of our overall number in wireless. And Kintex is the primary parts that go into the wireless technology for China, at the 28-nanometer level. But I think I need to go dig into that. I haven't really looked at the end-markets split of 28-nanometer that closely. I don't want to throw out a bad number. I don't think I mind giving you a range; I just don't have the number at my fingertips.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I guess, Jon, maybe where I'm going with that question is that, what is giving you the confidence that you will be able to achieve $600 million at 28 nanometers given that wireless is the growth driver and there is some uncertainty on the pace of the build-out and then just the supply of other components? Why do you think you will be able to achieve $600 million in 28-nanometer revenue?","Moshe Gavrielov","Vivek, this is Moshe. Our target is 600. If you examine our comments closely, that's driven by a whole host of markets. The amount of design wins, the breadth, the depth transcends all markets. And what happens is at different points in time, different markets tend to grow at different rates.","Generally speaking, if you take out the ones which are lumpier, and wireless falls into that. There are, you know, in particular, wireless in China tends to come in big lumps, driven by external elements. But if you take that out, then 28-nanometer has been growing constantly every single quarter since we started. It took a huge leap in the December and March quarters, and those were driven by wireless. But then as -- and that's LTE in China. But as that took a pause, then the other elements continued to grow.","So it would be appropriate it to think that wireless is a driver, but it's not the only driver, and to assume that over time what happens is design wins in other markets start to turn to revenue. We expect some of those, and they are turning to revenue, have been over the past quarters. One which will start in the next calendar year to accelerate is, for example, automotive. In addition, we do expect wired comms to somewhat -- a little later than we had expected, but we do expect that to catch on. So long answer to a question, but it is multi-markets, it's not only wireless.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Very helpful, Moshe. And maybe just as a follow-up to that, I think the investor worry is that if, let's say, the China base station build-out does peak, right, over the next couple of quarters, are there enough of other applications out there to help you grow into your target revenues? Because when I look at the last eight or ten years of the communications and data center revenues from you guys or even with your competitor, it's only grown half the time. Right? So it coincides with the CapEx cycles and it seems like that CapEx cycle could peak next year. So do you think there is enough of range of applications outside of wireless and China base stations that you can still grow the overall company at above the rate of semiconductors?","Moshe Gavrielov","You know, I'm loathe to provide anything vis-a-vis the rate of semiconductors. So I'd rather just focus on our numbers. And those are the ones that we are responsible for. And what is driving our growth now is a very virtuous product cycle with a huge and very broad number of design wins across all applications. And that is -- and hence, we are very confident that 28-nanometer, just due to the breadth and depth of our offering and the number of design wins, will be by far our largest node. And that is driving our growth.","As part of that, this long-awaited ability to grow the fam through ASIC replacement and ASSPs is starting to happen. Again, it's happening a little more slowly, unfortunately. But there is no doubt, and as the Zynq product offering starts to gather momentum, that it's all ASSP replacement because it clearly changes -- enables us to displace ASSPs.","ASICs are happening at the high-end. They are happening quite broadly now as the ASIC market is devolving and it's becoming less and less viable except for high-volume, very high-volume consumer type applications. So all of those are growth vectors. And that is helping grow our market. It's helping grow the entire programmable market. And that should enable us not to be necessarily linked to any previous cycle. It is a growth arena potential, and I absolutely would agree that we have yet to demonstrate that. But that is happening in terms of design wins. The transition to revenue will enable us to do that.","So we are very confident in that trend. And the growth -- I'll take one example. Automotive is a market we had very, very, very peripherals play in, in the past. And we expect -- and it's a market that develops relatively slowly. But in terms of our design wins and our confidence in those design wins we expect to see significant growth in calendar 2015 and calendar 2016 and calendar 2017, in that area. We really did not have a huge play in previous generations.","Wired comms, again, is another area where 28-nanometer has yet to fall into a stride and rhythm there. And that's more delayed and we had expected. But again, those design wins are now moving into production and they will, over the next year or so, translate to revenue. So I think there's a lot -- if you look at the data and the details, and there's a lot of reasons that -- to not to believe that previous cycles are necessarily a perfect predictor of what will happen now. This time it is different.","Vivek Arya \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I hope so. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to go back, Jon. You said that the quarter played out fairly as you expected, and obviously you didn't tell us exactly what numbers to model. But obviously comm was down significantly and industrial up. Jjust wanted to make sure that that was your comment, that it all played out. And you've seen fairly soft comments on the wired side. I was surprised that wireless was the weaker one. What is wired looking like as you go forward? You're looking for growth. Have you seen these pockets of weakness that others are seeing?","Jon Olson","Yes. The characterization that the quarter played out as we anticipated, all end-markets went in the direction we said. Comms was down a little bit more and industrial and aerospace and defense was up a little bit more than we'd anticipated. And so there was a little bit more of a pronounced down and up in those two specific, you know, those specific cases.","And I'm sorry, and the rest of your question, Blayne --","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","The second part was the wired, there's been several data points that wired is kind of getting worse. You seem to see it going up.","Jon Olson","Yeah. Wired was -- the wired issue is that we had a couple of very large customers who had taken a lot of product the previous quarter for -- a lot of this was around access and transport capabilities. And there's some inventory adjustment going on in some cases and also they're beginning a transition from 40-nanometer technology to our 28-nanometer technology, so they were buying quite a bit of the older products earlier. And they're going to start to transition all their new products to 28-nanometer over time.","So it was again customer specific. The overall trend for wired is still up. And as Moshe just articulated, we are expecting 28-nanometer in wired to grow in the coming quarters pretty significantly.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. And then just secondly, on the industrial A&D market, huge sequential. Was that primarily defense as you had talked about? Was that the vast majority of the contribution? And then when you look into December, it's growing again. Is that still the defense snapping back after the transition? And can you just go over the seasonality there again? I was kind of confused on the comments. Does it come back down to a more normalized level?","Jon Olson","Yeah. The high-level category, which includes aerospace and defense and industrial, scientific, medical, and test and measurement, all three of those categories grew in the September quarter. Aerospace and defense subcategory grew a lot. And that was consistent with what we had talked about before, that it was way low the last couple of quarters on a run rate basis and it was going to bounce back and catch up.","Going forward in December, aerospace and defense subcategory is going up and the other two are flat to down. And so the increase won't be as pronounced in that overall category but it will be driven by aerospace and defense. Then what is typical for us is, in March and June, is that the aerospace and defense subcategory goes down because of the seasonality around bracketing the end of the government fiscal year in September. And we have had this effect fairly consistently over many years of the company.","So there is definitely going to be some up in those categories and then some down in aerospace and defense as we get to March and June quarters. I hope that was clear.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yeah, very clear, thank you. And just the node that defense is on, I mean into that context of the last-time buys.","Jon Olson","The last-time buy node is 130-nanometer, a part of our 130-nanometer capability. And again, aerospace and defense, industrial and scientific and medical buy 130, 90, 40, 28-nanometer. It's across the board, but it's always weighted towards the lower, you know, the older products just because of the nature of that business, very long design-in and very long qualification.","Blayne Curtis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Thanks, Jon.","Jon Olson","Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hi, good afternoon. Just as a follow-up to some questions that have already taken place regarding the December quarter outlook. A quarter ago you stated your expectation for revenue to be down starting in the December quarter. Since then, China Mobile raised their TD-LTE base station target by 200K so that's at least $60 million in incremental revenue, which will be about 10% of your September quarter revenue. Are there other end-markets representing an offset to your expectations for the quarter going to the December quarter? Could be the wired market? Or is it because you don't think you're going to ship more than incremental 200K TD-LTE base units by yearend or by calendar year end?","Jon Olson","Yeah. I'm not sure I got the very front end of your declarative statement on what we said. I don't believe -- if you said we said wireless would be down in December, we did not say that last quarter.","Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Total revenue.","Jon Olson","We did not say total revenue would be down either in the December quarter. We've said that we were going to grow in the second half of the fiscal year, which is December and March. So that's not us that said that.","And so inside of that growth is a strong growth in wireless and a strong growth in wired that we had modeled into the second half. To your point around the incremental 200,000 base stations, earlier I made the comment around the shortage issue, and I have a lack of confidence that China Mobile will be successful in getting all the base stations to deploy that. And this will push out into calendar 2015.","Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. And as a follow-up, is it fair to assume that, as a result, your China exposure within wireless is going to continue to increase in the March quarter, and as such, I guess we could make implications for gross margin given the mix?","Jon Olson","So, yes, we do believe our China mix will continue to increase as we go throughout the year. And it is true that the gross margin will move back down, as we said, in December and again in March as mix -- as our overall product mix and customer mix gets a little more normal to our business and then we fall into the 68% to 70% range that we've been forecasting. When you take the effect of what happened to us this quarter and our belief of the margin number for March, we do believe that the gross margin will be between 69% and 70% for the full fiscal year.","Tristan Gerra \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great. Thank you.","Jon Olson","Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Srinivas Pajjuri with CLSA Research. Your line is open.","Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research","Jon, a couple of questions. On the supply constraints that you mentioned, do you think that's only impacting the radio card build, or do you think that's impacting the baseband card build as well?","Jon Olson","Srini, I think it's impacting both because I think it's -- certainly, our business is more impacted by the radio card, meaning we have a higher revenue content in our overall wireless business than radio. It's about half radio and the rest, the other half, is between baseband and microwave backhaul business. But for us, you know, having shortages on the radio card is a bigger deal to us, but I do believe that the power amplifier issues are both baseband and radio card.","Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe for Moshe, you mentioned that, I think, you have about a year lead in 20-nanometer. Given that 2016 is just around the corner, how big do you think 20 is going to be for the industry?","Moshe Gavrielov","We expect the sum of 20 and 16 to approach what 28 will be. And it's difficult for us to make the division between the two. Fundamentally, 20-nanometer for us will be two years ahead of 16-nanometer and two years ahead of any competing product in an advanced node. So typically that provides us with a pretty reasonable portion of revenue. And our product offering in 20 is very broad. It has the midrange and it has a high-end and super-high-end component to it. So we're very bullish on what it will provide. But clearly it won't be as good as 28, which for a variety of reasons actually is broader and will have a longer life due to some cost-related elements. So that's why our analysis is 20 and 14, 16 will be, combined, at best like 28.","Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research","Okay, great. And then, Jon, just one clarification. As we head into the next quarter, you are guiding down the share count pretty meaningfully. Is it just the buybacks and the convert? Or is there anything else I should be aware of? Thank you.","Jon Olson","No. It was our best estimate of choosing share price to compute the dilution with, from the converts, and then implementing our buyback strategy.","Srinivas Pajjuri \u2013 CLSA Research","Great. Thank you.","Jon Olson","Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Vinh with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","John Vinh \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question that I had was just wanted to clarify the expectations for a rebound in wireless in the March quarter. Is that solely predicated on the constraints on RFPAs starting to ease? Are you also making some assumptions about some FDD-LTE contributions in the March quarter as well?","Jon Olson","Yes, I think it's more, John, I think it's more around the phase three introduction for the TD and the fact that we would end up with, I would say, a full quarter of that effect. While there will be some builds of FD during that time period, we believe it's not the biggest driver; it's really around TD. And again, we don't -- since we don't make the power amplifiers, we don't know for sure when it's easing. We're going by what our customers are telling us, that they believe the March quarter, that they'll be ordering more FPGAs for us, so they must be confident that they are going to have an adequate supply to be able to do that. But it's really around the phase three timing is what we're counting on the most in order to drive that growth in the March quarter. ","John Vinh \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. And then my follow-up question is, if you look at kind of the ramp of China Mobile and TD-LTE, it seems like their macro base station deployments could be down next year. Should we think about China wireless peaking this year, or is there a possibility that some of the FDD contributions could drive continued growth in China wireless next year?","Jon Olson","Yeah, there are a lot of moving parts, as you can imagine, here with what might get pushed into calendar 2015, being the March quarter, versus what might happen to us in December. Our belief is that calendar 2015 will be higher than, you know, maybe it's only slightly higher, but higher than calendar 2014 relative to our overall China-related business. And yes, some of that will be FD, particularly in the second half of calendar 2015.","John Vinh \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey, guys. Congrats on the strong result and guide. Jon, a lot of questions about the industrial and aerospace and defense. Now that it's 40% of your revenues, at least in this last quarter, could you give us a rough estimate about how big that aero and defense side is? And how long does that tend to adjust to the downside similar to what it has now done for, it looks like, a couple quarters to the upside when it does in fact turn? Thanks.","Jon Olson","Yes. So it's, I mean it's typically aerospace and defense has been around 15% of our total revenue of the company. And obviously this last quarter it's a little higher than that, by a percent or two. So it is larger. And some of it was created by the fact that we had such a low point, lower than we would have expected, in the summertime, and that's driven that up little bit. So it's one of those things you have to look at over the whole year and compare it to the previous year to kind of get a normality.","I would definitely expect, based on some of the programs that have gone through, are going through for us in September and December, that March will be down, I would say, quite a bit. I don't know if I want to use the word significantly because we are not always sure of what programs are going to be happening out there, and it seems like the military activity on a worldwide basis is pretty brisk right now. So there's all kinds of things that surprise us sometimes on what programs come back and requiring more product.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And is the typical seasonality for the other two portions of that first cut segments to be an offset seasonally in those March and June quarters?","Jon Olson","Yeah, generally, the industrial, scientific and medical is a little bit softer in the summertime leading into September. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't. But yes, there's going to be offsets there.","There's going to be offset in automotive. Our automotive business, while it grew this quarter, September quarter we do expect next year for it to grow quite significantly. And Moshe talked about some of the drivers earlier on that one. So yes, we do see offsets in that category test and measurement. Again that can be sometimes choppy. We do expect some growth there as well.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","If I could sneak one more in really quickly. Can you just walk us through why the inventory coming down is going to weigh on the gross margin? And just how did the inventory get so high to begin with? I think it's at an all-time record as far as I can tell. Then I'll go away. Thanks.","Jon Olson","Yeah. It's definitely higher on a dollar -- forget the days part for a minute because that's a mathematic or arithmetic calculation, it involves our cost of sales number. But if you look at the absolute balance of net inventory, it is higher than we would have liked to have it.","And if you recall back a few quarters ago, we made probably, now a year ago, we said that we were going to start to grow inventory for two reasons. One is we wanted to make sure we had adequate supply for the peaks of 28-nanometer, specifically in the wireless segment. And think of China in that particular area. And number two, our primary foundry building -- our foundry building 28-nanometer product was going to be constrained, and we wanted to build ahead of that constraint to make sure we had adequate inventory. So we built up a significant amount of safety stock. ","When this volatility started to happen in the China wireless, because of logistics constraints of other products, we had built up an overshot, if you will, the amount of safety stock that we needed to build. And so we started to cut our wafers a quarter or two ago, and the effect of that is, as the outs happen from the foundry, that effect is going to start December and March for us.","So what that really means is, from a, why-is-there-margin impact, is we built up inventory a lot. We built up some products effectively several quarters ago at slightly higher cost. Costs are reflected at actual costs. And as that moves through inventory and out as reduced inventory, you end up having to flesh out some of the more expensive inventory. And you are seeing some downward margin pressure.","Again, as you look at the whole year time period you are going to see right at our expectations, maybe even a little higher. We said 68% to 70% and now we are forecasting 69% to 70%. So the overall business model thesis is intact. There are some fluctuations driven by the inventory build and decline.","Ross Seymore \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Joe Meares \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","This is Joe Meares calling in for Will Stein. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, understanding that you are not going to be forecasting out beyond the quarter, there has been some expectation for increased weakening the macro environment. I just wondered if you could give Xilinx's view there.","Jon Olson","Yes. That's not without notice on our part, as the European GDP forecast continue to go down and I would say quite a bit of volatility and toughness in the U.S. China actually has been the source of strength for us, not just the wireless piece but also industrial side. And Japan has been kind of okay for us on a year-on year basis. There's a lot of activity going on there that can put some pressure, particularly on CapEx, in the comms space.","We alternately feel good and not so good about what's going on there with respect to some of our customers and the effect that they are having, it is having on them. But to balance that out, Joe, there is certainly strength in our new product growth, which, as companies produce new products and start to ramp new products, even in this macro situation we end up selling a lot of products because we have increased content going in some of these pieces of equipment.","So we do think we have some counterbalance to the macro effect. And that's why we are still forecasting growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Obviously, any sort of very large scale macro collapse would impact us just like everybody else. We're not immune to that.","Joe Meares \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","That's very helpful, thank you. And just as a follow-up, I guess if you could give any comment on demand trends in the channel? And that's it for me.","Jon Olson","Yeah. Demand trends in the channel, our smaller customers continue to be a little on the weak side, as they have been throughout the year. Our overall distribution revenue though is still, because of the new product effect has been on an upward trend. But some of the I'll say smaller customers, large customer balance is still, you know, we are still seeing the effect of slightly more business coming from the larger customers than smaller customers.","Joe Meares \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","That's very helpful. Thanks again.","Jon Olson","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners","Thanks. First question, ultra-scale 20 nanometers, any data on yield improvements, how that's comparing to 28 nanometers? And also for 28, any manufacturing cost reductions that remain at this point? Thanks.","Moshe Gavrielov","So, ultra-scale is doing extremely well both in terms of product introduction on the midrange, which we led with, and the high-end. And we are about to deliver the ultra-high-end solutions to our customers. With regards to defect density and maturity of the products, it's ahead of where we were at the same point in time at 28-nanometer. And 28-nanometer was very smooth introduction for us. But 20-nanometer, and this is the second-generation we have done with TSMC, has been extremely smooth. ","So it's going really well. And it's moving into production on all fronts. And the defect densities are ahead of where the 28-nanometer was at that same point in time. The product quality is even higher than what the 28-nanometer was at an equivalent point in time. So for us this is as smooth an introduction as we have ever seen or actually smoother than we've seen, both in terms of the product design in the manufacturing flow.","Jon Olson","I'll make a comment on 28-nanometer. 28-nanometer, we are certainly very pleased with where we are on a defect density basis, which is the biggest driver of cost reductions typically. We aren't down to our lowest level or our lowest expectation yet, but we're doing extremely well there.","But that being said, there are always things we are working on relative to reducing packages and test times and things like that. So we still believe we have some more cost wring out on 28-nanometer, however we -- a lot of the cost reduction has already been reflected.","Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners","Yes. And then for the wired business I know you said there's some program timing issues that have been impacting you. But are you confident it's going to be a better environment? It seems the telecom spending environment is not exactly robust in the developed markets. So, just your thoughts on that going forward.","Jon Olson","Yes. I mean I think we have counted on wired CapEx being a little more favorable than it -- I mean historically we've said very positive things about the CapEx environment. But it really hasn't come true quite the way we thought. But again we have an increased content level at some of the very large communications manufacturers and in certain of their new products with our 28-nanometer generation, both broadly with the very high-end Virtex parts and Zynq, additive to what we already have with, I'll say, regular Virtex and our Kintex lines. So we are expecting the new product growth to help -- be additive to us despite the mixed CapEx spending environment.","Ian Ing \u2013 MKM Partners","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Unverified Participant","This is Joe on for Chris. Thanks for letting me ask a question. So the first question, do you guys have any visibility into hardware versus software for base station upgrades? And if you would talk about maybe the content opportunities relative to each other and any shift between the two going forward, I'd appreciate it.","Jon Olson","I think we are generally seeing hardware deployments, not conversion of existing base stations via software to make those deployments, really not seeing a great deal of that happening. It's really a lot of new base stations and a lot of new radio heads associated with that. Again, the frequencies are radically different. You do need different radio heads. You do need different software implemented in the FPGA. And then we also have Zynq going forward.","So, we really aren't subscribing to the point that there's software upgrades going on in that market, to a large degree.","Unverified Participant","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. And then just as my follow-up, just to follow on to the question about the channel, can you talk about inventories in the channel? And then do you guys have a good grasp on inventories, especially in China? Any color there would be appreciated.","Jon Olson","Yes, our inventories have been pretty lean in the channel. And in fact, the inventory management logistics relationship we have with Avnet is quite good and quite -- and we work together to keep it very lean. So it's not always indicative of what their businesses are not, in other words, what our inventory balance is with them doesn't necessarily imply good or bad business on expectations on their part as we do have this really tight coupling of logistics.","But I would say overall, from an inventory in the channel or inventory at customers across our broad set of end-markets, other than the wireless lumpiness that we've had with excess inventories and a little bit at a few customers in wired, we generally do not see inventory building in the channel across our broad base of end-markets outside of some of the comms areas.","Rick Muscha","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay, certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","I think you brought up a good point of China being more than just wireless. So how did the China industrial segment trend in the September quarter? And how are you seeing that here in the December quarter?","Jon Olson","So generally China industrial has been on a positive trend throughout the year, and we do expect that to continue to show strength. And the penetration across a variety of applications that are vision-related or scientific and medical, which is a huge new opportunity for China's manufacturers to serve that market, we are getting really good uptake in those particular categories. They are building; their industrial base is obviously expanding in China. And there's more manufacturers that are local manufacturers that are contributing equipment to that versus them importing equipment from other areas. So we are participating in that ramp as well. So all in all, we have been pretty positive in that area. It's definitely a source of growth for us in the industrial, scientific and medical category.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","Good to hear. And then data center was a bright spot within your comms business in the second quarter. What were some of the applications that drove this growth? And then how are some of the new applications like workload acceleration and enterprise SSD controllers shaping up to be potential meaningful contributors on a go-forward basis?","Jon Olson","The biggest area of growth this last quarter was storage. And that has been our largest individual contributing revenue area to this point in time, even though the acceleration business and the switch integration capabilities in the data center are other big areas for us that are emerging and we have an increasing number of design wins there; we just don't have the growth in revenue yet. That will come next year. So it's really been -- more of the growth right now has been around storage. And we do anticipate next year to have these other two categories grow more significantly.","Harlan Sur \u2013 JPMorgan","Great. Thank you very much.","Rick Muscha","Okay.

Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, our CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the September quarter and then we will open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.

This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $528 million, down 4% sequentially and within our guidance. We experienced strong new product growth and strong profitability during the quarter as well as a modest recovery in communications.","New product sales increased 11% in the quarter, with increases from our 7 series, Spartan 6 product family and our 20-nanometer UltraScale family which exceeded $15 million in quarterly sales. Zynq adoption continues to be strong across a broad-base of end-markets, including automotive, wireless, industrial and consumer applications.","From an end market perspective sales from communications and data center increased 5%, driven by a modest recovery in Asia and North America. Wired Communication sales were driven by data center access and enterprise applications. For the second quarter in a row wired communications represented the largest contributor of our 28-nanometer sales.","The Industrial and Aerospace and Defense segment declined 12% sequentially with expected decreases from Defense. The combination of Industrial, Scientific and Medical and Test and Measurement declined sequentially with somewhat weaker than anticipated ISM business towards the end of the quarter. Lastly the broadcast, consumer and automotive category was down slightly driven primarily by decreases in broadcast. ","Gross margin was 70.1% for the quarter, at the high end of our guidance driven primarily by customer mix. Operating expenses, including $2 million of amortization expense were $217 million in line with expectations. Other income was a net expense of $9 million. Net income for the quarter was $127 million or $0.48 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the September quarter was $137 million, before $5 million in CapEx. Cash flow for the quarter was impacted by higher receivables, primarily associated with the timing of end of the quarter shipments to our primary distributor partner, who had an extra fiscal week in their quarter.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 266 million shares. There was a 6.5 million shares dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our comparable debt please visit our investor relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 2.4 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and paid $80 million in dividends. As a result we returned over 130% of operating cash flow to the shareholders during the quarter putting us well on track to continue to return over 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year \u201816.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet; cash and investments were $3.5 billion. We had $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $1.9 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased by $9 million sequentially. ","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the December quarter of fiscal year \u201816. The guidance I provide will be inclusive of the extra fiscal week in our quarter which we disclosed in our 10-K filing as well as in today\u2019s earnings release.","Our backlog heading into the December quarter is up sequentially, both Wired and Wireless Communications are forecasted to be up. We believe our key Wireless customers have reduced levels of inventory and as a result we expect continued improvement from China driven by FD LTE deployment activity.","Wired communications continues to be impacted by a weak FX environment, but we are expecting growth during the quarter from OTN and cable infrastructure businesses. We expect our Industrial and Aerospace and Defense segment to be up sequentially driven by return to growth in our space and defense. Lastly we expect all components of the Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive category to be approximately flat. As a result we are expecting total sales to be up 3% to 7% sequentially. The midpoint in this guidance is predicated on [turns] [ph] rate of approximately 48%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69%.","Operating expenses for the December quarter are expected to be approximately $230 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. Other income and expense for the December quarter will be a net expense of $7 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 265 million shares. There will be an adjustment to our full year forecast on CapEx. We are raising our forecast to approximately $40 million for the year up from previous guidance of $25 million as a result of building renovations on our San Jose campus. The tax rate for the December quarter is expected to be 12%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon and good afternoon. Despite the anticipated challenges on the September quarter revenue I'm pleased that Xilinx continued to deliver strong profitability. Gross margin was 70.1% facilitating operating margin of 29%. This is a testament to the strength of our business model, the diversity of the markets we serve, the impact of several corporate initiatives focusing on productivity improvement.","Revenue from our new products category, which delivered robust 11% sequential increase is expected to further accelerate in the December quarter. This gives us growing confidence that the September quarter represents the bottom of the current cycle for Xilinx. As forecasted, last quarter 28-nanometer revenue growth was driven largely by increases in wired communication industrial applications and defense. Special mention is due to our Zynq product family, the industry's first all programable SoC which increased sequentially by nearly 40%, repeating a similar increase in the June quarter.","Our overall 28-nanometer revenue is expected to grow significantly in the December quarter, with sales driven by a majority of our end-markets. These include communication, industrial, automotive, defense and test and measurement. 20-nanometer revenue in September quarter comfortably exceeded $50 million forecast. Majority of the growth continue to be driven by Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only ASIC class 20-nanometer high end product offering.","In the December quarter we are expecting 20-nanometer sales to again post strong growth and exceed $20 million led by wired communications and test and measurement applications. The 16-nanometer node we shipped the industry's first all programmable MPSoC. This product has been already delivered to customers. This is a quarter ahead of schedule highlighting the third consecutive generation of product leadership enabled by stellar execution, by our foundry partner, TSMC, in conjunction with our engineering and operations teams. This exciting new family targets application in embedded vision including ADAS, industrial internet-of-things, 5G wireless systems and will facilitate Xilinx\u2019s expansion into the domain of ASSPs.","Finally, last week we announced the strategic partnership with Qualcomm to deliver industry leading heterogeneous computing solutions. These solutions will deliver new levels of efficiency and performance through FPGA-enabled dynamic work load acceleration on Qualcomm's ARM-Based Server platforms.","As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, top line 3% to 7% sales growth expected in the December quarter is again being driven from our new product category. This is forecasted to deliver another healthy double digit percentage increase comprised by both our 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer leadership portfolios.","We now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. Your first question is from William Stein from SunTrust.","William Stein","Great, thank you for taking my question. I'd like to first ask about the extra week in the quarter, and your expectations for that effect on the P&L. Should we expect that to be sort of a linear view and maybe add roughly 7% to sales or is that an overly optimistic view as to what that adds?","Jon Olson","Hello, it's Jon. I don't know about being overly optimistic or not. But because the way this is a holiday, end of the year kind of thing and what the week's work out they would definitely, kind of piles up towards more of the day of the holiday which are typically not good production time period. I mean the end of our quarter ends up being, I think like January second or something like that. So I mean we are now overlapping both Christmas and the New Years' time.","So I don't think, thinking about it from a 7% or arithmetic way is necessarily the right way. However there is obviously some more shipping days in the quarter as a result of it. And of course we get a full week of expense no matter what.","William Stein","Understood. Thank you and then maybe I can just tackle the cyclical commentary. I think you are pretty explicit that you feel September, Moshe, I think you said September marks the bottom in the cycle for Xilinx. Perhaps, you can help us with the strength by end market when we look out to see what the next cycle, what the upcoming let's say up turn should bring. Would you anticipate that the comment for structure end-market would be the greatest driver of that? And are you seeing -- I missed whether you said you're seeing signs of life in wireless infrastructure in China, whether that's sort -- whether those are -- that spending has started to come back. Thank you. ","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So if you look at it market-by-market there is some recovery in communications, not necessarily from huge, snap backs, in particular and not on wireless. So this does not assume there is a tremendous improvement in wireless. We are seeing improvement in wireless. It has come off the trough. The trough I believe was in this quarter before last and it is improving slowly from that. But there is no huge rebound. We are seeing strength in wired communications that is growing nicely and some of the other markets are growing at a nice level and are driving this. It tends to be a little broad, but Jon do you want to share your specifics?","Jon Olson","Yeah, so I think if you look at our new product growth rate of 11% and an expectation that we're going to have a nice growth in this next quarter as well on new products, I think what we're seeing is bouncing off the bottom. We're seeing some of the designs that we've really started to grow pretty significantly in wired and across automotive and industrial, when we look at our Zynq product family starting to grow very significantly now. And that's a good sign. ","And the two drags that we had going for us through the earlier part of this calendar year was our aerospace and defense business declining from the standpoint of the Joint Strike Fighter Program finally shipments being done. So that is essentially aerospace and defense especially hitting bottom for us in this past quarter. And then the fact that inventory needs to bled off in China particularly. And we believe our customers have reduced their inventory levels of FPGAs that they had in their stores and we're starting to see some signs of more reordering and some more incremental deployments, as Moshe said but not a giant snapback. So those are some of the factors that I think have contributed to our view, in our confidence level that we're going to start moving back up now from the bottom. ","William Stein","Great, thank you. ","Jon Olson","Next question please? ","Operator","Your next question is from Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. ","Gabriela Borges ","Great, thanks so much for taking the question. This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. Maybe just a follow-up on the earlier comment on inventory levels and the supply chain. If you could share with us any metrics specifically on inventory at wireless OEM customers and then to the extent you could talk about inventory and distribution more broadly across the end markets and where those levels are compared normal levels that will be very helpful. Thank you. ","Jon Olson","I think just as a general comment, inventories across most of our end markets are pretty lean and including in distribution, despite the fact that we had a buildup in distribution right at the end of the quarter, but again that was timing from when Avnet's quarter end because they had the 14 weeks last quarter which was after our -- a week after our quarter end. So there was some build up there but that really isn't a sign of any sort of long-term business situation. So I think in distribution we're in pretty good shape. ","With respect specifically to wireless it's always difficult to know the true story about what the status is exactly. I think as you recall we've talked about this before. There are base stations that our customers have on loan to the carriers. There are base stations that we're in inventory completed and then there were situations where we know FPGAs were built up in their factories and what we can see the most obviously is the FPGA inventory and that's where we feel we work that down at major customers and there should be more of a demand pull kind of a situation now on a go forward basis, that's our view on that. ","Gabriela Borges","Appreciate the color thanks very much. ","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. I wonder if you could talk again on the wireless infrastructure side, just conceptually as you look forward. I think you said that it was down about 50% year-over-year a couple of quarters ago. If you think about where it could go in the future do you think that, that business for you can exceed the prior peaks or are there some things that would limit it from ever reaching those peaks just conceptually trying to think if we are at the bottom what does the next top look like and where does it compare to the prior?","Moshe Gavrielov","So if you look at wireless, there is various elements and there's 4G deployment and the next major surge will be 5G deployment, which were already designed into a lot of the prototypes which will be demonstrated in the next few years. But reality there is long time before there is the massive growth in 5G. So if you are looking for the short-term we do expect for it to grow it\u2019s unlikely in the short-term to get to the previous peak. That peak was driven by a surge in China. What we\u2019re seeing now is deployment in India but that is viewed as a much smaller market and then other markets are deploying at a low rate. ","So I don\u2019t see us returning to that previous peak, which I believe was in the March 2014 quarter any time soon. I do expect us to see a recovery from the trough of the previous peak it\u2019s going to take time and it will probably require a combination of elements to return to that level.","Jon Olson","I would just point out that that previous peak that Moshe referred to was an artificial peak in retrospect meaning there was a lot of inventory build -- being built up by our customers who all thought they were going to get a higher share, it was earlier in the China LTE rollout of TD and I think we had many customers thinking they were going to get a bigger share out of that. And so in retrospect that\u2019s why I called it the artificial peak.","Ross Seymore","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Securities.","Srini Pajjuri","Thank you. Jon. Just a question on OpEx then I have a follow-up. So obviously the extra week is, I think impacting the OpEx in the December. How should we think about it as we head into the March quarter and beyond?","Jon Olson","Yeah, so we provided full year guidance for R&D and SG&A and we do still expect to be in that range and maybe SG&A a little bit towards the bottom of that range quite frankly but there's still a couple of puts and takes going on, on that. But we\u2019re very comfortable with the previous range. We can get you those numbers if you need them it\u2019s we have\u2026","Srini Pajjuri","I think I have them too, yeah, that\u2019s great. And then maybe for Moshe. You put out a press release a couple of days ago on the Qualcomm partnership. I guess one of the reasons that Intel has been talking about for acquiring Altera is I guess they want to integrate FPGA into the x86 die. I am just curious if this partnership with Qualcomm first, is it exclusive to Qualcomm and then I think you also mentioned that down the road you plan to offer integrated solutions does that mean that Qualcomm would be offering fully integrated single die solutions with Xilinx FPGAs on it? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So let me first answer with regards to Qualcomm. So we will have a range of solutions that we work on with Qualcomm, start from cards and then move to higher level of integrations we haven\u2019t defined what those higher levels of integration are but we are working closely with them. And this is a program that started two years ago and what was shown at the rollout was that the first server that they were providing to their software developers and to their customers as a development platform and there was in parallel a board which had our device on it which connected with that and provided the 10 to 50x acceleration for certain sets of applications. And so that's the situation there. ","We have a very tight relationship with Qualcomm. It's not an exclusive relationship. One of the opportunities we have is we believe that the data center market is an emerging market. There are three elements to it. There is a networking part, there is a storage part and there is a acceleration part, which is the one which is getting the most praise. But isn't the only one. So the first two are obviously we are in a good position there. With regards to the third what we are seeing is there is a lot of competitive architectures, x86, ARM and others which are pursuing that market at this point in time. Clearly Intel has the highest market share. But it is expected to have more than one set of solution, that is driven by the customers who are very large independent companies and they desire to control their own destiny.","So we do believe that that will over time provide interesting growth opportunity for us and we have a strategy that enables us to participate at different levels of integration with all of the players in that market.","Srini Pajjuri","That's great, and when do you expect production revenues from this partnership, Moshe? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, with the Qualcomm I can't tell you without disclosing when they are going to ship the product hence, I am precluded from answer that, but other partners are in different stages of deployment. A few are a little further ahead, a few are further behind. And so over time we do expect this to be a significant growth opportunity for us. But this is not measured in months. This is couple of years out at the earliest before it starts becoming visible.","Srini Pajjuri","Great, thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Danely from Citigroup.","Christopher Danely","Hey, thanks guys. Just one question on the call end [ph] market. So if you look at the spending patterns from the China carriers and looks like it's got pretty strong in the second half of this year. So how much of this are you guys seeing and then conversely getting into the next calendar year, it looks like spending is down. So any thoughts you have on the market for next year would be appreciated as well.","Moshe Gavrielov","Yeah, Chris, on the spending pattern out of China and just generally Asia, as we have been communicating here, we do see positive signs. But we don't really see -- we see the positioning that there could be brisker growth out there in the next two quarters for us, the rest of our fiscal, but our customers are certainly not committing to that level at this point in time.","So it's one of those situations again where you don't know whether it's a false signal that they are saying 'hey, it could be bigger than this or may not be bigger than this. So we put a number in that we think is more in the center of likelihood there. And relative to next year it's very difficult to forecast for the whole year on the wireless segment. But I don't think we are looking at it, based on how poor this year is. I don't think we're looking at it as a down year for us next year, that's about all I'll say on that.","Christopher Danely","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","Great, thank you. If we go back to the server acceleration business, can you talk about how big you think that opportunity ultimately can be, Altera had talked about it as a $1 billion type of long-term opportunity, Intel made it the focal point of the transaction. Do you agree that it could be that big and then I have a follow-up?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, it's an emerging market and it's a little too early to figure out how it will turn out. But it is clearly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Could it be a billion dollar? Yes, it could be a billion dollars. But I think it's pretty mature to sort of count on it being that big because it is an emerging market and we expect it to be a very bifurcated market. Again it's sort of important to look at the end customers and these are the big data center company in North America and then there is the big data center companies in China. Each of them has an ecosystem and software environment that they totally control. ","And they tend to have an application, which but their applications are different and they tend to do it their own way. So we do expect that to come out with a vast platter of solutions and we believe we'll be in a good position to provide that as opposed to big data small number of solutions which we believe will be the competitive approach. ","Joseph Moore","Okay, great. And then following up on that, to the extent that you've talked about other architectures other than x86 in that market, can you talk about your approach within x86, you sort of assume that the lion share of servers is going to remain in x86. What's your ability to compete, how important is that, that you're not in the co-packaged part with the processor? How did you compete external to that?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, the biggest challenge to integration is power. And if you look at this market it tends to use a pretty high performance processor and a relatively large FPGA. You need those in order to get the acceleration. If you look at those, those tend to be relatively power hungry devices. So there is a limit to what you can do by integrating them to one package. So even if it's just interfacing to an Intel device we believe that we will be able to provide a companion device which will enable a differentiated solution for several of the players in that market. So we do expect to play in that market too, and definitely in any non-Intel market we expect to be to have a very strong position with regards to servicing the requirements we are the primary provider of FPGA solutions and the largest provider of FPGA solutions in the market. ","Joseph Moore","That's very helpful thank you very much. ","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question is from the David Wong from Wells Fargo. ","David Wong ","Thank you very much. Can you tell us a bit more about your plans for 16 nanometer? So you've got your first product, will there be a rollout of a large number of more products in the near future? Or will be -- these be spread over time?","Moshe Gavrielov","So what typically happens is when we rollout the first device that it goes through at length the evaluation phase. And as soon as we get to a clear understanding of the level of functionality we then do a rapid rollout of the full on devices. The functionality of this initial device has exceeded all expectations. We got it back faster and it operates much, much better and hence we already shipped it to customers just to sort of demonstrate the level of functionality. So I would expect the rollout of the next devices to be as fast as we can. ","We do need to complete the evaluation of first device. That takes significant amount of time. Typically this process takes about a year, to year and half from the first device until you have most of the family rolled out. And given the success and the fast turnaround we got from TSMC and the functionality, both on the manufacturing side, on the engineering side, we should do better than we have in any previous generation. And it is a very broad and deep product offering. It has a very high performance processor sub-system with significant number of embedded dedicated, accelerators. And the combination of those will enable us to take it and compete, overtime against the ASSPs in more and more markets. ","So it is, we think this is a watershed moment for us in terms of the rollout.","David Wong ","Great, thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","Yes, thanks. Question on one of the sub markets. You said that ISM was weaker than expected especially at the end of the quarter. Perhaps kind of what\u2019s driving that and does that continue into this quarter for some period?","Jon Olson","Yeah, at this point in time we don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a bellwether to any sort of cycle. It\u2019s just was, I would say consistent with maybe what we\u2019ve seen in some other component companies, a little softness in that market for a short time period. So it\u2019s the matter of returns profile. We still -- we are expecting continued strength on our new products in that particular area, some of the older designs, just we\u2019re taking a pause probably some inventory adjustments there. But the new products continue to be strong in that particular end market. ","So I think it was more -- it\u2019s just more of a -- just the situation for how things played out at the end of the quarter than it is any sort of a forecast for the future.","Moshe Gavrielov","Ian if I can just add color, it\u2019s a market that develops very, very slowly and as a result to the extent there was a downturn, it was the older technologies right. But what we have seen and this was driven by Zynq, is in 28-nanometer we actually saw significant and vibrant growth. So and this is an expansion play for us because the Zynq product offering is different from anything we\u2019ve had in the past. ","So we are now seeing that enable us to grow into new areas and so we fully expect ISM even if there are pull backs from time to time, we expect to see that to be one of our more promising growth markets going forward. And it's Zynq and it\u2019s the MPSoC again given the nature of the design wins some of those design wins even on 28-nanometer five or seven years old and are just now starting to hit the, and become visible on the Zynq side and that will grow to be a bigger part of our business going forward.","Ian Ing","Thanks Moshe. And then longer term question here. I mean how much manufacturing cost improvement is left? I see you have now the second highest gross margins in all of semiconductors I mean do you eventually become like a linear which is very high margin but low growth or are you getting some cost improvements as you migrate to 20-nanometers and 60-nanometers et cetera.","Moshe Gavrielov","This is a never ending process and it\u2019s I have often heard the terms that we reached saturation in terms of our capability to improve in terms of density, cost et cetera and as soon as hear that we set a new bar and surprisingly we hit the new saturation point. So I think the opportunity for improvement while not trivial is very significant and we continue to do that on numerous fronts. And it requires a lot of engineering efforts and both in-house and together with our foundry partners. But I don\u2019t think you should sort of assume this is as good as it get. ","Now with regards to moving to future nodes the good news is that we are reaching the old historic, so called saturation densities with new nodes faster than you reach them with old nodes even though the new nodes are significantly more complex and have more manufacturing layers. So I think in particular if you look at it see their ability to continue to improve and the volumes they run are very helpful to help us improve on those fronts and we continue to push to achieve those regardless of the node both on old node and new node it\u2019s something that we need to do. So the strategy is both to continue to improve in that regard but also to provide market growth and the market growth comes through expanded product capability. ","And that sort of, I will admit that of the past few years, I have two years of not delivering that but we are intent on delivering that going forward, for sure much better than we have in the past two years. ","Jon Olson","I'll just add one comment on that as we -- if there was a question behind your question around are we sacrificing growth to protect margins, no, that's not what we're doing in this. We have here is a situation where we have customer and end market mix that's pretty favorable for us, that we're at the high end of our 68% to 78% stated model for the current period and situation. And there are -- we aren't tied by accepting deals at lower than that margin if need to. We just have a portfolio in the balance and we drive cost reduction where we think volume is going to be and we put more focus on that. And I think you're just seeing a disciplined efficient situation that we put in place in the company and 110% agree with all the things that Moshe just said. ","Ian Ing","Okay, thanks Jon. ","Operator","Your next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann","Thanks. Hey Moshe wanted to go back to the many solutions versus few solutions type of approach and your wording. Is it is since, are you getting questions in sense of urgency from customers directly regarding that many solutions approach as a result of the Intel and Altera announcement earlier this year, thanks?","Moshe Gavrielov","Hans, just to clarify you're asking generally or are you asking with the data centers in particular?","Hans Mosesmann ","Actually yeah data center acceleration, that aspect of potentially why Intel may have wanted the Altera asset?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So with regards to datacenter and the acceleration that subset of applications, as we're going through cloudification or whatever the appropriate word is, and that's a major growth element. A significant portion of the CPUs that are being deployed and now being deployed in these large datacenters in -- and the typical usage is very different from what the general purpose server did. As they build up these big data centers, in particular when you look at the massive players in that market, they tend to have very specific applications. And those applications tend to be massively parallel. ","Right, so if you think of things like search et cetera you can see how you could benefit from massively parallel solutions. And what sort of happens is for better or for worse, if you go to just making the CPU faster, the return there is not significant. And if you just go to multi-core CPU, there is a limit to what you can achieve there again without blowing the power and the blow [ph] out of the water or out of the data center. And so what has happened is the biggest limiter is power and the performance per power configuration that you get from an FPGA or programmable solution is superior for most of these applications. And the factor that we are seeing consistently is anywhere from 10 to 50. And it depends on what application, and exactly -- and it can change even between in the same company as they shift things around. ","So there, is if you believe, if you look at that then that implies that the traditional ability to address the customers' requirements through selling them faster CPUs or more parallel CPUs is limited. Hence the desire to have a programmable solution and the combination is very beneficial for what is becoming a very large path of the, what used to be a traditional server market. And that's best we can tell, that's what the customers are telling us, that's what they are excited about. ","We do believe that the Intel acquisition of Altera was driven by a desire to control that and to make sure that the roll out is driven and not in any way compromised by the CPU power requirements. And hence the rational for doing it and these same customers tend to have a very independent desire to control their destiny, which probably opens up opportunities for other non x86 architectures, for other players if there is a competitive x86 shown at the right point in time together with FPGAs. Now that maybe more than you asked. But that's the comprehensive answer.","Hans Mosesmann ","No, that was very good, exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Rolland with FBR and Company.","Christopher Rolland ","Hey, guys, thanks for the question. Just about the geographic breakdown, seems like you guys saw maybe a little bit of North American weakness but APAC was strong. And you guys are not the first ones to talk about this today. This is probably different than what we've been reading in the papers. I was wondering if maybe you had some sort of theory on why that might be and why there is a such difference in perception or reality.","Jon Olson","I don't know if I can comment on others as compared to us. I mean I can certainly comment on our business. I mean our strength in Asia Pacific was wireless business for us a little better China and then the India exposure that we had mentioned earlier, I think in answer to one of the question, those are really the bigger drivers there, with some wired business going on. Moshe talked about 5G prototyping, obviously the Chinese manufacturers are involved in that as well and as well as the other Asian manufacturers as well. ","So we have been participating in all that. So we've seen really good new product and new development product as well as some of the legacy LTE design that we have won become stronger. I would say industrial was solid or okay for us in Asia as well, but not knocking [ph] in other parts.","The North America phenomenon for us was really more about the aerospace and defense business declining than it was anything else. The decline was really driven mostly by the tail end of shipping of the joint strike fighter and the rest of our businesses there were good and in fact the large [ph] business was even up a little bit in North America as well. So I don't know if that help you at all Chris. But...","Christopher Rolland","Very helpful, thank you. Just as a follow up, you just mentioned India and Moshe mentioned it earlier, I think he has mentioned on the last call as well. Moshe, this time around you said that it was a smaller market. Obviously from a population standpoint they are just slightly behind China there. But how do we think about it here, are we thinking about India as fewer base stations or fewer FPGA content per base station when compared to, let's say a Chinese base station. What are the moving parts here and why is it so significantly smaller?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So sadly it is smaller because we believe that if you look at the Chinese approach they invest very heavily in infrastructure and they do it on a broad level, and they do it quickly and they try to make sure, maybe not at the same level you see in the Western world that there is good coverage. India culturally it's sort of incredibly cost focused, and the challenge that exist today in India is even though there is over a billion people there and it's definitely a large country, the problem is that there are a lot of carriers, probably far too many and I think very few if any of them are making any money. So the approach is to do the minimum, right? ","And as a result the deployments are likely to be in aggregate quite a bit smaller than what has been done in China. And that's -- it is what it is, maybe overtime it will improve but you go there it is a still a very poor country with a still small middle-class. And if you go to China you can see the infrastructure there is phenomenal and the middle-class there is much larger. And so I believe that that's the major driver for the difference between those two deployments. ","Jon Olson","From a content perspective, there is no significant content differences. I mean our anticipation is just gaited by our penetration in to certain manufacturers who have won the contracts for various carriers. So where we have more content at a given manufacturer then we'll -- and they win that the business in India then we'll participate. But there is nothing about the structural content of an Indian base station that's really different than any other rest of the world. ","Christopher Rolland","Great, thanks a lot. Thanks and good luck guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. ","Ambrish Srivastava","Hi, thank you Moshe and Jon. I had a question on the size of the business. You have laid out what seems to be a pretty realistic scenario. 4G is seems to be very long in the tooth or deep. And then 5G is way out there and I think Moshe you have been very consistent about the size and the timing of the server opportunity. So in the last three years where you had a big 4G opportunities in front of you which followed rather quickly after the 3G. So the question is and you also gaining share at 20 nanometer. ","So the question that I have is, is the business sized appropriately for a much lower build for the next two three years? Or do you look at what's going on in this space and look at M&A and say what maybe we need to think outside the box to grow and do something unconventional like EPLD companies sort of being affiliatory and you turn and say maybe there are some synergies that we can go after and be acquisitive. ","So just wanted your thoughts on that. And one real quick longer term, you haven't talked about autos. I know last year we had a conversation about A-Dash [ph] and how you compete with Mobileye. If you could expand on that that will be great. Thank you Moshe. ","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So maybe Jon can do the automotive one and then I'll give the very loaded or the answer to the very loaded questions you asked at the beginning. ","Jon Olson","Yeah, just at the high level on automotive business for this fiscal year we're expecting a 30% year-on-year, so full year FY '16 -- fiscal year '16 versus full year fiscal '15, we're expecting 30% growth in our automotive business. And that's based on from the product perspective it's based on penetration of Zynq into a variety of applications led by the advanced driver systems capability. Where we complete with Mobileye, by the way, we do we have other design wins that aren't Mobileye oriented. They could to be in radar, distance sensors things like that at the various different FPGAs in that. But relative to the direct completion with Mobileye it's around forward-looking cameras. ","So again our business is broader than forward-looking cameras but that's where we do go head on with Mobileye. Our strength has been in the dual or stereo cameras, where there is two cameras looking forward versus one mono camera, that's where we've got our original set hold. And we're very confident about our ability to compete with Mobileye across the broad set of platforms. ","Some of our customers actually believe they are competitors to Mobileye because they're doing the full solution and trying to win designs at a variety of platforms at various automobile manufacturers. So as we sit here today looking about this year's growth over last year and next year's growth and near after, we can articulate to ourselves pretty much every platform that we won in this regard and tend to see the kind of growth level that is potentially ahead of us again begin continuing this double digit growth on a go forward basis. Because we know we won these designs and the designs are very sticky for a multiple car year models. ","So with that I'll hand over the rest of it to Moshe. ","Moshe Gavrielov","Yeah now I'll try and respond to your very big question in a succinct way because otherwise we won\u2019t get home for dinner tonight but the my perspective and this is no longer in dispute is that the semiconductor world is going through a significant structural change and it\u2019s being driven by economics and as a result there is actually less and less players, I think that, that is no longer a bone of contention. You just need to count and see how much smaller it is. It\u2019s significantly smaller. There is fewer and fewer, to the point of almost none getting refresh through the venture world and the cost of moving forward from generation to generation is actually going up and there is fewer and fewer players who can do that.","So if you step back and look at that entire trend that clearly is an opportunity for companies who can move forward and we are one of those companies that\u2019s why we were first 28 with SMC first 20 with TSMC as a semiconductor player and that\u2019s why we got the 16 out way ahead of the competition. The reason that we do that is not just for bragging rights it\u2019s actually because once we have that leadership we can expand markets we address. If you look at what has happened to Xilinx over the past 10 years the role our devices play and generally the role FPGA devices play in a customer systems is changing. ","And as a result I will concede that the historic [indiscernible] logic FPGA market is not growing. But what is happening and you could argue that that is reason not to invest but what is growing is the SAM in terms of new markets we are addressing. If you sort of looked at our business you can see that even though this is not happening quite at the rate we had hoped we are displacing ASSPs. So if you look at the Zynq product offering that required new investment, a big investment but it\u2019s now starting to pay off these past two quarters both grew by around 40% and this is just the beginning. And that enables us to play in markets we have not played before. ","So that\u2019s the strategy we have. We believe that yes the results are not there in terms of the overall numbers but if you look at the change in the markets and the competition then actually there is an opportunity and in order to do that we are continuing to develop and be at the leading edge. Having said that, we can still do it and deliver profitability which was sort of in the higher echelon. ","So our strategy is to doing that because we believe that the opportunity is there the markets are developing and unfolding. And with just to take one example automotive was market which was very, very low single-digit percent for us and now is we expect for that to grow over the next few years. Industrial control, again another slow market is a market where we can displace a lot of solutions where in the past the customer would go to Freescale and TI et cetera to a large extent a lot of those historic players are no longer around.","So that\u2019s the strategy we have and part of that strategy requires us to continue to provide leadership also, it also requires us to invest heavily in tools so that our customers can exploit the opportunity that our silicon provides them. And that\u2019s an ongoing element and that\u2019s the strategy at this point in time. ","The challenge on the M&A side is that there is very few companies out there that we can buy that fit into our business model and actually augment our offering and hence you are right in pointing out that we haven\u2019t done much there. But I do believe the investments we are making while continuing to deliver best in class profitability will over the time enable us to continue to grow.","Rick Muscha","Operator we have time for one more caller.","Operator","And your last question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.","Harlan Sur","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So on the subject of new opportunities and the importance of tools on the Zynq and Zynq MPSoC product families which are in reality just full blown SoCs. I mean there is obviously a lot of software and firmware development, that's being tied to these programs. You've got your SDx development platform to kind of help to facilitate much of the software and the firmware development. So I guess the question is what's been the adoption curve of SDx, how important has the SDx portfolio been in terms of helping customers get into market faster and potentially capturing more design wins with the Zynq platform?","Moshe Gavrielov","Harlan, thanks for the question. So it has been very successful. There is tiers of products that we are providing, there is high levels interphase rate which is something we have had for close to five years and there is the SDx families of product that going out they have SD XL I believe has thousands of users at this point in time. SD SoC is starting to be used broadly. It's a big enabler to grow the population of users beyond the hardcore hardware FPGA designer. So it is essential and technology is doing well and the market deployment is doing well. ","The reason that the financial implications aren't yet visible in a big way is that the initial targets for those markets were industrial control and automotive and those two market move at the slower cadence. With the new generation we are actually expanding the number of markets we are addressing and we expect to see increased adoption of them. So yeah it is essential and it is something we need to do in order to displace ASSPs and to address the bigger SAM and so far in terms of technology and the deployment it's going according to plan.","Harlan Sur","Very helpful. Thanks Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Yeah, sure. Thank you.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today. We have a playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time, 8 PM Eastern Time today.

My name is Rachel and I will be your conference operator. I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and then we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information as currently available and actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It could be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. Fiscal 2014 was a year marked by the phenomenal success of our 28-nanometer products which exceeded $380 million in sales, easily surpassing our revised target of $350 million. For the company as a whole, fiscal year sales were a record $2.4 billion increasing 10% from the prior fiscal year and enabling Xilinx to gain PLD segment share for the third consecutive fiscal year. We also achieved a record gross margin of 68.8% in fiscal 2014, up from 66% in the prior year. Operating margin also improved markedly to 31.4%, up from 26.8% in the prior fiscal year.","Finally Xilinx continued to demonstrate a strong commitment to returning shareholder value through dividend increase and repurchase activity. We recently increased the quarterly dividend by $0.04 a share to $0.29 a share per quarter. In the fiscal year 2014, we paid a record $267 million in dividend and repurchased 5.2 million shares for $242 million. Additionally more favorable financial market conditions and a continued strong credit rating enabled Xilinx to issue $1 billion of senior notes using the proceeds to redeem our 2007 convertible notes.","Turning now, I would like to now turn to discussion of the March quarter. Xilinx sales were $618 million, up 5% and at the high end of our forecasted range. 28-nanometer sales increased over 40% sequentially driven by particularly strong wireless activity in China. Kintex remains the largest product at the 28-nanometer node but sales growth from Virtex and Artix were also particularly strong. Zynq sales also increased after more than doubling last quarter. Sales from communications and data center were stronger than anticipated in the March quarter, both wired and wireless sales increased during the quarter with wireless sales posting a new record and wired sales at its highest level in six quarters. China LTE deployments were the most significant factor contributing to the record wireless revenue, but we also saw growth in other geographies during the quarter.","Within wired communications, metro, access and data center applications were particularly strong. Virtex-7 design began to ramp during the quarter in area such as OTN access and SSDs. Infrastructure upgrades 100 gig and 400 gig and increased bandwidth requirements are driving many of these applications.","Test and measurement business increased as forecasted. However, industrial and A&D sales were weaker than anticipated due primarily to weakness from a couple of large customers in the industrial and security area, as well as a broad-based weakness across our smaller account.","Lastly, broadcast, consumer and automotive were down as forecasted related primarily to an expected decline in consumer business.","Gross margin was 67.6% for the quarter, 40 basis points lower than forecasted entirely driven by customer mix. Operating expenses were $228 million including amortization of $2.5 million, slightly higher than anticipated due to stock-based compensation associated with the higher stock price during the quarter.","In the March quarter we recorded a loss of approximately $10 million or $0.03 per diluted share associated with the redemption of our convertible debt. This one-time loss was related to the accounting treatment of the early call of the 2007 convertible notes. As a result of this loss, other income and expense was approximately $7 million higher than planned.","Net income for the quarter was $156 million or $0.53 per diluted share including a $0.03 per diluted share impact associated with the previously mentioned debt redemption loss. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $189 million before $14 million in CapEx during the quarter.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 295 million shares. This was 6 million shares more than forecasted due entirely to the impact of the higher stock price. There was a 21.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. The impact of the 2007 debt redemption will not be fully reflected in the diluted share count until Q1 of FY15.","For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com. We repurchased 1.4 million shares for $75 million during the quarter and 5.2 million shares for $242 million during the fiscal year.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $96 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion.","Inventory dollars at Xilinx increased by $27 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 115 days, up from a 114 days in the prior quarter. The growth in inventory is related to increasing safety stock on new products in anticipation of higher future demand. We expect inventory to increase again in Q1, FY15 as we anticipate strong demand for our new products in future quarters.","Let me now turn to the discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year \u201815. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up double-digit sequentially, driven primarily by a few large wireless customers in the channel business.","Coming off an exceptionally strong March quarter, we expect wireless to remain at these approximate record levels in the quarter, driven by continued China LTE activity. We also expect wired communications to be approximately flat as declines from a couple of large customers are offset by strength from enterprise, OTM and data center application.","We expect the industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be approximately flat with increases from ISM offset by a decrease in aerospace and defense.","Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be up, driven by increases from AVB and automotive. We expect the new products category to continue to grow. Mainstream products are expected to be approximately flat and base products are expected to decline.","As a result, we\u2019re expecting total sales to be up 0% to 4% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 50%. The lower than typical turns rate is driven by a strong beginning backlog from wireless and channel customers.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 68%. Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million, including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.","Other income and expense for the June quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 286 million shares. The lower share count reflects a reduction of 8.8 million shares associated with the redemption of the convertible. The tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be between 13% and 14%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Good afternoon to you, all. I am gratified that Xilinx delivered both record revenue and record gross margin in fiscal year 2014. 10% growth in annual sales was driven by almost [for true claim] of our 28-nanometer sales. These exceeded $380 million for the year [completely] surpassing, both our initial forecast of $250 million and our recently revised target of $350 million.","Similarly, our sequential growth in the March quarter was driven by exceptionally strong sales for our 28-nanometer product generation. This increased by more than 40% sequentially exceeding $140 million, both 40 and 28-nanometer product families achieved new record level. The growth was led by both our high performance Virtex-7 and our Kintex families with additional significant contribution from a high volume Artix-7 family from Zynq, the industry\u2019s first (inaudible).","Phenomenal success of our 28-nanometer product generation has enabled us to capture approximately 70% market share (inaudible) and grow our total PLD market share for the third consecutive fiscal year. In June quarter, we expect 28-nanometer sales to continue to grow driven by broad-based strength from all of end markets. We discussed at our Analyst Day in February, we have targeted 28-nanometer sales of over $700 million in fiscal year 2015. Our proven formula of success which has been undeniably delivered very broadly at 28-nanometer to ready yielding similar results to 20-nanometers with the UltraScale family. Again shipping functional sample of Kintex UltraScale the industry\u2019s first 20-nanometer [design] in November these functional devices based on key customer feedback are extending our time to market lead to at least six months.","Recently we have already both received and demonstrated functioning devices in-house for the first Virtex UltraScale product, this is the industry\u2019s only high end family offering of 20-nanometer. With $700 million of revenue projected for 28-nanometer combined with technology leadership with total execution already demonstrated at 20-nanometer fiscal year 2015 promises to be an exciting year with even more share gain in both 86 ASPs and (inaudible).","We now turn the call back to the operator for (inaudible) Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). The first question is from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","","Yes, good afternoon, guys and congratulations. Jon thanks for the color by end market for the June quarter expectations. I am just kind of curious relative to the China LTE build out do you think that this is a (inaudible) before reacceleration, is this sort of a peak level but a sustainable peak? And if you can help us understand what your level of business, what do you think that translates into quarterly base station deployments in China at current levels? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Yes, sure John. The -- it\u2019s a several points I\u2019d like to make about that. So clearly we had a really, really strong performance this quarter and this is driven by a very broad deployment by China Mobile, as well as the beginning of China Telecom deployments of the TDE LTE standard. And as best as we can tell I have a hard time giving you a quarterly deployment level, but we do believe that by the end of calendar \u201814 the China Mobile will have deployed upto 500,000 base stations in total at that point in time, so that\u2019s a 500,000 since the beginning of their deployment in calendar \u201813 middle of \u201813 going forward to get to 500 million, excuse me 500,000 base stations. And China Telecom will be somewhere between a 100,000 and 200,000 base stations by the end of \u201814. So, there is still a lot of work and deployment left to be done the rest of the year just on the TDE standard.","What hasn\u2019t kicked in yet, really is the FDD standard and right now our best estimate of that is for the second half of this year sometime and I do believe that that\u2019s an additive to the ramp that\u2019s going on, on the TDE area, so while I am always hesitant to forecast where peaks and plateaus are in the business that has this kind of variability. I think there still is a lot of positive trends left for us throughout this year and into next year with respect to rolling out those standards.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","And then John when you look at the OpEx guidance for the fiscal first quarter and compare that to what the guidance you guys gave for the fiscal year at the Analyst Day, it implies a relatively steep ramp. I am just kind of curious, is that a statement about your expectation for future revenue growth as the fiscal year unfolds or are there sort of fixed cost that come into the model that we should be thinking about.","Jon Olson","","There really are not any changes from what we\u2019ve said, at the Investor Day relative to our expectations on spending for the year or revenue or anything else quite frankly. We think we're on track to deliver what we\u2019ve said, the spending decline quarter-on-quarter really is more of a reflection of lower level of tape-outs in the June quarter than there were in March and that still be increasing as we go through the year, as we continue to more rapidly tape-out 20 nanometer now that we have the first two parts Kintex and Virtex taped out and well on their way to customers.","And we also have our annual focal activities, so salary increases going on beginning in the June quarter. So we expect to hit the numbers we\u2019ve said which were R&D between 530 and 550 and SG&A between 380 and 400 for the year those are our estimates. And so you will see an increase in the June quarter of spending over those two factors, the focal salary increases as well as the tape-outs increasing.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","","Perfect thanks guys.","Moshe Gavrielov","Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Jon Olson","","Hey Romit, are you there? I guess we should move on then.","","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Jon, how should we think about the gross margin trajectory this year? If communications continues to drive the growth should we be modeling gross margins closer to the 68% level or do you think it can get back to sort of closer to the 69% level as we go through the next couple of quarters.","Jon Olson","Yes, Vivek, we still are in the 68% to 70% range. We do believe gross margin will increase, gross margin percent will increase as we go through the year. What we're seeing right now is this disproportionate mix issue towards large customers and quite frankly towards the wireless business.","And as two things happen both cost reductions that are continuing to kick in as we go throughout the year and a mix as ISM and A&D customers are comeback throughout the year and some seasonal and some individual customers issues going on right now. Those comeback, we expect gross margins to increase from the current forecast of 68%, as we go throughout the year.","So, again nothing different than what we said on the Investor Day.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And maybe as a follow up for Moshe or Jon. You guys had a very strong year and fiscal \u201814 right growing double digit well ahead of your competitor. I'm wondering how much of that is share gain versus just the underlying PLD market sort of secular growth. And that I'm going with that as how should we just conceptually think about fiscal \u201815, is there anything that prevents you from going at a similar pace for fiscal \u201815 when you look at just the PLD initiative that you have spoken about and probably continued market share gains?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, if you think that we've projected 8% to 12%. We believe that when we have a virtuous product cycle as we clearly have now that enables us to shoot for the higher element at any point the compound growth is 8% to 12%. As we\u2019ve said before, we have now delivered it one time in a row and we are delighted with actually meeting that projection. And we\u2019re driving hard to continue, it\u2019s difficult for us to project what the rest of the companies in the area will do, but we feel very confident with our product offering.","Jon Olson","I\u2019ll just add one thing, we talked at the Investor Day and we have to talk about this for sometime our progress against ASSP and ASICs designs particularly in communication and we are now starting to see those contribute to revenue. So while share gains certainly contribute to our growth in 2014, I do think we\u2019re earning against our (inaudible) competitor. I do think that we\u2019ll continue to be able to grow the top-line as we penetrate some of those designs more fully from these alternative devices.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital","Thanks very much for taking my question. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Just first one to follow-up on the pace of China LTE rollout you\u2019re seeing. We\u2019ve kind heard some rumors that there may be some extra ordering from some of the related, some of the bills, I am just curious if you guys are seeing that dynamic at all?","Moshe Gavrielov","We don\u2019t really think we\u2019re seeing anything that would be in design of double ordering or whatever, and most of it\u2019s because we are the high valued part at the center of the universal radio [cards] in particular and then also on the baseband and backhaul. So we have really, really close logistics conversations with the primary OEMs there and we don\u2019t think there is a pattern going on.","We have talked about forecast variability, but they don\u2019t always know exactly how many base stations they need to deliver every quarter and then they order more or less in any given quarter. So, we are not really seeing anything I would say radically different in the short-term ordering patterns, meaning within the 60 to 90 day horizon that would lead us to believe that there is that kind of activity going on that you asked about.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital","That\u2019s great. Thanks very much. And then just as a quick follow-up your main competitor had an announcement out about their 14-nanometer efforts at Intel today, just wondering if you could tell us a little more about timing of 16-nanometer plus for you guys just kind of when you expect that to hit and remind us of your comments on I guess relative scale versus Intel 14-nanometer?","Moshe Gavrielov","","So, we are making tremendous progress with TSMC, we are delighted with their [16 FS] plus this has enhanced transistor performance and -- best transistor performance in that entire generation of products. So, we are working very closely with them. We believe that the combination of elements which we have is going back and in fact foundry is one element to that that the superior architecture socket software and the flawless execution that we have delivered -- we would like to continue to have leadership as we have demonstrated at 28 and 20. And so, we are continuing to make progress on 16 and there is no need for us to say more because at this point in time, we will deliver that technology as we\u2019ve predicted we expect to take out this year and to simplify it in 2015.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays Capital","Thank you very much guys.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird & Company. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Company","Hi, good afternoon. Given your commentary about the China mobile base station count by year-end, does that imply that orders will continue steadily for the second half of the calendar year that will decline as a percent of mix? And also how do we reconcile the backlog entering the quarter with the revenue guidance; do you expect a softening at the end of the quarter?","Jon Olson","So, the order pattern again will undoubtedly have some variability of course throughout the year. But we are expecting and I\u2019ll say the longer-term forecasting beyond a quarter from our large customers does show very solid numbers throughout the year. So, whether there is going to be growth every quarter or whatever, but the second half of the year does look reasonable to us vis-\u00e0-vis the first half. So, I think this is about deploying all these base stations been going silent this year doesn\u2019t appear that\u2019s the pattern if that\u2019s the underlying question you\u2019re asking.","And then reconciling the backlog I think is your question, because there was a little bit of a surprise to us relative to the channel more or so than the large wireless customers, because they certainly are trying to make sure that they give their fair share of our FPGA supply by placing orders earlier than they normally would have. So that is I would say the leading reason backlog is up so much. And so that is contributing to driving this lower turns number, but also the channel customers.","So, we had a softer industrial ISM business in the March quarter than anticipated. And so there was an inventory adjustment going on by some of our customers and they jumped in very quickly to order in and purchase more put more on the books early in the quarter. So I\u2019m not expecting a softer end of the quarter necessarily as a result of that backlog, it\u2019s really recognition because we have some specific classes of customers that put orders in the books earlier.","If you go back and then look at how do we look after the first few weeks, we\u2019re still more or less in a good backlog position. We are, but it is -- I do want to point out that some of the orders didn\u2019t come in earlier than they normally would have been in a given quarter.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Company","Okay. That\u2019s very useful. And then a quick follow-up, how should we compare the performance of Kintex-7 with Virtex-6? And in other words, is there really a performance incentive for OEMs to keep using Virtex as you make progress with (inaudible) node and the mid one product of (inaudible) node could be equal or exceed that of high-end of previous nodes?","Moshe Gavrielov","","Well, that\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s difficult to give one answer, but let me try to crack at it. As we move from generation to generation then typically the high-end of the previous generation is somewhat covered not totally covered by the mid range of the existing generation. And what you can get is similar performance at the attractive power level and in some cases the lower cost. So, generally speaking that trend does happen, but it\u2019s not a perfect replacement and it's not that you can take anything which would have done in a Virtex-6 and replace it with a Kintex-7. But it does tend to intrude and that trend from generation to generation does tend to repeat itself.","So, what use to be the most aggressive or the largest device in one generation tends to be competing against the mid range of the next generation generally, but not fully. And then if you look at two generation gap then for sure, you can see that the mid-range tends more than replace everything you had in the high-end of the previous one.","Jon Olson","I\u2019ll just add one more quick thing to that. So, we're winning in some of these ASSP opportunities in the wireless communication area, they need faster serial connectivity and more serial connectivity range and that\u2019s what we\u2019re being able to integrate, lots of capability into single devices or a couple of devices and that's all Virtex class capability that has been with Kintex. Kintex is designed to do so. We'd stretch the high-end to grow that available market. And so Virtex definitely has more life and is not being replaced for Kintex.","Moshe Gavrielov","So in order words, the [fan] of the high-end that expanded through replacing (inaudible) I think that\u2019s reporting point. So it's not -- it gets cannibalized and -- actually can grow significantly, it replaces different devices.","Rick Muscha","Next question please?","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Company","Thank you.","Operator","You next question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thank you very much. Jon and Moshe, we get so all of us are guilty I said we just get caught up in the 4G, can you help us understand what\u2019s the 3G business doing for you on a year-over-year basis or any guide post you could provide? And where I am coming from is that yes 4G is growing sounds like wireless especially China is doing well. But is it being offset to some extent by the decline in 3G and then I have a quick follow-up also?","Jon Olson","Well clearly, going from generation to generation as the 4G technology gets introduced to more and more geographies, there is a replacement effect that goes on naturally from 3G. But quite frankly, we still have a very, very healthy 3G business. Even in China, in addition to what\u2019s going on in 4G and clearly in Europe as GSM deployment and continuing to build out existing base stations for capacity reasons. And then broadly on a worldwide basis in those countries, they haven\u2019t started the deployment of 4G, we still have a very, very healthy business that is not related to 4G generation.","So, the answer to your question kind of depends, yes overtime it is replacing 3G, 4G to some extent, but these technologies tend to live on for a very long time and have a very long tail. So, it isn\u2019t just [foreign] replacement on a quarterly basis.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","So you don\u2019t have any metric for us in terms of what is (inaudible)?","Jon Olson","I don\u2019t really have that. I don\u2019t have that on my finger tips because we actually haven\u2019t looked at that, we look at it more on a customer basis and geographies, so I\u2019d have to dig into that a little bit, Ambrish.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s fair, Jon. And then my follow up is on the 20 and 16, can you just walk us though what are the expectations that you guys have because ASML came out and gave some conflicting comments about the potential delays from the foundry camp? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","","Well, you need to look at the public statements made by TSMC this week, they are all out there, they have the technology symposium, they do it once a year. They expect to have more than double-digit tape-out actually in 16-nanometer by the end of this year. And clearly 20-nanometer for them is growing at a faster rate than even 28 was and 28 was probably the most successful node they have ever seen. So TSMC is doing extremely well on 28, 20 and will undoubtedly be doing very well on 16 FF and 16 FF plus. So I don\u2019t know what the comments from ASML as they related to these current nodes but that clearly has, look at TSMC, they had a record year and they are projecting another significant growth year in calendar \u201814. So that highlights that at least the fabless companies TSMC has a majority of the fab business at advanced node doing really well.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets","Really Moshe, there was. And as I said there is some conflicting remarks, so thanks for your perspective. Thank you sir.","Moshe Gavrielov","","Sure, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks for taking my question. Moshe, I am wondering if you can give us an idea for when we might expect to see revenue for 20-nanometer products and when for 16?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, if you look at our Analyst Day which is two months ago and it\u2019s on the rear view, you can see that we showed that our current revenue at 28-nanometer is basically after to being 3 years in production and of course it was a very small number the first year, grew significantly second year and it has almost quadrupled the third year. And we would expect that same shaping happen of 20. And so it took about a year after the tape out to start to have any meaningful number on the revenue side and then it\u2019s 2 years before it gets to -- overall it has an impact on our overall revenue and then third year is when it sees the biggest growth and that\u2019s what you\u2019ve seen.","Now for us and if you look at the $140 million in the third year of production, that is just under 25% of our revenue. So that would be a good model and we think that model is likely to follow. 28 happened faster for us than previous nodes that is a good proxy. We\u2019d expect 20 and 16 to have similar trends in terms of their converting to revenue, rate conversion to revenue.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","That\u2019s helpful. And then one follow-up if I can, Moshe at the Analyst Day, you were asked about the sizing of 20 and 16, your anticipated size of that node from a revenue perspective overall. And I think your comment was that your view was that 20 plus 16 was likely to equal what 28 looks like overall. And first, if you could confirm that that\u2019s the view? And second, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about the last time that a new node wound up being smaller than the older node and if that\u2019s changing in new and different, why that might be?","Moshe Gavrielov","","Okay. So what you said, that reflects what we expect to happen. And the reason that it\u2019s happened this way is 20 and 16 are coming out very close. And there are some companies, business, (inaudible) if they\u2019re not early users then they just jump to the next node. And for us, because of the long design cycles and the long manufacturing cycle, those will co-exist, but because they\u2019re really about 1.5 years apart, [lead tape out] and the expectation was nodes would come at a lot more leisurely pace than they have in the past which that hasn\u2019t happened, we think that this will turnout the way that which we predicted, the two of them together will be as large as 28. And that\u2019s just because we're so close together. I don\u2019t expect future node to continue to come as fast furious as they have. If they do continue coming at this [cover], it\u2019s great and obviously the ROI changes need to be make sure if you don't double the amount to achieve the same amount of revenues.","And if you look at where we are, it\u2019s not quite that [street] does that, but it is a big investment and it\u2019s just due to the proximity of those to know nodes scheduled.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thank you very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jim Cavallo with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for taking the question. This is Gabriella Borges on behalf of Jim. I wanted to follow up on some of commentary on [comps and construction] beyond China. Could you talk about how demand is turning into some of other geographies, maybe in the U.S. Europe and Latin America. And any color on why you\u2019re expecting relative strength and\/or weakness over the next couple of quarters, would be helpful as well? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure Gabriela. The strength, we have broader strength, as I commented in my remarks about that. We did have broader geographic shipments and we saw strength, both in Europe and the U.S. And U.S. is still LTE deployments going on, just to remind you that Sprint and T-Mobile are still in their scale of deployment in rapid deployment.","We still believe that AT&T and Verizon are populating their existing base stations, they are not adding a new state base stations, I think Verizon is almost like at 95% or 98% covered where they had 3G already, but all the base stations are now fully [populated] for capacity reasons.","So, again we see a very healthy business coming out of North America still it\u2019s in our numbers and we do expect that will continue throughout this year. And we\u2019re also seeing in Europe continued expansion of GSM technology while they are beginning to do some trials and start to kick off additional spending with respect to LTE. So Deutsche Telekom in addition to Vodafone Deutsche Telekom also really has increased their capital spend forecast for the year, as they start to begin to look at their deployment of 4G technology in Europe and their locations. So all in all very healthy wireless business on a worldwide basis.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful, and thank you. And just as follow up on the weakness that you are seeing near term aerospace and defense, could you talk about how much of that maybe last time buy (inaudible) versus program timing over we can have some broader spending and also confidence with customers coming back later in the year? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Yeah, quite frankly most of our weakness is the guide of going down, I will talk more seasonal for us to someone is related to mainstream product that were in particular programs that were driven by our mainstream (inaudible) class of products more than it was anything to do with the historic older products that have gone off, again those will continue in a variability quarter-by-quarter throughout the year, but we actually had, see on a forward looking guide some normal seasonal patterns going on in the summer time and then in September and December quarters we expect increases in our space and defense again quite typically from a seasonal perspective. So as the government fiscal year ends, and the new year begins, we have typically seen dollars being flushed and new dollar new money coming in. We expect that same pattern to exist and we obviously have a number of programs identified where we believe those orders will be coming for us and we will ship against that.","Gabriela Borges - Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful, thanks very much.","Jon Olson","","Thank you. Next question.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Yes, first of all a clarification on this China FTD rollout in the second half, is that specific to China Unicom and what\u2019s the size of that deployment or it this more related to the China [5 mode] requirements for LTE going back and perhaps upgrading base stations.","Jon Olson","","This is a China Telecom and I suspect some Unicom will start, but it\u2019s really more China Telecom is the first leader on that in terms of the (inaudible). And so again we don\u2019t we have, I would say estimated forecast from our customers about when that might ramp, but we really don\u2019t have hard orders yet, so it\u2019s hard to know exactly in what time period they are going to ramp, our best estimate is during the second half of the calendar year.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Great. And my follow up and you gave a top supplier award to TSMC one thing you talked about is continuous yield improvement spending, just want to get a sense of how much yield improvement, gross margin tailwind is left here in helping to offset mix? Thanks.","Jon Olson","","Yes, sure. We are extremely happy with our overall yield improvement across all of our value partners, quite frankly it\u2019s really been an additive thing over the last several years to us. And in TSMC which has clearly the largest scale we have been able to ramp down costs very, very rapidly. We still are not at the lowest levels we expect to attain there, we still have a reasonable way to go. There are variety of other, things factors associated with yield improvement that really isn\u2019t just about just only about the fab, it\u2019s also about our test capability and being able to target the highest volume of the right speed of products [on] wafer for which is more of a sort of and final test capability that maximizes or optimizes this against the demand we have for those faster or slower kinds of products. And we\u2019ve made tremendous progress with our sort and test capabilities around isolating those kinds of capabilities in order to improve costs even more. So, it all was the wafer (inaudible) density is the biggest driver, there are many other things that we have on schedule that helps us reduce cost throughout the year. So we\u2019re still, we still have a lot of cost reduction left, what I am trying to say.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA Americas LLC. Your line is open.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey thanks for taking my question. This is Ryan Goodman in for Srini. Question on 20 nanometer, I know it\u2019s still a bit early but you announced the products shipping in another one around the corner. So maybe could you talk a little bit about which markets you expect this to gain traction in first? And maybe just a bit of a balance between how much is new market expansion with further ASIC, ASSP displacement versus more migrating your leading edge emulating type business in 28 nanometers to 20 and then eventually 16?","Moshe Gavrielov","So we have two families in 20 nanometers, there is Kintex and Virtex we actually have the only high-end family and the expectation is that that is an expansion play, it\u2019s largely for wired communications. The ASIC prototyping business, the high-end of middle arrow and generally the high-end of what our customers design, but it is an expansion play because the previous question was asked there, this enables us to affect ASIC and ASSP space. If you look at the Kintex product offering and we\u2019re sampling that broadly that process has been out for since November, we have been sampling it since November, so it\u2019s approaching six months I think at this point. That is [migrating] product which enables a cost reduction task and additional capabilities for the previous generation of Virtex products and it also enables an upgrade in regards to higher performance, the lower power to the previous generation of Kintex.","So this enables both, and if you look at the previous generation of Kintex is very broad amongst other markets, for wireless market, but it actually addresses a lot of applications and that mid range market is the biggest, the fastest growing, the largest here, but it\u2019s a fastest growing market and we expect it to continue growing at an accelerated break into address numerous markets, wireless being one, but that\u2019s just one of several that use those Kintex devices.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-on for Jon, just the inventory days I think you had mentioned reps to 115, it\u2019s a bit higher than you\u2019ve had in recent quarters and it sounds like you are looking to grow it again next quarter. Just can you help us understand what is the target range there, where are you comfortable on and how should that trend over the course of the year?","Jon Olson","","No, we're fairly above our target in terms of where we like to run the business from a long-term perspective and the target is there as a measure of efficiency. But quite frankly, you have to react to the environment around you. And when we have such a strong growth pattern going on in our new product category like we do now and growing revenue so rapidly, we want to make sure that we have the supply chain ability to supply our customers. And with the variability of the ordering patterns particularly from the China LTE business, we wanted to put a substantial safety stock.","And the good part or when you see inventory growing you might say there is warning sign there, but the good part of it is that\u2019s all in our new product, which mean to us there is no risk of obsolescence here, this is a matter of trading our cash for in the return on cash for inventory to make sure we have, we\u2019re well positioned.","We\u2019re far enough down on the defect density curve they are not buying expensive wafers and writing them off throughout the time period. So, this is kind of a no [brainer] from me and that making sure that we have that kind of capability.","We do expect this to continue meaning inventory will get larger in June and probably get in September and then start to decline as we go through the next several quarters. So again, we are establishing a higher revenue point for the company, inventory dollars go up, the days are kind of fluctuating around based on where our revenue is. So, I actually look at the total dollars of our inventory more than just a day. And I'm pretty comfortable into that we're in, which is in the neighborhood of 240ish plus or minus $240 million plus or minus.","Moshe Gavrielov","And the other reason is that capacity is tightening up and so it [beholds] us to make sure that we can seize the moment as these opportunities come. And this is actually public information with regards to capacity at 28 and 20. Most of them are doing extremely well and having the backlog in place and having the wafers definitely helps us address the opportunities.","Rick Muscha","Next question please?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Thanks guys, congratulations. On the new product category, it seems that 40-nanometer was flat or down, is that the second quarter in a row that\u2019s occurred? What\u2019s happening there in terms of the guide for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Jon Olson","Yes Hans, I don\u2019t think it was the second quarter in a row, I think we increased it in the previous quarter. So, it was down due to a couple of large customers who had taken products in the previous quarter and then was absorbing that inventory. We do expect new product category to grow next quarter and we expect it to grow both from 28 and 40-nanometer technology.","So, the peak of that generation is likely sometime this year maybe later in the year in total. That\u2019s what we can tell, although we still have a lot of very strong designs in the high-end of the business, the high volume part of our business; we expect it to continue to grow for at least in a year or two before a peak maybe even longer. Just to remind you that we\u2019re the only one in the industry that has that generation has high volume product and has serial technology with it et cetera. So, we are pretty happy with how things are going with that generation as well.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Okay. And then as a follow up, can you guys provide the mix Kintex as a percentage of 28-nanometer?","Jon Olson","","So now we are not providing that mix by technology, we did say it\u2019s the largest contributor to our total revenue last quarter. So, it\u2019s large but it isn\u2019t 50%. Okay, they are buried on Virtex-7 and Artix, Zynq as well.","Hans Mosesmann - Raymond James","Thanks again.","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley & Company. Your line is open.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley & Company","","Great, thank you. I wanted to explore just a little bit more the strong backlog kind of weaker turns, is that something, I mean are you seeing those weaker turns already or are you being, you sort of projecting that based on kind of the overall bookings trend that you have seen the lumpiness of the wireless business? And are you, is it possible with that conservatism in that number and the turns coming stronger or just how should we think about that?","Jon Olson","","Yes, it\u2019s again largely driven by these large wireless customers. We have seen this back in the 3G generation, the same kind of pattern. And so, I don\u2019t really feel like we have got some sort of a sandbag number but again with the variability that goes on with the Chine LTE, there are all possibilities that things are turned out different than we say. The second part of this story, the early backlog was around these channel customers specifically focused around ISM business. We\u2019ve done our best view at those customers where they are going to end up this quarter and that they just ordered earlier, the pattern was just a little earlier in the quarter than normally we would have seen things. So, it really isn\u2019t I think we are fairly positioned with our zero to 4 growth number.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley & Company","Okay, great. Thank you. And then in terms of the industrial aerospace and defense, you described some inventory kind of build and depletion around that, what would have triggered a build? I think you had some patents on couple of products, was it about that or was it just more customer behavior over the last couple of quarters?","Jon Olson","Yes. The question on that or the answer on that is really around the ISM A&D was because the programs didn\u2019t materialize as we thought and\/or there were some slips going on the A&D side that won\u2019t come back to still later in the year. But on the ISM side, it was a matter of leading out inventories. We\u2019ve had, very healthy industrial sales over the last previous six quarters and there was a bit of an adjustment going on at a few customers that we had anticipated some larger orders from. And we\u2019ve reconfirmed that they\u2019re ordering again this quarter. So, I am not too concerned about that at this point.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley & Company","Great. Thank you very much.","Jon Olson","Sure, Joe. Next question?","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ruben Roy with Piper Jaffray and Company. Your line is open.","Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Company","Thank you. Jon, just quickly, have you seen any appreciable changes in lead times over the last couple of quarters, 28-nanometer? And a follow-up question just around the 28- nanometer product Virtex-7. I think Jon you talked about some of the -- there is the ramp going on and some of the design wins around wired and markets outside of communications. Are you seeing design activity for Virtex-7 into wireless as well? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Yes. So on the lead times on 28-nanometer, our lead times again with our inventory build, we don\u2019t have any particular issue there, but as Moshe said, there is some general tightness going on in the 28 nanometer capacity. But if you look at our supply chain and backward to see if we have any lead issues, we really don\u2019t have anything significant there from our perspective. So I think not just from a wafer perspective but also assembly test and packages and things like that substrates, we\u2019re not seeing anything, I would say that\u2019s really significant in terms of any individual lead time issues.","With respect to the Virtex-7 ramp, I mean the applications are in the communication space are mostly on the wired side -- on the wireless side, we don\u2019t sale that much Virtex-7 into that. We have some Virtex-6 parts and Virtex-5 parts that we sent there, that we still ship into the wireless business. But the big growth for us from wireless has been Kintex. The Virtex-7 growth for us has been round wired communication and the applications associated with the network interface cards and 40, 100, 400 gig kind of connectivity capability. That\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the biggest single growth area. And then also on the solid state disc arrays for data center is both Virtex class products and in some cases Kintex.","Ruben Roy - Piper Jaffray & Company","","Great. Thanks, Jon.","Jon Olson","Sure Ruben. Next question?","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of John Vinh with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","John Vinh - Pacific Crest Securities","My question, as we roll into FDD deployments in the second half, can you talk about, are there any sort of differences in your competitive position on FDD-LTE versus TD-LTE? And also, are there also any sort of differences in content, (inaudible) content between of FDD and TD for you?","Jon Olson","","John, the FDD side, there is slightly more content for us on that but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like a 50% more or anything near that, there was slightly more contain on FDD. And from a competitive perspective, I would say most of the FDD is related to 28-nanometer. And as we have said before, we have an extremely strong design win percentage at 28-nanometer.","So, I would say there is no appreciable difference on the competitive environment for us. So maybe a little more dollar content and no appreciable competitive difference.","John Vinh - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. Thank you.","Jon Olson","There is last question now or...","Rick Muscha","Yes, we\u2019ll take our last question. Yes.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then we'll open the call for questions.","This quarter, we changed our revenue by product category classification. We make changes to these classifications periodically as products mature and new products are introduced, enabling the product categories to be more meaningful to investors. For comparative purposes, we have provided a supplemental schedule on our website at www.investor.xilinx.com that presents results based on both the new and old category classifications.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available, and that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon A. Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx's sales were $583 million in the June quarter, up 4% sequentially slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance. The quarter was characterized by strength in Asia-Pacific, particularly in communications applications, marginally better than anticipated shipments of last time buy inventory and expected weakness in North America driven by defense and industrial, scientific and medical. Turns were 55% for the quarter and relatively linear on a monthly basis. We continue to get the capacity we need from our foundry partners, and our lead times with few exceptions are within normal ranges.","Gross margin was 66%, at the high end of our forecast due primarily to continued new product yield improvement. Operating expenses of $220 million were in line with guidance resulting in an operating margin of 28.2%. New product sales were up 31% sequentially, with strong growth from our 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer families. Sales of our 28-nanometer products increased significantly during the quarter surpassing our target of $10 million. On a year-over-year basis, new products are up nearly 80% with most of this growth coming from our 40- and 45-nanometer product portfolios, which continue to gain momentum as designs ramp into volume production. Mainstream products increased 4% during the quarter, but are down 16% versus the same quarter of the prior fiscal year and base products declined 5% during the quarter, but are down 10% on a year-over-year basis.","Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. During the quarter, we modified our end market categories in 2 ways. First, we moved all data center customers into the communications category. And second, we renamed the categories to be more descriptive of the applications contained within each category, as well as more reflective of how we run the business.","The communications category will now become communications and data center. Sales from this category were particularly strong during the quarter increasing 8% sequentially driven by strong wired communication sales and double-digit sales to wireless applications.","The category that used to be called industrial and other will be now called industrial and aerospace and defense. This category decreased 5% sequentially with decreases from industrial, scientific and medical and aerospace and defense.","The consumer and automotive category has been renamed broadcast, consumer and automotive. Sales from this category increased 12% sequentially during the quarter driven by strength from audio\/video broadcast and automotive, while pure-play consumer applications were essentially flat.","Lastly, the data processing category, which has been a relatively small business for Xilinx over the last several years, was renamed other. This category will continue to contain applications such as high-performance computing, server and computer peripherals. Sales from this category increased 11% sequentially.","Net income for the quarter was $130 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Other income and expense, with a net expense of $9.7 million, higher than anticipated due primarily to lower than anticipated income from our investment portfolio and slightly higher interest expense associated with the accounting treatment of the convertible debt instruments.","Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $163 million before $8 million in CapEx. We paid $58 million in cash dividends during the quarter and repurchased 3.1 million shares for $99 million. The tax rate in the June quarter was 16%. Diluted shares for the quarter were 274 million shares. There was a 6 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with the convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $16 million to approximately $3.1 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $1.8 billion. Days sales outstanding increased 5 days in the June quarter to 40 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $12 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution together were at 99  days, down from 110 days in the prior quarter. We are now within our target of 90 to 100 days, but expect days to increase slightly in the September quarter.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter at Slide 13. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially, due in part to the completion of our last time buy program, which we expect to negatively impact us by approximately $25 million. This is a somewhat larger number than we had originally anticipated given greater than expected last time buy sales in the June quarter. Additionally, we believe macroeconomic uncertainty may result in unpredictable customer ordering patterns. That being said, we are expecting continuing growth from our new products as we continue to enjoy strong demand for products in all technology shipping in this category.","From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be down sequentially. Within communications, there will be certain pockets of growth such as wireless in North America and most data center applications. However, we expect these areas of growth to be offset by declines isolated to a couple of major end customers as they adjust internal inventories.","Within industrial and automotive -- excuse me, industrial and aerospace and defense, we expect defense and test and measurement to decline with ISM to be relatively stable. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to decline driven by consumer and automotive, with sales from broadcast expecting to increase. As a result, we're expecting total sales to be down 4% to down 8% sequentially with sales from all geographies decreasing.","The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 57%. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66% consistent with the June quarter. We continue to make progress on margin improvement projects across our product portfolio with particular emphasis on new product margin improvement. Operating expenses in the September quarter expected to be approximately flat at $220 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 274 million shares. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 16%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. While there continues to be uncertainty in the current economic environment, I'm very pleased with the sales increase of 4% in the June quarter. This growth was driven by double-digit increases in half of our secondary end markets.","New product sales were exceptional during the quarter, increasing more than 30% sequentially. This growth was driven by across-the-board strength from both our 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer, 45-nanometer product families indicating widespread customer adoption in all application segments. Particular sales from our 28-nanometer product family grew significantly in the June quarter exceeding our $10 million milestone. There is no question that we are realizing the advantages of our highly differentiated breakout portfolio that includes not only FPGAs, but also our pioneering all programmable 3D ICs and SoCs.","The growth in June was driven by significant increases in revenue shipments of Virtex-7 and Kintex-7 FPGAs, Virtex-7 3D ICs and Zynq SoC products. Our 28-nanometer product family rollout continues at an accelerated pace. Not only did we achieve a significant revenue milestone for the family through the announcement of the first shipments of our Artix-7 family FPGAs, we are now shipping members of the entire 28-nanometer family. The Artix-7 devices extend the reach of 28-nanometer FPGA technology to applications requiring low power, low-cost programmable devices with the highest performance in the industry by far for this category of device implemented in a small form factor. Artix-7 devices are securing design wins in a large number of applications, including portable, medical, handheld radio, small cellular base stations.","This past quarter, we also began shipping for revenue the Virtex-7 H580T FPGA. This is the industry's first 3D heterogeneous all programmable product. Virtex-7 HT devices use our stacked silicon interconnect technology to deliver the industry's highest bandwidth programmable devices, featuring up to 16 28-gigabit per second transceivers and 72 13.1-gigabit per second transceivers, making them the only single-chip solutions for addressing key 100-gig and 400-gig line card applications and functions.","With the April announcement of our Vivado Design Suite, we now have all 4 key elements of about 28-nanometer portfolio in the market. All programmable FPGAs, SoCs and 3D ICs coupled with the next-generation design environment enable these next generation devices. The customer acceptance of Vivado has been outstanding, with more than 200 beta customers designing with this new software suite, which provides up to a 4x productivity advantage and an improvement of 15% in terms of quality of results over previous generation development environments.","28-nanometer design win momentum continues at an unprecedented pace. We continue to see customers move away from ASICs through programmable imperative accelerated this node. The same time, we're integrating and displacing evermore ASSPs, as mid-tiered vendors struggle to fund and deliver on their next-generation devices, while our 28-nanometer portfolio is enabling a whole totally new level of programmable systems integration coupled with game changing price-performance per watt parameters.","Additionally, with our breakout 3D Virtex-7 ICs and our Zynq-7000 SoC products, we're penetrating markets and applications that traditionally were not served by FPGAs, and there is no PLD competition there yet. We have demonstrated indisputable leadership with our 28-nanometer portfolio. We have now shipped parts from all 5 of the 28-nanometer product families to hundreds of customers further demonstrating the very broad acceptance of the family. Having achieved the $10 million sales milestone in the June quarter, with sales expected to exceed $20 million in the September quarter, I'm confident that this 28-nanometer node will, by a very significant margin, be our most successful node ever. Despite some near-term concern in the macroeconomic environment, our clear 28-nanometer leadership puts us in a phenomenal competitive position that will enable continued share gains, against both ASICs, ASSPs and traditional PLD competitors.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","You talked about 5 out of the 10 submarkets being up this quarter. Can you talk about which end markets are sort of most or least below their prior peak in demand and given the guidance, are we done with inventory replenishment and restocking at this point?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, I'd say from a peak perspective Ian, this is Jon, I think from a peak perspective, wired is a little bit below the peak and ISM is a little bit below the peak. I think those are a couple that are, I would say, marginally softer, but slightly softer. And then the computing aspect of things has been down a little bit from its peak, but generally others have been up. I'd say so wired and wireless down a little bit, I didn't mention wireless, wireless has been down a little bit because obviously there was some bigger build-up when both China and U.S. we're going at the same time. So it comes down a little bit and then pure industrial down a little bit. And did you have a second part of that question, Ian, I'm sorry, I missed that.","Ian Ing - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just your sense as -- is inventory replenishment and restocking over at this point or if there's still...","Jon A. Olson","Yes. I may make some general comments about our posture and positioning here. And I think from an economic perspective, we really are seeing -- we aren't seeing anything really negative out in the market. I mean, orders have slowed, but yet cancellations and push outs have not increased. And my view here is there isn't any -- there is not significant build up of inventory in the overall in any of our end markets, with some exceptions in the communications segment. There are a couple of customers that I think have been procuring inventory a little bit ahead, and they're going to work through that in the next quarter or 2. I think that's the only place where we see anything. And that really isn't across the board, that's just at a couple of selected customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Furlong with Miller Tabak.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Just a follow up on that question, I'm wondering if you could kind of breakout, is it on the wireless or wireline side of this inventory piece, a few major customers that you have are building some inventory?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, it's wireline, primarily. Sometimes it's hard to tell because we do ship to some customers that have both wireless and wireline, but it is a little bit more wireline than it is wired.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","And then I guess the second question would be on the industrial side, which had a -- we just rebounded in the March quarter, I guess in the June quarter with some inventory refresh or replenishment to the cycle there, do you think that's now kind of a little bit completed or do you think there's any legs left in that part of the business?","Jon A. Olson","I think it's completed, and I think everyone's being really cautious about ordering. I wanted to emphasize our -- the fact that our lead times are in great shape on a relative basis so there -- my belief is that people are being a lot more cautious about stocking inventory, and they know they can get it in a relatively short amount of time. So if I go back to look at some of the other cycles we've gone into, we've seen push outs and cancellations increase ahead of the revenue drop, and we really aren't seeing that. So I think it's possible we've been cautious on our guidance for the coming quarter, but I do think we're going to be going through -- living through periods of up and down here as people make a decision on whether the economy is slowing down or not. Yet we still see CapEx spending very strong in the wireless area and even some wired initiatives going on in China. So it doesn't feel unhealthy to me. It's just feels like a lot of caution.","Brendan Oliver Furlong - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","And I'll sneak one last one if I could on the P&L. R&D was supposed to peak, I guess, in the September quarter, is that still the expectation, I mean, in the back half of the fiscal year we see some decline in the overall OpEx rate?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so total OpEx I believe will still be lower in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year. That being said, I think OpEx will move up a little bit from the $220 million in the December quarter, but then decline in December. So we're going to have a little more flat, instead of having a more pronounced peak like peak, it's going to be a little more flat than a decline.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So Moshe put out some 28-nanometer revenue targets, can you just give us a sense of how you expect 28-nanometer to ramp after this quarter and then if you could provide what the 40-, 45-nanometer revs were in the previous quarter and how you expect that to ramp as well?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, well, we aren't making any specific forecasts for this year, Chris, on 28-nanometer, but we do expect every quarter to increase on a going forward basis throughout the rest of this fiscal year. We're seeing very strong uptake from our customers even for samples, which is an extremely positive view relative to history on 28-nanometer. So we would expect increase. I know we're forecasting going from exceeding $10 million to exceeding $20 million and on a percentage basis, that's pretty good. I doubt that, that percentage increase will continue, but I do expect significant growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the rest of the year. And our 40 and 45, the whole new product, the new product category now is defined by being 28-nanometer and 40, 45 technology solely. So there's nothing else in there. So we grew overall new products over 30%, so 31%. And so I think you can probably do the math since we gave you the 28-nanometer number, you can figure it out pretty well.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And for my follow up, I guess a bit of a longer-term question, so if we look at your guidance for the September quarter and compare it with a year ago, revenues have bounced around, but it's roughly flat. And yet OpEx is up, I want to say like almost 15%. So can you just talk about your longer-term plans on how to get a little more leverage out of the model and to get the OpEx down towards your target and how do you feel about -- like the growth of the PLD industry and the growth of Xilinx these days?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so there's no question that we are spending ahead of the revenue growth level at this point in time and that's really primarily to leverage our leadership at 28-nanometer to make sure we get everything out as fast as we probably can and that speed and then the expense of the technology are driving that. And we've talked about in our long term revenue growth model of 8% to 12% growth. I mean, we need -- in order to get ourselves into model, we do need to grow at least at the 8% growth, and certainly the midpoint of that 8% to 10%, 5-year CAGR would put us in a position where we would comfortably be back in the model in my opinion. So we do need that, the top line growth in order to make that happen and to the extent that it happens, then our model holds, to the extent it doesn't happen, then we'd have to reevaluate, but we're not in that situation of thinking about reevaluation at this time.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","And we're confident that the strong position on 28-nanometer is what will drive that growth, hence the ongoing investment to make sure that we don't compromise that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Jon, can you just explain this last time buy issue demand? I'm not familiar with it. It looks like it's having a meaningful impact to your guidance in the quarter. Is it a problem that goes away after the September period?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, well, this is just the obsolescence of old technologies that after 12 to 14 years, we tell our customers that since volumes are relatively low we're not going to continue to ship small quantities and hold the manufacturing capability in our foundries beyond that, and we'd give them a long notice to say, better to tell us all of the units that you need and then take them, and we give you a last date that you have to actually receive them all. And so, this is basically a 2-year cycle that goes on, so every 2 years, we have this kind of process going on. And in this particular cycle from that technology, yes, we have had some elevation in the normal run rate for those products, which we've characterized as approximately $25 million impact in the September quarter. We will be shipping a very limited number of those products from those technologies on a go-forward basis. So yes, after -- starting in September, we won't be shipping very many of them.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then on North America infrastructure, it was an area of strength for you last quarter, and I think you guys are saying it's going to be up again this quarter. Considering that this market tends to be lumpy, are you at all concerned that maybe it fades as the year progresses?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so we're still very bullish about wireless. Our customer's customer serving North America, and we believe that even though if you just look at the CapEx spending between Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, at least Verizon and AT&T on a year-over-year basis, you said, while the CapEx spending really isn't going up that much why would Xilinx improve? Well, if you look inside of where they're spending their CapEx, they aren't spending on wired. They're spending more of it on wireless this year than they did last year. And so we're benefiting from their increased focus on 4G rollout in the U.S. And Sprint continues to be deploying as well and then T-Mobile in the second half of this year starts to kick in, in North America. So we are -- even though many of those units are shipped at different geographies for build and then shipped back into North America, we are still very positive on the rest of this year's impact with respect to our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO, Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Jon and Moshe, first, just a little bit more clarification on what I'm hearing from you guys versus what the customers are saying because on the wireline side it seems we have seen a parade of misses from the com equipment guys, and they have specifically called out North America spending slowing down, so you are saying that North America wireless is trying to think. Ericsson also talked about LTE becoming stronger going forward, but just reconciling that with what you were saying and more importantly, you mentioned that no \"alarm bells\" are going off and maybe you didn't use that word, but what then sets the alarm bells for you guys when you look at the order patterns, kind of what are the metrics that you look at and say, \"Uh oh, this is not what we were thinking,\" i.e. it's much worse than what we were initially thinking. And then my quick follow up was rather tied to what Chris was asking, interestingly enough, when you go down another node and we heard about multiple patterning and how that entails a higher cost, would that keep your OpEx higher as you go to the next node of  Virtex?","Jon A. Olson","Okay, so back on the comment on infrastructure business and particularly in North America that wire -- actually, wireline is a little softer. It will go down in the September quarter we believe and is wireless and that is the biggest issue positive issue for us. Wireline overall is, I'd say, stable in most places, down a little bit in North America and then down a little bit in Asia-Pacific. So it is kind of a mixed bag for us, it's a net down. But wireless, while wireless is -- went up quite a bit in the June quarter, a very healthy double-digit percentage, we think we'll be able to kind of hold that level, if you will, and there are these additional things that are happening with other carriers that we believe is going to give us some strength. So I know it's a little confusing because it's up some places, down some places, but we think we're in a really good position in this cycle with both, 65-, 40- and 28-nanometer technologies across the board winning designs at the key suppliers supporting LTE technology. Then your ordering pattern question. Yes, I know, there's all these things written in the paper, there's been a couple of companies that have come out and say things are softer in industrial, and they might miss their numbers and those kinds of things, and I respect that and that's why I think we've had a relatively cautious forecast, meaning down because we do think some things in industrial are going to be much more challenging. The data points that we look at are the rate of cancellations and push outs, the rate of orders, particularly when you're talking about industrial, how it shapes up from our distribution channel and what their forecasts are and what they're seeing, and we look at that by geography so we get a sense as to whether it's one geography or broad-based, a broad-based scenario. And it's entirely possible that we aren't seeing it yet and it's yet to come, but I also don't -- we talk to customers, we aren't getting the feeling that they're canceling their orders. And our backlog's down some, it's not down gigantic amount. So there's  a lot there that could push out and cancel if they wanted too. So we look at all those data points, we review all that weekly, and we've taken our best shot of what we think the quarter is even though I know there's all this macro uncertainty that you read about. And I try not to read the papers too much because it can get you depressed and try to use the data to guide the business. Then the third question's around node...","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Yes, why don't I take that? So definitely, 20-nanometer is going to be more difficult than 28 and similarly 28 was technically more challenging and more expensive on a per device basis than the 40-nanometer. And the way we are addressing it is we are being ever more diligent in making sure that the return on our engineering investment is there to support the level of investment. So generally speaking, I think that it should more or less remain at the same level, but we will be more careful with regards to tape-outs and we'll make sure that everyone counts as they become more expensive and more difficult and the design investment, it's incumbent upon us to make sure that the returns are there to support it. So generally speaking, our product planning is more meticulous at the 20-nanometer node than it has been at the 28-nanometer node and similarly at the 28-nanometer node was a lot more disciplined than it was of the previous node. It's one of the reasons that we believe we have actually hit the ball out of the park on the 28. The products were designed very well, and they're more or less getting that response from the customers. They're getting the right level of performance and power for each of the target markets, and we just need to be more diligent because you can't, if the design costs go up 2x or the market costs go up 2x, then you definitely can't afford to have the same number of tape-outs and hence we are being more careful and more meticulous about the planning process.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Ryan Carver in for John Pitzer. Just following up on that last comment, given the focus on the return of engineering investment on the allocation of engineering resources for future nodes, how does that coincide with your stated intent to be pursuing ASIC and ASSP sockets, which traditionally have a lower ASP? I mean, how do you balance this resourcing for future nodes towards the right efforts with also pursuing traditionally lower ASP sockets?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So that's a good observation, one doesn't preclude the other. We just need to be -- to the extent that we're targeting or replacing ASICs and ASSPs, which is happening en masse basically. Clearly, much faster on the ASIC front than on the ASSP front, but its happening on both of those areas. You just need to make sure that the devices you do come out with are targeted to compete effectively and have the right performance and power and set of features that the customers need. So it's incumbent upon us to do that. Having said all of that, you need to realize that these same parameters apply to the ASSP and the very, very, very few companies that are still pursuing ASICs and typically only for extremely high volume consumer-type application. And their design costs are going up, so they can't continue to blanket the earth and start designs willy nilly, and they're not. And what we're seeing is an ongoing accelerated transition where less and less companies are pursuing those angles on the ASICs front and on the ASSP front to be very well documented that the companies that are moving forward, are moving forward very aggressively, and we are one of those who strive to be at the leading edge, but more and more are holding back and saying, \"Well, we'll design at the new nodes 2 to 5 years from now because we can't afford it anymore, and at that point in time the market costs will go down and the yields will be at their peak, et cetera, and we'll be able to make the financials work.\" But at that point in time, we will, if we continue to move forward, we'll have a big advantage versus those companies that are holding back and that is part of the programmable imperative and it continues at least at this point basically unimpaired and full steam ahead.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just sort of going back into the coms business. If you look back to the Q1 timeframe, I mean, you guys were up sequentially in coms, where your comp was sort of down 20%, and it seemed to be a pretty big gap in similar sectors, albeit, different geographical mixes and now you guys are talking about sort of a down September quarter on large customer inventory burn down. So I'm just curious, how much of the strength in the Q1 and the Q2 timeframe calendar-wise was attributable to perhaps pull-ins versus sort of organic demand?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, I don't think there's any impact on any pull-ins to any large degree. We did call out, there was a couple of customers that built -- that has some inventory issues that we believe they built ahead. But on a broad-base, there really wasn't an exacerbated calendar Q1 or calendar Q2 impact from any of that. We were participating in a recovery in the March quarter in a very large way as customers very broadly across all of our end markets replenished their inventory, and I think we've had more, say, typical growth out of an inventory cycle.  I'd say it's very typical for us that you'd have to ask a competitor about their particular profile and issues.","Ryan Carver - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. One last if I could, on 28-nanometer relative to March quarter expectations for the growth, I mean, how does that growth trajectory look? And I guess what I'm thinking about is, given early in the year commentary that 28-nanometer would be sold out through the balance of the year, how has your 28-nanometer trended relative to what you had perhaps told your foundry partners at the beginning of the year and are there any issues in terms of needing more product that they be can potentially supply or being forced to take more product than you actually need?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, we projected some time ago that when we'd hit $10 million this quarter, and we're delighted to have done that, and that's in line with our plans. For several quarters, we expected this to be a $10 million quarter. And similarly, we're looking at the $20 million mark and for the quarter we are in, the September quarter and as Jon alluded to, we expect growth, and it could be significant growth through the rest of our fiscal year because this is a rocket ship, and it's one of those things which when it takes off, given the nature of our business, it doesn't turn on immediately, it starts layering. And we're seeing an acceleration, which is the fastest we've seen, which we strongly believe is a function of the technology position we have and the breadth and depth of our product offering, plus the very significant advantage this gives over the previous generation of product in terms of much lower power and much higher level of -- much higher density or gate count. So fundamentally, the product offering is very strong. We're seeing that translate into design wins. Now design wins, those are very big numbers, they're in the billions of dollars at this point, but what really matters is revenue and that's the number we're fixated on, and that's the number that really matters. And we feel very comfortable in our fab partner, TSMC, at 28-nanometer being able to cover for us, and you need to keep in mind that these are great numbers for us, but these are still small numbers in terms of wafer volume for a large fab like TSMC. So they have the capacity to address this, and we do not see any issues either this year or to be honest next year in terms of meeting our demands.","Jon A. Olson","Nor do we have any deals, any relationship that forces us to take a certain amount of wafers out. You made some comment that I didn't really -- maybe I had misinterpreted, but that's not how our relationship works where we're required to take it. So I wasn't 100% sure where you were going. First it was sold out. You said it was sold out, implying that we didn't -- we couldn't get capacity. Well, we have what we need to meet our revenue needs, and I guess that's all I'll say about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Moshe, first of all, congratulations on the progress you've made on 28-nanometers. Can you give me, is it possible for you to provide some color as to the relative strength of this business across the 3 segments you mentioned, the stacked silicon and the high end product content so that I can just kind of get a sense of where the strength is coming from,  why is it different across the board.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. So no, we have 5 general product families and 2 of the 5 are unique, and they are product families that we pioneered, and we believe we have huge as in a year or more and potentially could be significantly more lead over the competition. Those 2 product families are SSIT, the 3D stacked silicon; and the Zynq product line. The Zynq product line is still, in terms of number of units shipped, it's quite significant, but it's a small ASP. The stacked silicon tends to be a smaller number of units, but it's quite significant for devices of that complexity, and it is a significant part of the revenue that we have shipped. In addition, when you look at the 3 other product families which are the mainstream ones, which is the mainstream Virtex-7. That is basically doing extremely well, is ahead of plan and given that it has a significant power advantage over the competing products, plus we actually have higher overall bandwidth going in and out of those devices. We're seeing a tremendous level of design wins, which is starting to translate to revenues. But that's not yet huge as part of the $10 million number. So the largest components of the number are the SSIT and actually the Kintex product offering. But very shortly, we expect the Virtex to translate into a significant number and actually if you look at the overall Virtex family it will be the majority of the revenue at the node will be the Virtex and the SSIT, which is the high end of the Virtex. And then the Zynq is sort of an expansion play, which is on schedule and we already have in our mind a year at a minimum of lead over the competition and that is starting to move into volume production in the foreseeable future. So it will be a major part of our revenue coming soon, but it will be less than either Virtex or Kintex as a stand-alone. Artix, we have sampled the product and that tends to be the low end so in terms of the overall percentage of the revenue that will likely be the smallest of the --","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Of the mix?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Of them all. Hopefully, that answers your question.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It does. It does. Let me just ask you a difficult question, part of the strategy to drive growth is to retake share in the 40-nanometer category, and you've grown that over just -- in the quarter that just ended. Any way for us to calibrate your progress and if we have any sense as to where your share was and where you like it'd to catch so that we know how to calibrate that, that would be helpful.","Jon A. Olson","Jon could just...","Jon A. Olson","Let me try that. So quarterly share is really dependent on customer mix and things like that relative to us versus our competitor, and so when I did the Analyst Day, as you may recall I talked about the fact that in calendar year '11, we had 35% share at that node, and we felt on a run-rate basis over the next several years it was going to move up to 50%. Last quarter, I'll say the March quarter, make sure we're in the right quarter, March quarter we estimated to be in the low to mid-40% because we shipped quite a bit, our competitor didn't ship as much. This quarter, I don't know what this quarter is going to be, but we had very significant growth, as we said, we had over 30% growth of new products and the overweighting dollar value of our new products happen to be in 40-, 45-nanometer because we're still very fresh with the 28-nanometer, $10 million or so. And so we had a very, very strong growth of 40-, 45-nanometer so we're very happy with where we are in terms of these key designs that are moving into production and starting to take volume. And I think because we've modified our new products to be only 2 technologies now, it's going to be easier for you guys to figure out what the growth  numbers are, good, bad or different at any given quarter as we provide that data and information.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. That's helpful. And just one last question please, if I may. Moshe, can you just provide a bit more insight as to what's going on within China, ZTE, which is one of your customers, preannounced recently I think on Sunday night and that if I think about the various phases of events within China, it's something a little difficult to kind of get a clear view. So any sense as to how you see the China coms business developing and the road you expect to play in that will just be my last question.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, China's been a focus area for us, and it clearly was a smaller business for us than it was for our primary competitor, and I think part of that was due to a geographic focus and part of it was due to product focus. And I have no doubt that the Chinese companies and the 2 biggest ones are very well known are going to do very well in the communications business, and we feel that we have by far, the best product offering which addresses their requirements. So we don't know who the winners are going to be, but in terms of percentage of business for us in China, it should be much higher than it has been in the past and that will be driven by 28-nanometer. And it's already manifesting itself in terms of design wins and actually significant parts of the $10 million was shipped into China. So best we can tell that's going in the right direction for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you talk about the -- what you see in terms of small cell in terms of FPGA content? How meaningful that could be later in the year and whether we should be concerned on second generation of those small cell that there could be some migration back into ASIC or you think that FPGA has a very solid position in those new products or new class of products?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So what is becoming clearer is that they are going to be heterogeneous networks, which have a mix of macro cells and small cells and when we talk to our key customers in this area, we're hearing more and more that they expect that to be the norm, and it isn't going to be one replacing the other, but both of those will need to coexist, and they expect their end customers to deploy networks, which has a mix of those. And so as such, we are continuing to see a big investment in wireless base station infrastructure buildup which uses FPGAs. In those cases we actually see that the FPGA is becoming a larger portion of the bill of materials as our customers painstakingly point out to us every time there's a negotiation. And so generally speaking, we're addressing what is a larger market. Portions of it will definitely be addressed by small cells and those might be either done as ASICs or there's a whole host of ASSP companies that are probably overpopulating that arena and hoping that it will grow at a large rate. We expect those to coexist and we actually play in some of those markets with our products, but it's not in the high-volume consumerish places. It's in -- for a larger number of users that's where FPGAs are used to implement that. So this announcement on the death of macro cells is, and I'm paraphrasing, very premature at this point in time and everything we hear from our customers implies that they're going to be deploying massive amounts of macro cells in the future, both short, medium and long term, and it's not a one technology obviates the need for the other, they both will coexist.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, we're actively designing for some concept with FPGAs as a player in certain categories, in certain numbers of users of the cells -- of small cells, which if you get more educated, everybody's got their own version of a small, medium and large, but we believe we can participate in the medium-sized and the larger sized small cells if you want to get to be real basic in that. So we do think that we are -- we do believe it's going to grow and that category is going to grow, and we think we have a play in them as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about on the wireless side, some of the geographical trends you're seeing and you expect over the next couple of quarters there's been a lot of mixed data points about what's happening in India and China and in other geographies including Europe. Can you maybe talk about what kind of deployments you're expecting? Do you think those are slowing down or you see them as largely unchanged in the end of the year?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so let me take that one, Jim. Over the next 2 to 3 quarters, I think there's a bigger opportunity for carrier spending first in North America then in Europe and then maybe third in China, and then India would be last. And I know Europe might sound odd, but some of our data points seem to indicate that there is a need to have more CapEx and to start to upgrade the network, which is starting not to keep up in some of the suppliers in particularly they have not even really touched the LTE technology at this point in time and there are carriers that are now making the call to invest even in the face of -- for their biggest macroeconomic uncertainty is, which is in Europe. So if those actually -- if they really go forward with that, I think that will be a very positive thing for us as well. I've talked a lot about North America and how strong it is with all the major carriers here making investments. Even Russia, for example, we believe there's a big play going on in Russia to start to roll LTE and again that's a very positive thing relative to the customers where we are. China seems to be the biggest potential consumer, but not a whole lot of movement going on about when things really happen, and when things are going to take off. And then India, I have no new information on India, just seems to still be uncertain of when it's going to happen.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful color. And then maybe as a follow up, normally in the December quarter, your defense business is up rather strongly based on the visibility you see in products today and how you think that's going to shape up, do you still think that's going to be the case this December quarter or do you think there is a potential that the fiscal issues could -- and the budgetary issues could have an impact on that this year?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, there's always an issue. There's always a chance that the fiscal issues could have some impact. But typically, it's more the volume or our revenue is typically projects that are well in flight somewhere and sometimes that can be impacted by the short term freezes and things like that, in other times not. I would still expect a better December in aerospace and defense than in September. That's my expectation, but I have to admit I have not looked at it on a customer-by-customer basis yet. We're saying we're down at September versus June, and I would -- my expectation is that we would be up again in December in that category.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a question on the magnitude of your guidance by segment, about 4 out of your down 6 points in your overall guidance is coming from the last time buys, if we take that out of the equation, you talked about your main end market categories, can you give us an idea of the magnitude of how you believe those would perform? Kind of what would be best, what would be worse, et cetera?","Jon A. Olson","Parsing out pieces of our revenue and not having a way to explain it to you on an equal basis is actually a little dangerous thing for me to do. I don't think I'm going to give non-GAAP information about our end markets that we publish on our filings and things like that by taking certain things out. I will -- I can tell you that, that last time buy has impacted several -- we ship things to several end markets, but industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense and some communications and kind of in that order. Those are the ones that were impacted the most by it. So you might imply from that, that oh, since industrial is going to be kind of flat, not counting aerospace and defense, then gee if you didn't have last time buy maybe it would have been up a little bit. So I'm not trying to be difficult, but I don't really think I want to get into non-GAAP analysis.","Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then one that might be a little bit straightforward, I guess, just a clarification of an earlier comment you made, Jon, on the OpEx trajectory for the rest of the fiscal year. Just to make sure I have the fiscal and the calendar quarters right, did you say that the December quarter OpEx would actually be up a little and then the bigger fall off to get the back half down year over or half over half would be in March or was it actually going to be down in the December quarter as well?","Jon A. Olson","It's what you said first, it will be up, it's going to be up a little bit in December quarter and then down in March.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess first question just a point to clarify. In terms of end of life, what was the sequential downtick in September that's negatively impacting your guidance?","Jon A. Olson","$25 million. Okay, we'll ship $25 million less of that category of inventory in September then we did in June.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that will fully be resolved end of September and should not impact revenues going into the December quarter or will there be a sale?","Jon A. Olson","Correct. The tail is really, really small. So essentially it's -- that's it. Now we're done with that, with that technology.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Excellent. And then I guess a question on 28 and thank you for the great color there in terms of what's driving the growth in the mix there. And I guess my question is on the stacked silicon side, can you talk about what the kind of growth trajectory looks like there, my understanding is that emulation is the biggest driver for you guys, and I guess curious what the sustainability of growth looks like and how we should think about that part of the business exiting calendar '12 and moving into calendar '13?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So you're right in highlighting that emulation is a driver, but it's not the only driver and so if you look at who would use stacked silicon, you need to look at the -- what it provides customers and basically provides the customers with higher capacity and higher bandwidth than they can achieve any other way. And to some extent, it generates a market in of itself because the only other way to achieve this would be to design a hideously expensive ASIC and in some cases, even if they went to the most advanced process node then they would need to design for these to achieve these high frequencies, which is in of itself a very significant challenge. So clearly, the people who use it first are ASIC prototyping, but actually then it moves into other areas, which are wired communications, test and measurement and actually A&D, and it's all in the high end of those markets. So this is not a one quarter wonder and then the whole thing goes away. It does not really go away until there's an alternative, which if you use traditional forms at the very earliest, is available at the next process node, and it's available at the next process node only when the largest chips are available at the next process node, which typically take some time to get there. So you can count on this having a significant vibrant life and emulation are the early swallows, but then full-fledged spring starts with all of the other applications that use it, and it should have a 3-year life cycle just driven by the fact there is no other alternative. And as such we are very pleased with the opportunities it opens us.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's very helpful. If I could just sneak one last question in. Jon, what is -- and I know it's hard to calculate because nothing's normal these days, but what is typical seasonality for Q3?","Jon A. Olson","Q3 calendar, Q3 fiscal, trying to make sure it's September.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Calendar.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, September quarter. As you look back at our history, it's been up a little. So pretty flat and of course the standard deviation is actually pretty broad. We've had some times where we've been down a whole lot and up a whole lot, but if you look at averages over the last 5 years or 10 years, it's really in the neighborhood of kind of a plus or minus 2% range.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today.

It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations Web site.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. Profitability remained strong during the quarter, but sales were lower than anticipated declining 2% during the December quarter. The primary weakness was driven by broadcast and wireless communications end-markets. 28-nanometer sales represented one of the bright spots of the quarter with sales increasing nearly 20% sequentially. All members of this product family grew with Zynq, Virtex and Artix all posting double-digit growth rates. From an end-market perspective, sales to communications customers declined 3% sequentially with flat wired sales and a decline in wireless sales.","Wireless sales were impacted by weaker sales from non-China regions, while our China wireless business increased in line with expectations. Industrial and aerospace and defense sales increased as expected with strong defense sales offsetting declines in industrial, scientific and medical. Broadcast, consumer and automotive sales declined due to weaker broadcast sales, which were driven by weak purchasing activity from a couple of large customers. Automotive sales were better than expected as several new advanced driver assistance programs began to ramp. In terms of linearity, the month of October and November were in line with our expectations and the month of December progressively weakened. Turns were 44% for the quarter.","Gross margin of 69.7% was better than expected as a result of customer and product mix. Total operating expenses were $224 million, including $2 million of amortization related expenses. This was $6 million lower than guided resulting in operating income of 32%. Other income and expense was a net expense of $4 million better than forecasted, mainly due to higher interest income from our investment portfolio. Net income for the quarter was $168 million or $0.62 per share including a $0.02 per diluted share benefit primarily related to the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","Operating cash flow for the September quarter -- excuse me the December quarter was $291 million before $6 million in CapEx. Strong cash flow during the quarter was positively impacted by a net improvement in working capital led by the timing impact of accounts receivable. Diluted shares for the quarter were 274 million shares. This was a bit higher than forecasted as a result of the higher stock price. There was a 7.8 million share dilutive effect from our convertible note. We are committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we continued to aggressively buyback stock through purchasing 4 million shares for $175 million. We also paid $76 million in quarterly dividends. For the fiscal year thus far, we have returned over $700 million to shareholders in the form of repurchase and dividend, $80 million more than we generated in operating cash flow.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $28 million to approximately 3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in the net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars decreased by $16 million during the quarter, we plan to continue to reduce inventory dollars in the March quarter.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the March quarter of fiscal year '15. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Although we are forecasting another strong quarter for our 28-nanometer products, we will be facing headwinds from aerospace and defense due to a normal seasonality and program-related timing. We expect both wired and wireless communications to be flat sequentially. Wireless sales will be impacted by the timing of the FDD-LTE deployments. We expect industrial and aerospace and defense segment to decrease for the reasons I mentioned earlier, offsetting flat sales to ISM and test and measurement.","Broadcast, automotive and consumer is expected to up driven by a rebound in broadcast and continued advanced driver assistance strength in automotive. As a result, we\u2019re expecting total sales for the March quarter to be down 2% to 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 51%. Gross margin is expected to be 68% to 69%. Operating expenses in the March quarter expected to be approximately $227 million including 2.5 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. Other income and expense for the March quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million and the share count is expected to be approximately 270 million shares. The tax rate for the March quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.","Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. I am clearly disappointed with our top-line performance, both during the December quarter and the guidance for the March quarter. Looking forward into fiscal year 2016, we are planning for a flat to low growth environment. The renewed revenue growth from our 28-nanometer portfolio will be somewhat offset by uncertainty in global communication spending and expected declines in key aerospace and defense programs.","On the positive side, Xilinx posted strong profitability in the December quarter, both gross margin and operating margin at 69.7% and 32% respectively were better than our expectation contributing to earnings per share of $0.62. Our cash flow continues to be healthy and we are on a path to return more cash to shareholders in the form of both dividends and buybacks that we will generate in fiscal year '15. The most significant highlight for the quarter is our renewed 28-nanometer revenue growth, which exceeded $150 million sequential increase of nearly 20%. We\u2019re anticipating 28-nanometer sales to continue to grow and exceed $160 million in the March quarter.","We also achieved several important milestones for our 20-nanometer portfolio. Our Kintex UltraScale devices became the industry's first 20-nanometer FPGAs to move into volume production. Based on customer feedback, we continue to believe that we have an estimated one-year lead over the competition. This technology leadership is complemented by our Virtex UltraScale family, which is the industry\u2019s ASIC class 20-nanometer high-end product offering. It's a very high-end of this family, we began shipping the industry\u2019s largest FPGA which delivers over 4x of the capacity of any competitive devices.","Finally in the area of design software, we launched the SDAccel development environment. This is the second in a family of software defined development environment, which we call SDX and this will greatly expand our user base to include the broad community of systems and software engineers from both existing and new markets. This environment combines OpenCL, C and C++ languages with an initial focus on the growing data-center acceleration market.","Despite the top-line challenges, I remain confident in Xilinx\u2019s strong technology leadership and market position. We\u2019re still in early phases of 28-nanometer revenue growth, have already delivered the first production ASIC class 20-nanometer product, market expanding new SDX software defined programming environments and soon our 60-nanometer products that include multi-processing SOCs. At our Investor Day on March 10th, we look forward to providing you more details outlining our plans.","I\u2019d like to turn the call back to the operator for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ross Seymore","Moshe, I just wanted to get a little more color, if you could, on your statement about, I think you said fiscal '16 being a flat to low growth environment. Can you give us, again, a little more detail on the puts and takes that lead you to that conclusion? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, we\u2019ll be giving more details in March, but fundamentally growth is driven for us by 28-nanometer and we see clouds from communications and A&D. And so when you look at the combination of both of those and we see it as being generally speaking flat to a low growth environment for fiscal year '16 that\u2019s probably as much as we can say at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Stein of SunTrust. Your line is open.","William Stein","Also on growth, in the past, Moshe, I think you've talked about growing at some multiple, I believe it was two times the semi industry. We're not seeing that now and you're certainly setting more moderate expectations for fiscal '16. Should we think about this is as a more sort of permanent reset to the longer-term growth potential that the Company has? Or do you think this is a sort of soft-spot that we will power through eventually and return to more meaningful growth?","Moshe Gavrielov","The comparison with the rest of the semiconductor industry is a very difficult one to make, because it has so many elements and sometimes there\u2019s fast growing applications like mobile, so that\u2019s not ours. But definitely we do see things slowing down. I think we will shed more light on this in March and also be able to forecast the -- more accurately the period that this will continue, but this is -- I would look at it as not a global statement at this point in time and we\u2019ll be in a better position to answer it in March.","Jon Olson","Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re making a long-term statement on that Will and I think I\u2019d just like to highlight the headwinds from aerospace and defense which are in some cases program related that are causing some of the headwinds for FY16 and we still have a good strong long-term view of our aerospace and defense participation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.","Alex Gauna","I\u2019m wondering, as you look at your aerospace and defense business, how much of this is a result of the Russian sanctions? Do you have visibility on how long these delays might last? And is there any effect from the strong dollar factoring into either this category or even in the communications segment? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Yes so from a Russia perspective, no, and aerospace and defense not really I mean we -- some of our communications business and some of our high performance compute which is in the other category in particular that latter statement, we\u2019ve had some impact because of the Russian sanctions and that\u2019s been difficult for us to ship certain things into Russia and to get licenses for, so that has had some impact. But I would say it\u2019s been relatively small impact, but certainly anything helps right in this kind of environment, so we\u2019ve had some impacts from that. Relative to the stronger dollar, since we ship everything in U.S. dollars we don\u2019t have an actual direct hedging effect, but obviously our customers\u2019 customer and distributor does ship in local currencies and that while when we\u2019ve asked those questions, we haven\u2019t gotten any answer that says yes it\u2019s really impacting our business. I know of other businesses that are saying that to me that they\u2019re having some issues, because effectively relative to the euro our products have gotten 20% more expensive over the last year or so. So it undoubtedly is going to have an impact to what I would call already a weaker environment in Europe than most other places.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","Yes, my one question is in the China base station business still some big targets for base station deployments this year among the carriers. Do you expect any of the same sort of bomb kit issues you had last year supply constraints in RF power amps from other suppliers?","Jon Olson","Yes so the -- from the power amp perspective I think there are still some other shortages that are going on, but that\u2019s really not the biggest gaining factor to our overall wireless business that\u2019s for sure. And I think with specifically in China there\u2019s probably two changes to what we have been thinking and saying about it. One is the phase 3 rollout, while it is, and we still believe it is beginning in the spring time and that\u2019s progressing. The pace of that rollout seems to be a little slower than the previous two phases where in the past we\u2019ve seen a pretty high concentration over a quarter and a half of deployment and that deployment seems to be at least best as we can tell maybe lasting a little longer to get those base stations out, so a little bit longer time period. And the second thing which is also looming on our minds is around the FD licenses. I think I\u2019d articulated that the FD base stations would start to ship in this March quarter and then throughout the remainder of calendar '15. Right now the licenses still are not broadly let and our modeling was essentially a one year lag from when the TD base station started shipping in volume which was similar to the 3G deployment and that really isn\u2019t happening right now. So we\u2019re kind of on pins and needles here waiting for those licenses to be let, so we can kind of model when that might start.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from FBR Capital Markets.","Christopher Rolland","So you mentioned clouds from wireless, so is that really from just Asia? How much of that is non-Asia? And then the magnitude and timing on Europe and perhaps even India, does that play into your forecast at all for next year?","Jon Olson","Yes so I -- correct me if I\u2019m wrong here Moshe, but I think the clouds are on communications broadly not just wireless and what we see on the wireless side is weakness in the short-term and deployments going out in North America that has caused us some short-term shipment issues meaning this quarter and this past quarter and next quarter, specifically capital being diverted away from AT&T and Verizon and in other places. But probably more prominent Sprint is having more issues with rollouts and so the OEMs that we ship to that supply the Sprint LTE rollout has been cutting back orders because they have not been getting orders from Sprint as best as we can understand. And so that softness in North America is some part of that I would say early in the year. And then to your kind of a follow through to the question related to Europe and India, in our mental model right now we have not modeled either one of those geographies taking significant product at this point in time and probably into next year as well, we\u2019re still looking into that phenomena because we\u2019ve seen no signs of that going I would say growing in a very significant way at this time yet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup.","Chris Danely","I guess, what gives you confidence that this is purely a demand problem versus some share loss?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, the numbers on 28-nanometer are growing again very rapidly actually and if you look over the past three years we believe that we\u2019ve been consistently above 60% and it sort of peaked last year probably at around 70% and it's still well into the 60s now. So, I don\u2019t believe that it's a result of that, the other thing we\u2019re seeing is 28-nanometer now all elements that are growing. So, the high-end, the Virtex side, the Zynq side, and the Artix side are growing too and in the past a lot of growth came from the mid-range Kintex and now as this expands the breadth and depth of our product portfolio continues to give me confidence in that regard.","Jon Olson","And just one more thing, if we think about the way we cast the second half of this current fiscal year previously and where we think now almost all of our shortfalls are around situations that are more demand related over older products than 7 Series and that wouldn\u2019t typically not indicate share loss because no one redesigns an older product, right. So it's really around that doesn\u2019t seem to be around any of the leading edge.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya","I actually had a clarification and a question on the clarification, maybe if you could also give us some more color on how we should think about gross margins given the weakness in the mix. Is it better to think gross margins could be, say, 67%-68% than the 69%-70%? And then Moshe for my question, if you could just give us the status of your 16-nanometer FinFET engagement with TSMC, what is the status there? And do you expect to get products out on time this year? Thank you.","Jon Olson","So, on the gross margin side obviously we told you the gross margin estimates are for Q4, so you can get that at FY15 and FY16 we\u2019re obviously not done with our planning at this point in time. We certainly are -- we have been running the Company at 68% to 70% range that\u2019s our goal to do that as well, and so at this point in time I wouldn\u2019t give you a -- I certainly wouldn\u2019t give you a lower number to plan for, for gross margins. We do think that with the strength of our hand at 28-nanometer and as good as that profile is for us from a cost perspective as well, I am feeling reasonable about providing that range at least for now.","Moshe Gavrielov","Vivek and with regards to taping out the program continues and the relationship with TSMC is excellent. We\u2019re getting absolutely outstanding support. The design is a very challenging design and as a result we expect for it to tape out a couple of months later than we had originally expected. So, this is -- we\u2019re probably looking at the May timeframe as opposed the March timeframe which is our latest estimate for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.","Ryan Carver","This is Ryan Carver in for John. I just wanted to get a clarification. You gave some color on the fiscal '16 as being driven by a strong 28-nanometer, but offset by global comms and some weakness in aero and defense. But if I look at some of your 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer business, I mean share has been declining year-on-year for the last four quarters and if I think about sort of where 28-nanometer product goes, primarily it\u2019s been into the comms end-market. So I guess, how comfortable are you guys in thinking that 28-nanometer is going to be able to drive this outperformance in fiscal '16 given your commentary about comms and aero and defense sort of equating to probably north of half of your revenue for the year next year? And the continued 40-nanometer declines.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure so 28-nanometer is a very broad and deep product offering and there is lots of elements to it and there are different components and different families that are targeted at specific different applications. It addresses all of the markets we\u2019re in absolutely all of them and is an expansion play into additional areas. It would be correct to say that in the last year of production was driven by wireless comms, but it\u2019s not that that\u2019s the only market that it has addressed. And if you look at the early shipments they weren\u2019t necessarily into comms at all, they were in ASIC emulation, they were actually into some consumer markets and all of these continue. What is happening is as the family of product has rolled out and has been extremely successful, more and more are moving into significant production and growth that you see now back to over 150 was actually driven by growth on the Virtex front, growth on the Zynq front and growth on the Artix front and those addressed numerous markets not only comms.","So it\u2019s broad, it\u2019s growing significantly, it\u2019s the fastest growing product we\u2019ve ever seen and we\u2019re very confident that if you look at the numbers then it grew from 100 million to 380 million if you look at our projection of over 160 it will come in at about 580 million for the year. We expect significant growth beyond that. So that is growing rapidly and it\u2019s going to be the most successful and broadest portfolio we have. Having said that, when you look at 40 and 45, we continue to see strength and on the 45 which is the low-end product offering the Spartan product offering whereas we believe that 40-nanometer is no more or less peaking for us at this point in time. In terms of market share on 40-45, it hasn\u2019t necessarily shrunk, it\u2019s sort of going up and down over the past year I would say and that\u2019s our valuation.","Jon Olson","Yes Ryan if I could just point out a little bit, I mean it\u2019s one of our bigger growth areas for this year and in the future is industrial -- our industrial business as well as automotive and those are both primarily driven by growth in our 45-nanometer and our Zynq product families and so as you think about the momentum in those end-markets that have been clear over the last year or so and that momentum we believe is going to continue it is transitioning from older products into these new or higher valued products at higher ASPs where we are getting a tremendous amount of benefit. And then also even within the wireless space there is a transition going on away from older products Virtex-5s and 6s into the 7 Series and to big Zynq products going into the wireless function, so we\u2019re going to see more growth in the 28-nanometer area even in the comms thing. So don\u2019t write off comms totally here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra","Back when the HD TVs were ramping there was demand for FPGAs into TVs and also in broadcasting which helped your consumer business. Do you expect a similar trend to happen with the rise of 4K TVs? And do you see any interest there also in OEMs and what would be the timing on that?","Jon Olson","Yes Tristan, this is Jon. Yes we have actually already shipped quite a bit at the tail-end of last fiscal year and the beginning of this fiscal year into the high -- or excuse me the 4K-2K or ultra high definition televisions. We also are beginning to ship into OLED technology based televisions as well and we do expect to be in the television business longer than some of our previous generations were in for the initial of HD and the initial [Audio Gap] and then got phased out rather quickly. We seem to have quite a bit of activity going on across all the current manufacturers for that business, so that is a good opportunity for us, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava","Moshe, I just had a clarification on the FinFET comments you made. Is this an issue emanating from the difficulty, in your opinion, TSMC is having or is it coming from the Xilinx side? And just as a quick follow-up, what\u2019s the timing from tape out to when we should expect production volume? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So there are no issues with TSMC, they have had numerous tape outs already, they are giving us full support. The design whenever you encounter a new generation of product tends to unearth problems that you did not anticipate and as a result the closing of all of these issues is taking a little longer plus the challenges related to design for FinFET transistors are more significant. So it's not a TSMC challenge or issue at all, it's just our ability to finish the design with their support. After if you look at our business typically what sort of happens is tape it out, you get it back after a few months, you go through a lengthy evaluation cycle and then you move it into production at which point in time it takes two to three years until it reaches high volume production. So, it sort of depends if you look at 28-nanometer, we reached $100 million production I think three years after we tape out the product\u2026","Ambrish Srivastava","Do you mean a quarterly run rate of 100?","Moshe Gavrielov","No, not a quarterly, overall 100, okay sorry, okay anyway it takes years until you reach the -- yes I am sorry, it was the quarterly that I was looking at\u2026","Ambrish Srivastava","It\u2019s alright, that would be too long.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sorry about that.","Ambrish Srivastava","That\u2019s okay. We all knew what you meant, Moshe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges","This is Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. I want to ask a longer-term question, specifics that you can comment until you have the Analyst Day that would be very helpful color. Just wonder if there is any change longer-term in how you're thinking about the OpEx profile of the Company as we transition to a server environment or on the capital allocation profile of the Company as well? Thanks very much.","Jon Olson","From a spending profile, certainly we are not going to -- we\u2019ll update you more a lot more about what we think about FY16 there, but mostly it\u2019s comment around next year\u2019s positioning the Company from a flat to low growth environment we\u2019re certainly very aware of what that means and we are working towards spending goals to match that thought process. But from a longer-term perspective, R&D intensity as we have these nodes go more rapidly closer together until maybe we get to 10-nanometer it is causing us a little bit of headwind that we\u2019ve been able to manage it through a variety of different techniques and decisions that we made. So I am not too worried about any sort of a bigger ramp in spending coming on. And relative to capital allocation again it is based on a lot of factors including what our plans for excess cash would be beyond returning to shareholders, but our primary situation is to continue to think about dividend first and favor that and then the share repurchase is opportunistic as what visibility I have today about the future, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be changing that policy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.","Blayne Curtis","I just want to go back to the wireless segment with the March guidance will be down four quarters in a row. So you talked about some end-market issues but I am not aware of other companies seeing these declines. So I was just curious, as you look back, what\u2019s really causing this? Did you see ASIC replacement? Is there a mix shift to the mid range in than fiscal '15 guidance, you talked about uncertain outlook, how much are you expecting this business to come back for you within that? Thanks.","Jon Olson","Yes so, Blayne the short-term issues on the wireless business really is not as much China as it is the rest of the world for us and some of the softness that\u2019s gone on. All I can do is tell you what we believe, our customers are saying and since we have the lion share of the share among PLD companies in support of the Sprint rollout that has been something that has disappointed relative to our expectations for this quarter and we believe that leads into the forecast for Q4 as well. The China aspect, we actually had China grow as we anticipated so that wasn\u2019t necessarily the short-term issue. But we are -- we did also I believe signal we were a lot more bullish on wireless growth in China because of phase 3 rollout in March and while we\u2019re not seeing decline there, we aren\u2019t seeing the same relative acceleration of growth in China that we had originally said. So, it's not like our wireless business is going away it\u2019s just that is not increasing to the point that we had said. With respect to FY16 I think Moshe was trying to characterize the cloud overall, with communications being a global rough spot for global spending not specifically targeting some geography in wireless. So we\u2019re not really going to give a guidance right now and our thoughts on wireless for FY16, we\u2019ll do that in March.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri of CLSA Securities.","Srini Pajjuri","Moshe, more of a philosophical question, I am just looking at the business over the last three years and based on your guidance for fiscal '16, on average there isn\u2019t a whole lot of growth here. I think in fiscal '10 you grew I mean a couple of years ago you grew about 10% fiscal '14 but outside of that. So, my question is obviously R&D is running at fairly high OpEx is running close to 40%. As the leader, I am wondering, does it still make sense to chase the Morse Law? I mean is it part of the business that you have to continue to invest in Morse Law? And my question is, why wouldn't it make sense to kind of slow it down a little bit and kind of bringing that OpEx number down?","Moshe Gavrielov","So that\u2019s great philosophical question which is we could spend hours debating, but let me give you my two minute response here. You\u2019re right in pointing out, if you look back that the growth has not been sustained so for Xilinx it was -- grew to 1.8 billion it was at 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion for several years then took a jump to the 2.4ish billion level and has been at that point for more years than we believed it would stay there. And that clearly is disappointing, having said that, we do believe that this is a business. As the semiconductor industry is maturing, being at the leading edge enables us to capture a larger SAM and in order to do that we\u2019re investing in order to exploit that and provide those solutions. Now the first node where this was possible in a big way, we believe is 28-nanometer and we do see and we will -- we understand that it\u2019s incumbent upon us to show the proof, we do see in quite few cases more ASICs going away and customers transitioning into FPGAs and to a lesser degree but nonetheless this is happening to some of the traditional ASSP providers can no longer keep up and that provides an opportunity for us. In order to do that, we need to have both different products and a big investment in the software enablement to enable us to capture those markets. We\u2019re making those investments now and we believe that the return is still ahead of us and an example would be the Zynq product line which enables us to participate in a bigger way in automotive, a market where we only had a very fringe participation in the past. So I can\u2019t argue with your numbers right, the numbers are what the numbers are, but I fervently believe that the opportunity is still ahead of us to capture these markets and we\u2019ll give you more insights into that in the March timeframe, but excellent question and thank you for asking it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Ruben Roy","Moshe, I just wanted to throw in another question on the communications discussion. In terms of that end-market, you historically haven\u2019t provided longer-term guidance and now you're giving us a little more of an outlook from a longer-term perspective. And I am wondering if some of that is driven by what you\u2019re seeing in addition to these clouds around the design environment? Has anything changed in the design environment from your big customers that globally that sell into the service providers as it relates to FPGAs, would you say? Or do you think that, once you get by fiscal 2016, that you can still think about some of the CAGR growth rates that you guys have discussed historically around the various communications markets? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","So we believe there is opportunities for growth in both wired communications and wireless communications. We will try to size those. Wired in particular has been frustrating for us. For several years now we\u2019ve predicted growth, projected growth and it hasn\u2019t happened, even the 28-nanometer on the wired side it\u2019s taking longer for those very significant designs to translate into revenue. Nonetheless, the opportunity is there and the wired market is not going away, but we\u2019ll give you a deeper and more accurate response in March.","Jon Olson","I think from a design environment though I think, as Moshe said earlier that we are seeing a ASICs being replaced, we are participating in the aggregation that\u2019s going on as there can be continued consolidation in the infrastructure business. We are still seeing lots of opportunities for us out there.","Moshe Gavrielov","And things like the SDX environments, those design environments have specifically targeted to enable us to address those market more smoothly and more efficiently than we have in the past. So, there is a need to provide somewhat of a different approach in order to expand the population of designers we have there and that includes communications, but it's not only limited to communications.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","You talked about a slow growth environment but you've also got the third highest gross margins in semis after Linear and PMC-Sierra. So, have you thought about going after some new volume applications, perhaps with some price elasticity?","Jon Olson","Yes we definitely have a posture here that\u2019s about offering profit dollars with respect to that, so it's not like if a deal doesn\u2019t look like 59.7% to us, we won\u2019t bid on it we won\u2019t go after it that\u2019s not the case at all. We certainly think about this as a portfolio and a opportunity. The issue becomes what -- when are those that still make sense that an FPGAs is the right answer because obviously bidding at a negative 20% for some single function capability doesn\u2019t really add any value to shareholders also we don\u2019t do that, but we absolutely have looked at broadening applications within our existing markets and we\u2019ve made certainly done some of that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Suji De Silva from Topeka. Your line is open.","Suji De Silva","Just a couple of questions on 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer, on 28, where would you say we are in the cycle now versus where 28-nanometer peaks? And for 20-nanometer down the road, do you expect to have a similar shape of ramp versus 28, or somehow distinct? Thanks.","Moshe Gavrielov","So 28 our position has evolved and we actually think it's going to peak later than we have originally expected and to last longer than it had originally expected. Potentially with a slightly smaller peak, but actually similar area under the curve and we are still years away from that peak and we\u2019re seeing a lot of markets that are addressed by our product just starting now to move into production and probably have another two or three years before they move into production. So the accumulation of which generates the peak is still years away. 20-nanometer, the way we look at it is 20 and 16 together are should be equivalent to 28 in terms of their capabilities and that\u2019s because they are coming very close together in terms of introduction. And so if you -- there was a previous question that I manage to confuse everyone with my response, but it took three years to reach $100 million on 28-nanometer and that\u2019s a quarterly number and our expectation is if you look at the combination of 20 and 16 and if you could sort of shift them back to start at the same time then you should hopefully reach the same number in with the same level of success of that point in time. Now we\u2019ll see if that sort of happens and it will -- but if you look at 20 alone it won\u2019t match what 28 has done and if you look at 16 alone, it won\u2019t match what 28 has done. The expectation is that between the two of them it should come close to what 28 has done in a more or less similar timeframe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann","But, Jon, can you give us a sense, last year, what the end-of-life product sales were? Or maybe you can give us the past couple of years? Thanks.","Jon Olson","So we haven\u2019t provided that detail information, we\u2019ve talked about it not being particularly material. In the last couple of quarters we certainly were shipping I would say incrementally more of that into aerospace and defense and that continues to -- will continue to trail off over the next couple of quarters. I don\u2019t, again Han that we really haven\u2019t quantified it because it hasn\u2019t been that significant over the last couple of quarters I would say uniformly in any given quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.","Sanjay Chaurasia","Hi, this is Sanjay for Romit Shah. Moshe, one question you indicated your frustration with the wired segment and I was wondering if you could drill down a bit deeper and which specific segments in wired you think have disappointed you? And when you talk to these customers, just wondering what is the take on it, you have better products, more integration in your FPGAs, what is it that's been so disappointing? Why you are not seeing the growth from these segments?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well I think we\u2019ll give you more context in March, but fundamentally this is a multi-year challenge we have run into and it sort of -- it\u2019s just for several years that is the one segment that we have continuously predicted growth. We have the design wins and they\u2019re taking longer to move into production and when they move into production they yield less than we had expected them to. So we\u2019ll try to break it down by category. I would say that you\u2019re right in pointing out that it\u2019s not fair to tower everyone with the same brush. It\u2019s a very broad market with several sub-segments so we\u2019ll highlight which ones are moving faster and which ones appear to be slower, but I don\u2019t have that information with me now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Wu of Indaba Global.","David Wu","I just have one clarification. As I listened to the Cisco call, their business in the wireline kind of segment, were surprisingly strong in the U.S. and even their European business wasn't that weak. I was wondering whether this is a phenomenon of one company doing relatively better than the other ones or is this a generalization that you can see across your customer base?","Jon Olson","Yes I don\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t really studied anything Cisco had said and I think in the short run here David, but I know Cisco sells in a lot of different applications not necessarily all wired communications. They are in broadcast, or in cable and equipment and as you know that we said we had lower than expected performance in that area in this last quarter and so sometimes it is application specific or sub-application specific or not. And I\u2019m certainly not trying to pile on Cisco negatively either on wired or broadcast we had weakness in other customers as well. We\u2019ve had geographic weakness from a European perspective as well, so we are -- it often is not what the entire company is doing, it\u2019s more about the industry and sometimes it\u2019s about our specific applications in the industry. So I think all we can do is point out to where we play and where we sit, it\u2019s hard for us -- it\u2019s hard for me to comment on what I think about Cisco\u2019s strength or weakness in any geography.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Parker Paulin of Wells Fargo Securities.","Parker Paulin","Could you speak for a moment about your 40-nanometer revenues this quarter and just provide a little bit more color in that space? Thanks.","Jon Olson","Yes so our new product category is made up of 28-nanometer and then our 40-45 so there is two generations of technologies and so our overall new products numbers were down a little bit. And we updated that our 28-nanometer was up substantially, so that leads you to believe obviously by actual subtraction that the 40-45 was down. Within that it was a broadcast related and some communications. The low-end that Moshe talked about continues to be quite well. And that was doing well so it was really the high-end and it was related to the communications segment and broadcast so it really ties nicely to the overall disappointment if you will because of that. And that another way for us to describe that to you would be there were some older products that are either going through transition or there is slow demand by their end-markets depending on which customer and which situation that we\u2019re driving that.","Operator","At this time, we have no additional audio questions.","Rick Muscha","Great, thanks for joining us today.

With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We\u2019ll provide a financial and business review of the September quarter, and then we\u2019ll open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available, and actual results may differ materially. We refer you to documents the Company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo Flores","Thank you, Rick, and hello, everybody.","Sales in the September quarter increased for the eighth consecutive quarter to $620 million, up 1% sequentially and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Sales for the first six months of the fiscal year were also up 7% versus the same period of the prior year. Our growth continues to be driven by our advanced products which grew 21% year-over-year, supported by the overall strength of our product portfolio. Gross margin was 70.2%, in line with our guidance.","Operating expense was $249 million, less than guided as R&D came in slightly lower than expected. Operating income for the quarter increased 2.6% sequentially to $185 million and our operating margin was 29.9%. Tax rate for the quarter was 10% including a discrete item related to the accounting standard for the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q2 was $168 million, or $0.65 per share.","Some key points on the balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $1.9 billion net cash after our debt. Operating cash flow was $202 million. We returned $257 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form of $87 million in dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.6 million shares for $170 million, an average price of $65.04 per share. We continue to execute on our share repurchase program with the intention of exhausting our authorization over the next several quarters. We currently have $445 million remaining on that authorization.","We ended the quarter with diluted shares of 258.2 million shares, which included the impact of 7.6 million shares from the warrant associated with convertible debt. The convertible note itself had no impact on shares for the quarter, as the note was completely settled in mid June. For a complete explanation of the impact of the outstanding warrants on share count, please refer to our convertible FAQ on our Investor Relations website. With our stock price higher since the time we established our FY18 share count guidance, we are now expecting ending share count in Q4 FY18 to be in the range of 255 million to 260 million shares.","Now, onto guidance. In the December quarter, we are expecting sales to be between $615 million and $645 million. Our backlog is up significantly heading into the quarter and we expect continued growth in our advanced products. From an end market perspective, we expect industrial and A&D to increase again. Communications is expected to be approximately flat while broadcast, consumer and automotive is expected to decline.","Our gross margin will be approximately 69% to 71%. We expect operating expense to increase to approximately $260 million, with R&D driving the increase. We continue to invest in both our technology and our customer relationships as we expand our leadership and our markets. Finally, our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 14%. Our financial performance year-to-date and our guidance for the third quarter indicate to us that we are on track to our annual guidance that we provided at our analyst day.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Lorenzo. I\u2019m pleased with our consistent execution as demonstrated in the September quarter financial results. We delivered our eighth consecutive growth quarter with sales increasing sequentially to $260 million. Our operating profit increased approximately 30%, enabled by gross margin and with slightly better than expected and tightly managed operating expenses.","We continue to benefit from the combination of our diversified multi-market portfolio coupled with clear technology leadership over the three most recent nodes. Five of our eight end markets increased in the quarter. Our industrial, aerospace and defense primary end market set the new quarterly record with sales of $278 million an increase of 17% from the year ago quarter. The broadcast consumer and automotive segment also delivered significant sequential and year-on-year growth.","On the product front, our advanced products category delivered record revenue. This category, which already represents 52% of our overall revenue, will continue to be our growth driver in the foreseeable future. Our Zynq SoC platform, critical element of our multimarket expansion effort, delivered another sales record of growing 65% from the year ago quarter. The Zynq SoC platform now comprises 12% of our overall revenue. Expanding on this theme, our industry disrupting RFSoC family targeted at 5G cable and wireless backhaul applications is already shipping to numerous customers.","20-nanometer sales increased very significantly and also attained the new sales record, driven by strength in multiple end markets. 16-nanometer portfolio continued its accelerated sales ramp, again setting a new record. We\u2019re now shipping 34 unique products to more than 930 broad market based customers. This is a very substantial sequential increase of 50% in the number of unique devices, 75% in the number of customers, both are significant harbinger of future success and demonstrate our technology leadership as noted.","I\u2019m gratified by the recent significant announcements highlighting our strong customer momentum in cloud computing. This is one of our key medium to long term market expansion opportunities. As projected in our previous earnings release, Amazon Web Services has made a uniquely differentiated SDAccel development environment available to F1 users while also expanding their FPGA as a service F1 deployment to multiple region. In addition, Huawei announced their FPGA as a service instance based on our Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA. Finally, Alibaba, the largest cloud service provider in China recently announced their next generation FPGA as a service F2 and F3 instances, both based on Xilinx technology.","The significant type of scale customer adoption momentum is enabled by the combination of silicon leadership coupled with advancements we\u2019ve made with improving ease of use. This will enable a much larger community of software and application developers to derive full benefit of FPGA acceleration.","Finally, as we look forward to the December quarter, our guidance of 615 to 645 is expected to be driven by the accelerated growth of our advanced products portfolio delivered across numerous end markets and all three of its technology components. Achieving the midpoint of this guidance will establish a very significant new sales record for Xilinx. Consequently, we remain confident that we\u2019ll deliver on our fiscal year 2018 revenue target of approximately $2.5 billion. In addition, while we continue to invest in our technology leadership, share gains and market expansion efforts for sustained revenue growth, we remain committed to delivering 30% plus operating margin exiting this fiscal year, as well as preserving our commitment to returning cash to shareholders.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from William Stein from SunTrust.","William Stein","Moshe, I\u2019m hoping you can help us sort of align what we hear as very good traction in the early stages of these deep learning projects by the web scale providers on the one hand versus sales coming in a little bit lower than expected in that end market for the quarter, and perhaps some effervescent optimism about that end market? I\u2019m wondering if you can help us sort of think about how we should expect that end market to trend over the next few quarters and beyond.","Moshe Gavrielov","Actually, sales didn\u2019t come less than expected; they came where they were expected. If you look at communications on a whole, wireless was down but data center business was up. But, we are at the very, very early stages of deployment of this technology. And it takes series of time, typically years from when the deployment starts to when the potential is realized. As such, what we are directing everyone is to $200 million to $300 million in calendar year 2020, and that\u2019s still a plan and we are on plan to deliver that number. It just takes this length of time. The biggest impediment we had was expanding the potential customer base. And programmable logic in the past has been directed only at hardware designers. And in order to make it available to a broader audience, we have developed this SDAccel capability that is now being deployed. That should enable the adopters beyond the traditional existing users of our technology and that will -- that gives us confidence in the potential of achieving the $200 million to $300 million.","But patience is important on this because it just takes time until it has that viral impact. And the broad acceptance by, by far the biggest things we think is huge stepping stone towards that. And as the -- that together with the SDAccel are the enablers. And over time, we do expect to see this translate into revenue at a faster rate, but we have been very clear with regards to setting expectations as to when that will happen and we continue to project the $200 million to $300 million in the 2020 timeframe. It\u2019s the right thing to plan [ph] at this point.","William Stein","One more, if I can, related to the same topic. Investors are seeing some outstanding growth from NVIDIA in GPU for similar applications. Maybe you could give us a very summarized version on how you compete with that technology among the web-scale providers and all the engineers and companies that want to develop AI applications, what\u2019s the sort of pitch for FPGA relative to GPU today?","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. So, the biggest historic advantage, and NVIDIA had two significant advantages, one is they recognized this market very early and pursued it several years ago. And as a result of that what they\u2019re seeing now is the fast growth but that similarly to our predictions, it took several years until it manifested itself in revenue. The other advantage they had is that inherently a software -- it\u2019s a software program technology and now we\u2019ve gotten to the point where our technology can be addressed in the same way. The advantages we have largely in the area of providing overtime superior performance in a broad set of applications, typically at lower, significantly lower power point. And over time, we expect that to be important in a broad set of applications. So, that\u2019s the value proposition and that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing these deployments that these -- obviously very significant hyper scale companies are one of the biggest issues when you look at these big compute firms is power is the big limiter. And we can provide them with either higher performance in some applications, not in all of them or definitely on a broad basis we can provide similar performance at a much lower power points. And the combination of those two are prevalent and are likely to provide over the next few years the opportunity for growth for us. But that\u2019s the biggest difference is the delivering the software accessibility, which we now have and also catching up, which we\u2019re executing with vigor on that front too.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.","Ambrish Srivastava","I\u2019ll be courteous to my fellow analysts and ask only one question. It may not be your favorite one, Lorenzo, but certainly one of my favorite ones, accounts receivables. Going up two quarters in a row, they went up last I think three or four quarters ago and then you brought them down. But, I\u2019m just looking at Q-over-Q and Y-over-Y, receivables are going up higher than sales, both on Y-over-Y and Q-over-Q comparison. Could you please help us understand why that\u2019s the case?","Lorenzo Flores","Sure. I think in general, the same phenomena is happening over the past couple of quarters that happened when we had the relatively high numbers in the past, and that\u2019s just timing of shipments in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a quarter where our receivables got very high; next quarter, we reported very low receivables, and that\u2019s about a year ago. And the key thing we monitor on that is the quality of the credits underneath that, -- are these customers going to pay? And the answer is in general, it\u2019s a very, very, very high rate; we have minimal, negligible write-offs on the receivables. And so, we\u2019re highly confident, this is all collectible and will show up in cash flow. And we\u2019ll see different patterns maybe in the future based on timing of shipments during the quarter. But that\u2019s really all what happens. Shipments in the last months tend to be collected the next month or the first month of the next quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays.","Blayne Curtis","Moshe, I was wondering if you could just go back to the com business. You mentioned in the September wireless was down. Just curious what trends you are seeing in wireline. And then, I know visibility has been kind of low for people, just curious your perspective as to when wireline can come back?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, if you look back at the previous quarter, the June one, wireless had a huge surge, and that tends to volatile. And indeed this past quarter, the September one, it trended down quite a bit actually. And our expectation is that wireless in December will go up again, maybe not as high as it was in June, but we should see growth there. Wired, generally speaking has been flattish with somewhat of a downturn, downward trend, it sort of -- not a huge downward trend but it is trending down, and we are not at this point predicting any huge surge; it\u2019s likely to go sideways or maybe continue on a very slow downward trend this coming quarter. If you look at our overall results and Lorenzo broker it down into the three categories, then, our expectation overall is for communications to be flattish and very significant growth on the industrial; and the third market, the broadcast, auto and consumer to be slightly down. And that should net significant upside overall.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Robert W. Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Looking at data center, are you seeing interest from anybody for a Xilinx FPGA becoming the first access point in the data center, basically delegating the CPU as a second integral? [Ph] And how big is the opportunity for FPGA to become more of a central point in some data center application in the medium term?","Moshe Gavrielov","If it become any time soon, the first one, then my $200 million to $300 million would be ridiculously low number. And so, what is happening is a transition, which is now accelerating in the industry and it\u2019s a transition where CPUs have basically exhausted their ability or have only minimal ability to provide higher performance to these very parallel applications. As a result, there is this transition to heterogeneous architectures, which have a CPU and have other forms of acceleration. GPUs have been pursuing that several years now and now it\u2019s very significant business for the GPU vendors. And programmable logic has emerged as a third alternative. But, we don\u2019t expect it to supplant CPUs totally. And that\u2019s -- but it will provide a very significant enhancement for this heterogeneous computing and will provide an alternative and that it\u2019s not that CPUs will go away but there\u2019ll be a need for less CPUs for some of these applications and they will be replaced by other modes of acceleration in particular programmable logic over time.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Moshe, I wondered if you could just go a little bit into the broadcast consumer and automotive segment. That had a nice pop sequentially. So, could you just describe what that driver was behind that? And then, with the guidance for that to be down a bit in the quarter, I know the automotive is the sexiest part about that. But, could you give us a little more detail on what\u2019s driving that sequential decline as well, please?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, I believe that all three of the sub markets actually grew quarter that we just reported. And we expect automotive actually to continue growing but the other two to shrink somewhat. And overall, it\u2019ll be flattish to slightly down with -- I mean, that\u2019s our current prediction with automotive continuing to grow. And these markets are actually quite desperate, you can call them the other markets to some extent, and they\u2019ve different dynamics, which drive them, automotive what is driving our growth is continued deployment of numerous generations of driver assistance technology and that\u2019s sort of the biggest driver of the technology there. In consumer, it\u2019s a whole plethora of applications, which from time-to-time have surges and we benefitted from one of these surges this past quarter. And broadcast has been doing well but it\u2019s a small market for us and that\u2019s a market which is going through structural change where as a market generally, it\u2019s not growing in a big way and there\u2019s a transition to the cloud in some of the broadcast applications. So, that\u2019s one of the inhibitors to its growth. That\u2019s about as much color as I can share with you at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore.","C.J. Muse","I guess the follow-up to Ross\u2019s question on ADAS. I believe this was roughly a 5% business for you guys in fiscal 2017, curious if you think this could be a 10 plus percent business over the next two to three years. And then, specific to today, can you provide an update on customers transitioning to 16-nanometer and how this is impacting both unit demand as well as your ASPs? [Ph]","Moshe Gavrielov","So, let me start from the last question, or the last sub question that you asked. We are seeing in ADAS transition from our original Zynq product to our MPSoC, which is the 16-nanometer generation, pickup there has been quite substantial. And quite a lot of the customers are now deploying the second or third generation, which is in 16-nanometer and we expect that to be a big growth driver for us going forward. We do expect this market to provide double-digit growth per year with the potential for that continuing for next few years. And that\u2019s just with the -- for the deployment of ADAS and the new generation of ADAS, and then early versions of automated -- autonomous driving, which will have very powerful, centralized control unit, but then will continue to have a lot of additional auxiliary technology required to implement the solution. And we will likely play significant role in the second part. We are not differing the first ultra-high performance processing portion of it. And so, if you look at the arithmetic, could it get to 10%? Yes, it\u2019s sort of moving that direction but I think it has a few years ahead of it to deliver on that potential.","Lorenzo Flores","Just to clarify, C.J., was your question on 16-nanometer related to the broader adoption or just in ADAS?","C.J. Muse","It was just within ADAS.","Lorenzo Flores","Okay.","Operator","And then next question comes from David Wong from Wells Fargo Securities.","David Wong","Further on the thoughts products for ADAS. In the future, will there be any specific types of hard course or other specialized types of circuitry that you might want to incorporate in your offerings for ADAS or autonomous driving applications?","Moshe Gavrielov","I\u2019ll let Lorenzo, go first because Lorenzo drives much fancier car than I do and that you can take that one for the bank. So, I think he will be more of a true consumer advocate of this. And then, I might add color later.","Lorenzo Flores","My car is 10 years old and the driver assistance is in the form of mirrors. But the serious answer to your question, David, is embedded in the products we have today, particularly the Zynq-based SoC products are hard in IPs that are well-targeted to the needs of our customers who are developing ADAS applications, not the least of which our features that enable safety and security at the device level. So, yes, I think we continue to evolve our platforms in that area with -- again, overall, it drives a greater integration of capabilities that really provide that longevity and the platform design for our customers. So that\u2019s the overall view of what\u2019s going in our products that will be suited for ADAS. Moshe, do you want to add anything?","Moshe Gavrielov","Yes. And specifically, if you look at the MPSoC and I\u2019m tying this to previous question, if you look at that that\u2019s a 16-nanometer product, then there is hardened safety, hardened security, there is hardened [ph] graphics, there is a lot of hardened cords. You just can look at that. A lot of those were added there based on request from our automotive segment, and that will continue to be the trend going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore","I guess one clarification, I think you said, Lorenzo, that backlog was up significantly. Is that quarter-on-quarter? And if so, how does this extend backlog and then sort of flattish guidance or slightly up guidance, are you just seeing longer lead times, can you talk about what\u2019s driving that?","Lorenzo Flores","So, let me talk. Yes, backlog is up significantly in the quarter. And this actually relates back to Ambrish\u2019s question on AR. We do have an unpredictable, if you will, pattern in any given quarter of what goes in the book, when the customers want to ship. And, we work with our customers obviously to hit their schedules and their requirements and drive our business at the same time. So, there are occasions when we\u2019ll have the book fill up toward the end of the quarter and that kind of carries forward into the next quarter, and that\u2019s the phenomenon we\u2019re seeing. So, no, it\u2019s not a function of lead time or anything structural like that; it\u2019s a timing thing.","Joseph Moore","And then, for industrial, you\u2019re obviously growing a lot there. I mean, can you talk a little bit the sustainability of that? And how much of that is sort of the share gains you guys have been talking about, whether it\u2019s Zynq related or process node related, versus just a stronger industrial environment?","Moshe Gavrielov","I believe, it\u2019s a combination of the two. And the environment is stronger and we\u2019ve been waiting a long time for this to happen. But now, we had a very, very, very broad set of design wins in industrial, which was Zynq based. And we were getting a little antsy because they were taking a long time to translate into revenue. Good news is that that is happening now, happening very broadly, and it\u2019s where we believe we have a very strong position vis-\u00e0-vis a traditional competition but we\u2019re also seeing fewer and fewer dedicated ASSPs which are targeted this extremely fragmented market. It\u2019s just the market which has built up a lot of very small niches and it\u2019s very difficult to come up with an ASSP that addresses them all. And so, our position there we believe is very strong. And what we\u2019re seeing now is the Zynq design wins, 28-nanometer move to production.","If you look at Zynq, then the first generation was primarily wireless oriented and there was a lot of that and that\u2019s happened relatively early. Then the second generation, which is continuing now is in driver assistance in automotive. And now, we\u2019re seeing the expansion into a lot of different markets and the industrial also -- aerospace and defense is also, we\u2019re starting to see those translate to revenue now. So, both the markets we believe are doing reasonably well or actually better than they have been in long period of time. And our competitive position is stronger than it has been as this market continues to be very fragmented and there\u2019s less, very targeted ASSPs that can pick off these small niche applications.","Lorenzo Flores","Joe, I want to go back to something I actually didn\u2019t address in your question that I picked up, which is you said, a flattish guide. I think I would want to point out that the midpoint of our guide is $630 million, which is meaningfully up from where we are today, so strong backlog is consistent with that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.","Vivek Arya","Moshe, I just wanted to revisit the assumptions underlying the $200 million to $300 million opportunity that you have set out of calendar 2020. Is that opportunity just for Xilinx or do you think that\u2019s for the entire FPGA market? And if it is for all the FPGA makes, then, how does the competitive landscape impact that number? Because even if it may not be all the way there today, surely in the next three years, they can use their incumbency to add more competition in that market. So, any color there would very helpful.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. So, we -- I agree with your observation. When we look at the 200 million to 300 million, this is our number. We expect the overall number for programmable logic to be significantly higher, at least twice as much. Intel does have a very significant design win in this area with Microsoft that\u2019s being very well documented in its public domain information. And this is just starting. And there is seven major hyper scale companies and then there is the two additional ones who are pursuing this with vigor, at least two that we\u2019re involved in, which is Huawei where have the design wind and IBM where we have a very type relationship. So, if you look at our overall position together with the ones we\u2019ve already announced and we\u2019re engaging with all of the others. The 200 to 300 is what we believe we can do in data center in its various forms in that time frame. And the market in of itself we expect to be quite a bit larger than that, at least twice as big. And obviously Intel has its incumbency that is true but we have superior product on the acceleration side. And we believe it will get a significant share of the market based on that. Market overall should be significantly more than that.","Vivek Arya","And as a very quick follow-up, maybe for Lorenzo on OpEx growth and I know you\u2019re not providing the guidance for next year yet. But, at what point should we start to see your sales growth do better than OpEx growth? Thank you.","Lorenzo Flores","So, you\u2019re right. We have not provided any FY19 guidance yet and we will do that in the course of time. Just on OpEx, I will -- want to repeat something I\u2019ve said in previous calls with respect to the flow this year; we are expecting it to decline in the fourth quarter of this year. We have some local highs here in this current due to take out expenses primarily. So, we expect it to decline in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.","Toshiya Hari","I had a follow-up question on your cloud computing business. Last month, at your developer forum, I think in the keynote, the gentleman from the AWS gave a very constructive and positive commentary on your offerings and how they would expand that business going forward? And obviously, from a customer diversification perspective, you have announced couple of partnerships. So, I guess the question is, I appreciate this is going to take a long time, but what would you need to see to gain incremental confidence then for you to raise that long-term number?","Moshe Gavrielov","We would need to see broad adoption, and that tends to be viral, so you get the early adopters, we start using it, some of them start seeing superior results. It generates some excitement, and then you start getting more and more of these application developers. And I think, the key metric will be when will we see the next acceleration in the application developer. Realistically that couldn\u2019t happen up to now because it was limited to FPGA designers with SDAccel and all of the additional things we are doing. We now have provided the foundation for that. And expectation is that it will feed upon itself, once they start seeing superior results in terms of acceleration. And so that will be the thing to watch. And I think the fact that you are seeing Huawei and Alibaba within less than a year jumping in and following in Amazon\u2019s footsteps that is a proof that there is a lot of potential here, because you now have three very significant players providing this as a service. Amazon obviously started a year ahead of everyone and is still way ahead of everyone, at this point, but the others are going to pursue them with vigor, as you can tell from their announcement. And the expectation is that the applications, which will benefit from this -- from parallelism, which is inherent and available, and programmable logic will be the driver for expansion of this, both in the cloud and over time in embedded applications too.","Operator","Our next question, we will retry the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.","John Pitzer","Quickly, Lorenzo, going back to the OpEx and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I thought that this year was going to be a relatively tan [ph] year for tape-outs and that would have been a tailwind for OpEx reductions and what sort of offset that was some of the software development work you needed to go after new application acceleration. One, was that wrong? And I guess, two, on the second side of software OpEx to go after new opportunities. Has that expense peaked or is that something that will continue to grow out over the next couple of quarters and how do we think about OpEx around these new applications?","Lorenzo Flores","I think the best way to think about OpEx with respect to those new applications and in general is, go back to the guidance we have provided for the full year, which is going to be between 990 and 1010 millions of dollars for the year in terms of OpEx. Take the guidance I just gave and add to it the first couple of quarters, we are right around $750 million of OpEx for the year. We are going to be -- going to be in our range. We\u2019ve accommodated both the new investments that you talked about with respect to software development and our tape-out schedule. The comment I made around tape-out was explaining why this particular quarter we\u2019re going to see OpEx go up and then go back down in Q4.","Moshe Gavrielov","And the current tape outs are due to 16-nanometer going to production and happening faster than we had expected, plus a few additional expansion products like the RFSoC, which was sort of new. And so, it was never expected to be the low tape-out there. And the reason that it\u2019s a high tape-out here is the technology is doing so well or relatively high tape-out, the technology is doing so well and it\u2019s in such pristine condition that we are now rolling out the entire product offering, and that\u2019s why we have 34 unique products already shipping. And that\u2019s been -- you multiple that 34 number by several million dollars for each tape out. That\u2019s sort of an expensive occasion. [Multiple Speakers]","John Pitzer","My second question is just a follow-up, Moshe. Last week when TSMC reported, I was a little bit surprised after the first time ever they called out sort of crypto currency ASICs as being a meaningful driver of their business in the quarter. And if you start to look at the breakdown of some of these crypto currency hardware devices, often times you are finding an FPJ sitting next to these ASICs. And so, I\u2019m kind of curious, is this the sizeable market that you guys think about, how big today under what sort of end market category are you putting this or how do we think about the size of this market and I guess importantly the sustainability?","Lorenzo Flores","Actually, you\u2019ve framed the question quite well, John in that. So, maybe, we are little too elliptical when we are talking about our -- the strength in our consumer business. We do see -- we do have meaningful business with some of the crypto currency providers, like you said the role our product plays, which is typically a Zynq-based product is as a controller, if you will for these ASIC-based mining platforms. We don\u2019t -- at the same time, we say that we acknowledge this meaningful business in this quarter. We obviously want to see some longevity in that business and breadth of that business before we point it out as a key driver. We are really happy with it right now but we don\u2019t want to get a little bit overheated in talking about the potential for this. We do, as I said, I\u2019ll go back to same words, some longevity in that business and some breadth across multiple customers for that business for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Danely from Citigroup. ","Chris Danely","On the communications and data center business, how much these days is comp versus data center? And then, where do you expect that to be in say year or two?","Lorenzo Flores","As we continue to talk about the nascent state of the data center business, or at least emerging hyper scale data center business. And as you know, Chris, from following us, we\u2019ve always had storage and network-based business in the data center. It\u2019s about the same size as it ever was. The vast majority of the data center, I mean, the communications and data center business is wireless and wired. And then the true data center piece has been around 5%. And that\u2019s again transitioning from the older businesses that we had their into this newer hyper scale data center opportunity.","Chris Danely","Any projections for year two?","Lorenzo Flores","No, not yet","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, 200 million to 300 million, and it\u2019s not there yet. So, it\u2019s significantly less than that, but that\u2019s the projection.","Operator","Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Research.","Srini Pajjuri","Hi, Moshe, just a question on competitive landscape. It looks like Intel is finally shipping their 14-nanometer part. Just curious as to what you\u2019re seeing out there and which end market, if any do you think that they\u2019ll be more competitive versus less competitive?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, from everything we\u2019re hearing, there continue to substantially issues on performance, power and software. And to the extent that they have shifted with relatively selectively to their very, very largest customers, which makes a lot of sense. We, to contrast, shipping it now, it\u2019s close to a 1,000 customers and we have 34 distinct products and counting, so already shipping. So, we believe that the leadership we have in terms of the breadth of applications that we can support, quality, the lower power, the better service performance are still very significant. And what we\u2019ve heard from customers is that the lead we have in terms of the majority of the technology is a year and a half or more, which is very significant, it\u2019s probably more than we\u2019ve had any point in time in the past. So, not saying they\u2019re not around but so far our breadth and quality are helping us prevail. And if you look at the results on the 16-nanometer, it\u2019s growing at an incredibly fast rate, it\u2019s actually growing much faster than we had expected it to grow, at this point in time. So, we continue to do well with this technology. And we never rest on our laurels as we have a very worthy competitor, but we\u2019re raising to exploit the huge lead we have.","Srini Pajjuri","And then, just one clarification, Moshe. I think you said wireless will grow in December quarter. I know it\u2019s a lumpy business but just curious as to what\u2019s driving that growth in December, whether it\u2019s China or India or something? Any color would be helpful.","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, we think it\u2019s all of the above. We think that the past quarter was a substantial low quarter -- substantially low quarter. And that what you\u2019re seeing is we saw some inventory reduction at our largest customers and we think that now they\u2019re going to be shipping again based -- and we\u2019ll benefit from their lower levels of inventory which they had built up before, and that should help us across the board but in China and India in particular too. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Caso from Raymond James.","Chris Caso","My question is on automotive. And I guess what we\u2019ve seen presently in ADAS system, there is generally some content from PGA, some purpose-built silicon and general purpose. As we go forward and that industry matures, what\u2019s the reason that FPGA stays on the board and what\u2019s the reason that that content stays with FPGA and wouldn\u2019t necessarily consumed into ASIC or general purpose?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. That\u2019s the great question. What is happening is this market is evolving very, very, very quickly and much faster than it typically has in the past for traditional automotive. And there is huge race to provide higher content and to address new sets of sensors and things of that nature. And those are evolving very, very rapidly. So, if you look at where we\u2019re seeing success is we are seeing success not with our traditional programmable logic, but actually with our Zynq product line. And as the Zynq think product line is actually very powerful embedded processing, don\u2019t think it\u2019s just this programmable logic; it\u2019s actually a very powerful embedded processor with a lot of hardware built accelerators and tightly linked with programmable logic.","Now, the value of the programmable logic there is that it enables the customers to have a platform-based solution where they can adapt the platform very quickly to address numerous models and numerous changes. And as this market is evolving very, very quickly and there is new sensors and new algorithms and there is some elements of machine learning which now being integrated into it, then the programmable logic is actually very well-suited medium to address those. So, that\u2019s why we believe that there will -- as it continues evolve rapidly, we can actually provide a fine tuned solution with the control, with a lot of the embedded hardware, accelerators and with the programmable logic. And so, it\u2019s sort of a different from the traditional ways of thinking of programmable logic but it\u2019s just used for prototyping. Here it\u2019s actually -- the Zynq product offering covers huge portion of what the customer requires; the embedded hardware addresses other areas; and then the programmable logic and its flexibility is actually well attuned to rapidly changing market.","Where I do agree with you is saying 2030, 15 years from now, if the whole market becomes commoditized and doesn\u2019t move, that\u2019s when it is likely to be less advantageous to have these capabilities. But, there is a long way between where we\u2019re now and when it reaches that stable point. And as -- even though there is a tremendous level of excitement on autonomous driving, it\u2019s going to take several years before it becomes the prevalent form of transportation. And that\u2019s likely to take tens of years in reality. And as it evolves over this period of time, it will change, and we are likely to continue to have attractive value proposition for all of the areas which are dynamic.","Now, just to sort of highlight, so I\u2019m not overselling, we are not addressing the ultra-high performance central processing element, the ones which NVIDIA is pursuing and Intel is likely pursue and potentially other players, we are looking at the rest of the market even when it evolves to autonomous driving; there\u2019s going to be a lot of additional auxiliary functions which we will be very well adaptive.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ruben Roy from MKM Partners.","Ruben Roy","Moshe, I had a follow-up on the competitive discussion you were just having a couple of minutes ago. It seems like you are competitor, Intel, has recently increased their focus on 10-nanometer, and it seems a little surprising given the issues, the well-known issues they\u2019re having with 14, the conversation has shifted to 10 at this point. But just wondering from your perspective and now that you have some product in hyper scale data center customers and various new applications. Are you hearing any feedback from customers around acceleration potentially of your own roadmap or how is that all working out?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, we have accelerated 16-nanometer very significantly, and that the significant number tape-outs this year were to move it all into production. That\u2019s where we believe we have the broad leadership at the current nodes. And so, I think we\u2019re in violent agreement with you on that front, as our customers. We are working feverously on our 7-nanometer solution with TSMC. We expect to tape that out next year. And we are very pleased with the progress that TSMC has made. And I was just at their 30-year anniversary and they\u2019re full steam ahead. We are -- very, very, very big mobile customers of sort of standing in line, they are all there and they are targeting their next generation 7-nanometer and we will be immediately after them, taping out our devices and benefiting from the huge learning that that volume will run through the system. So, in this business, if you ever stand still, you are likely to have the tortoise and hare scenarios. So, we are running as quickly as we can to make sure that we continue to exploit our leadership and prolong it into the next generation. For us that is taping out next year and it is going to be a phenomenally attractive generation of technology.","Ruben Roy","Just a very quick follow-up, just point of clarification on the commentary on data center and percentage of revenue et cetera. When we think about traditional products that you are selling into whether it\u2019s networking, storage et cetera. How do you think about that? Is that sort of a steady state type of business that\u2019s going to grow at low single digit percentage type of growth rates? And the new stuff is really just starting out from a very small numbers today, obviously with the expectations for fast growth or as the traditional stuff sort of maturing in and following off while the new stuff comes up?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, that entire industry is going through a transition and significant portions of it are getting cloudified. And when they get cloudified, there is opportunities on the networking and storage as well as the acceleration side. So, what we expect to see is portions of what we called wired communications, reemerge as our data center business but they will still be used for storage and networking. And it\u2019s sort of somewhat similar with regards to the technology requirement. So, that\u2019s likely to be a significant transition for us. But, it will probably offset each other without having tremendous impact either away.","The growth area is acceleration and the acceleration is the growth area because it really provides an alternative to the traditional CPU computing. So, I think your read is correct that the transition is happening and the classification is going to change and to some extent, it might at some point become a little more difficult to figure out what is wired business and what is data center business. And at this point, we look at them as adjacent and transitioning from one to the other, but the technology requirements are similar on the networking and storage side, and they are unique and different on the acceleration side. And that\u2019s the growth opportunity. So, hopefully that provides some color to your question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.","Vijay Rakesh","I was just wondering when you look at, you talked about incenting [ph] and how you see Intel performing down the road. Have you seen NVIDIA coming into incenting market as well? And today the GPUs are probably bit tied but do you see them being a viable competitor in that market too?","Moshe Gavrielov","They are definitely focused on influence too [ph] and they are coming out with new versions of their technology, which are quite departure from their traditional GPU architectures. And if you blur your eyes, they actually look a lot like more technology that we have, a much better match for than the traditional GPUs. And I think what they are doing makes sense. They have a good position and good starting point. But for broad applications and influencing, different architectures than traditional GPUs or GPU derivatives are required. And as you look at some of their new solutions, they actually are moving in that direction. And we believe we are ahead of them in the flexibility we can provide actually as the advantage, the inherent advantage we will continue to have over time.","Rick Muscha","Okay.

My name is Ian and I will be your conference operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha - Senior Director, Investor Relations, Xilinx, Inc.","Thank you and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO, and Lorenzo Flores, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then we'll open the call for questions. During the quarter, we reclassified our product categories to be consistent with how these categories are analyzed and reviewed internally. Specifically, we are grouping the products manufactured at the 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes into a category named Advanced Products, while all other products will be included in the category entitled Core Products. This representation is consistent with what was presented at our recent analyst meeting.","For comparative purposes, we have provided supplemental information on our website at www.investor.xilinx.com that presents results based on previous classifications. Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available, that actual results may differ materially. We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It could be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Lorenzo.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Rick. In the June quarter, Xilinx sales were $575 million, up 1% sequentially and up 5% on a year-over-year basis. Advanced Products increased 10% sequentially and 60% year-over-year, with 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer products each reaching record sales and 16-nanometer beginning its revenue ramp. As expected, Core Products declined on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Communications increased 4% sequentially with growth from both wired and wireless. Communications has staged a modest, but consistent recovery since bottoming in the June quarter a year ago and is up 22% on a year-over-year basis. Industrial and A&D was down slightly with strength and test measurement and emulation not quite offsetting expected declines in industrial and aerospace and defense.","Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive was flat on a sequential basis, slightly better than anticipated due to stronger orders from Zynq-driven ADAS applications. Both automotive and test and measurement reached record levels for the company in the June quarter. Gross margin in Q1 was 70.7%, higher than guided due to the mix of customers and products in addition to increased manufacturing efficiencies. We continued to aggressively optimize gross margin across our product portfolio. Operating expense, at $220 million, was in line with our guidance. Operating income for the quarter was $186 million or 32.4%. Other income and expense was an expense of $5 million, as guided.","The tax rate was 10% for the quarter, better than guided. This included the impact of the early adoption of an accounting standard related to the treatment of stock-based compensation. Our net income for Q1 was $163 million or $0.61 a share. This included a positive $0.02 a share impact associated with the accounting standard I just referenced.","Operating cash flow was $339 million, driven primarily by strong profitability and a significant reduction in accounts receivable. Diluted shares were $266 million, including $10.5 million from the convertible. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million and we paid $84 million in dividend.","Some key points on the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in gross cash and $2.1 billion net cash after our debt. Inventory was $195 million, up $17 million from the prior quarter and down $27 million from the same quarter a year ago. We continued to manage our inventory by balancing levels against expected demand and potential upsides from customers. Accounts receivable declined $90 million to $217 million, reflecting ordering patterns during the quarter.","Now, turning to our September quarter guidance, we expect revenue to be approximately flat. We enter the quarter with backlog that is down sequentially, but we have forecasted demand from key customers that is not currently reflected in our backlog. As a result, we expect turns for the quarter to be approximately 54%. We expect Advanced Products to continue to grow, with 28-nanometer sales increasing to a new record, 20-nanometer exceeding $40 million and our 16-nanometer UltraScale+ family demonstrating material growth.","With respect to end markets, Communications and Data Center is expected to decline after four consecutive quarters of growth. An increase in wired business will not completely offset a decrease in wireless sales. Industrial and A&D is expected to grow, driven primarily by strength in test, measurement and emulation along with growth in Aerospace & Defense and ISM. Broadcast, Automotive and Consumer will be flat sequentially.","Our gross margin will be approximately 70% and our operating expense will be approximately $230 million, including $1 million of amortization. The increase in operating expense is in line with the investment in accelerating our leadership position, as we discussed at our Analyst Day. Other income and expense will be an expense of $4 million and our tax rate is expected to be 14%. Share count is expected to be $266 million.","Finally, at our Analyst Day in May, we discussed our expectations for 4% to 8% growth in revenue for FY2017 along with gross margins in the 68% to 70% range and the accelerated investment I just mentioned. As we end our first quarter, we believe we are on track on all of these elements.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. (7:43) the financial results of the first quarter. We delivered revenue growth which was above the midpoint of our guidance and profitability was very strong. Our overall revenue growth was driven by sales of our Advanced Products, which increased 60% year-over-year and reached a new quarterly record. Overall, this demonstrated the strength of our diversified multi-market portfolio, with five of our eight end markets growing in the quarter.","Gross margin reached 70.7%, resulting in an operating margin of 32.4%, the highest level in a year. We generated a record level of cash in the quarter, continued to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder return through both dividend and share repurchase. Our exceptional execution on the 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes has now delivered three consecutive generations of unquestionable technology leadership. This is a testament to the success of our engineering and operations teams, working in concert with our world-class, industry-leading foundry partner, TSMC.","The June quarter, for the third quarter in a row, our overall 28-nanometer sales delivered a new record. The overall 28-nanometer sales growth benefited from broad sales contribution from communications, industrial, automotive, test and measurement and consumer. In addition, our Zynq product family, a significant element of our market expansion efforts, reached a new sales record in the June quarter. Overall, 28-nanometer sales, including our Zynq offering, are expected to grow again in the September quarter.","20-nanometer revenue again reached a record level as sales in the quarter significantly exceeded our $30 million forecast. Virtex UltraScale, the industry's only high-end 20-nanometer product offering, continues to grow at a very significant rate as do sales from our Kintex UltraScale product family. We expect to ship over $40 million of 20-nanometer product in the September quarter. This accelerated 20-nanometer ramp continues to exceed our original expectations.","At the 16-nanometer node, we have delivered all three UltraScale class product families ahead of schedule. We are already shipping six unique products to well over 100 customers and getting excellent feedback, in particular with regards to its production level quality, further extending our industry lead to well over a year. Consequently, we are accelerating our 16-nanometer tape-out schedules and broadening our offering at this node. This broad 16-nanometer product offering is being designed into applications in all of our major end markets and is enabling more platform-based designs than any previous generation.","These advanced products are building significant momentum, enabled by four multi-market industry growth drivers: cloud computing, Embedded Vision, Industrial IoT and 5G wireless. In cloud computing, we're in production with three of the largest hyperscale data center consumers with two more in extensive trials. Additionally, we led the formation of the very broad CCIX Consortium with the singular role of bringing a high-performance, open acceleration framework to data centers. We're winning in fast-growing Embedded Vision applications across numerous markets including industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, broadcast, and consumer. In particular, our ADAS penetration in automotive will reach 85 models this year.","With regards to Industrial IoT, we're seeing continued success with both Zynq and Zynq UltraScale+ families, securing platform design wins with the largest Tier 1 players. Lastly, in 5G Wireless, we have 90% market share in pre-5G proof of concept deployments and 5G prototyping. We have attained an unprecedented position of strength, opportunity and momentum. This is driven by our exceptional execution, leadership products and customer adoption in the four multi-market drivers which will fuel long-term revenue growth. We are committed to maintaining this leadership while delivering 30% plus operating margin in the long term and continuing our strong commitment to shareholder return.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. Our first question comes from the line of Ian Ing.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So Intel last week talked about being on track to ship Stratix 10 to customers, some samples this year. Obviously, you already shipped last year. Any thoughts in terms of what the potential share split is given the timing of product in customers' hands? Perhaps some boundaries around the share splits.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can say that being more than a year ahead is tremendous benefit, having the broadest product offering is a tremendous benefit, having. Having production level material faster than we've ever achieved before is a tremendous benefit and that's why we're investing to exploit the leadership we have. So we have no idea how it will turn out, but this is the strongest position we've ever had over the past three nodes.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks, Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Wong.","David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks very much. What were your total revenues from Zynq in the quarter and what are currently the biggest end markets for Zynq?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So Zynq, just a second, well, let me start with the end markets for Zynq. The Zynq end markets, I think the showcase end market for Zync is really automotive and ADAS applications. The product is strong in wireless as well in many different applications and is also leading the Industrial IoT platform wins that we have. We think it's a little bit in the, what we call it, as a percent of our total revenue, 8% or so of our total revenue in Zync and continues to grow strongly quarter on quarter and year on year.","Operator","And our next question is the line of William Stein.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great, thanks for taking my question. Moshe, you talked about the CCIX at the Analyst Day and you mentioned it again today. Can you sort of frame the current impact or expected impact of this? Are there products that are relevant to this consortium? Is there any revenue or customer interest? Any details would be helpful.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So this is a market which today is dominated by Intel's very strong position on the server space. It's a market which is fast emerging; it's expected to be a very large market going forward and the expectation is that it will get split between additional players as competitive products are available from these players. Now these competitive products can come from a variety of architectures. They can come from x86 solutions; they can come from power-based solutions and then they can come from the numerous players who are committed to the ARM architecture. Those additional ones are still to emerge at the performance level which will enable them to penetrate the market.","CCIX is basically an opportunity which now has been identified by all of these other players as the need to have a common interface standard that all can integrate and support. From our perspective, we did, at the analyst meeting, talk about one product, at least conceptually, which targets this market which will be implemented in 16-nanometer and then will have our traditional all-programmable devices at 16-nanometer and also a whole host of solutions at 7-nanometer that address the market. For us, we believe this has the potential of being several hundred million dollars in the 2020 timeframe. In order to get to that point, it was really essential to have this multi-partner opportunity, open multi-partner opportunity, in order to enable us to participate broadly in it. And so, at this point in time, our revenue in data center does not yet comprehend this opportunity. It's more in traditional storage and networking data center applications. Over the next few years, we expect our business to grow to reflect that. So that's about as much information as I can give at this point in time. I hope it helps.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's helpful. If I can get a follow-up, in server acceleration in the data center, there is discussion not only of FPGA being helpful here, but also GPU. And I'm wondering if you view that as a stable competitive environment or if the dynamics there are changing. Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So as I said, this is an emerging opportunity. And as such, the historic position is clearly led by Intel. And that's driven off their server and high-performance strength. NVIDIA definitely identified several years ago this as an opportunity and they have invested heavily and we believe that there is a host of applications which are served well by a GPU solution. But that is a subset and not a particularly dominant subset of the future applications that will use this. And so we do expect this market which is a large market and will grow rapidly over the next few years to be serviced by numerous solutions from numerous players. GPUs definitely will be one, but they have a whole host of applications where, due to power and a whole host of other issues, they don't provide an optimum solution and programmable logic actually can provide much higher performance per watt per dollar, the most \u2013 the best solution in that regard. And that's why we're talking to all seven major hyperscale players and a few other players too. And we believe that our solution will have value for a whole host of these new applications. Having said that, we expect that GPUs will continue to do well in this market too.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Chris Danely.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks guys. Just a clarification on the yearly guidance. So you're sticking with the guidance provided at the Analyst Day. On the gross margin, could it be 70% for the next couple of quarters? And then on the OpEx, are you still saying that SG&A is going to be flat and that the 7% to 9% growth is all R&D?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I'll start backwards. On OpEx, that guidance is essentially true, we can see plus or minus a couple million dollars. But in aggregate, the expense growth is R&D.","On gross margin, I'm not going to go into specific guidance for the second half. The 68% to 70% range for the year that we provided at the Analyst Day comprehends a few different scenarios about how the actual revenue, product and customer mix would come out. And so I think we're comfortable leaving that range.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ross Seymore.","Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi guys. Just a question from the end market side of things in your Communications and Data Center side, out of that 44% of revenues, can you remind us the split between wireless and wireline, and to the extent the wireless side is falling off, how do you view where we are in the wireless market? Obviously a year ago, we had a huge inventory drawdown and then you've grown nicely since then. Is that inventory refill back to a normalized level and will we ship with demand from here forward? And if so, what are your views on demand? Thank you.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So as you look at Communications and you break it down between wired and wireless, what happens is they tend to have different characteristics. Wireless tends to be more choppy. Wired tends to be more gradual in terms of its growth. What we've seen is on the wired side, basically driven by a very strong technology portfolio, that business has been growing now consistently, and in particular, it's being driven by 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer shipments.","On the wireless side, it is volatile. It had its ebb, its lowest point in the June quarter of last year and since then it has recovered. It's grown by about 40% since that low point. It hasn't gotten back to its peak and we don't necessarily expect it to get back to its peak. Its peak was about 2X higher than its low point. But it's hovering just about in the middle and we expect it to continue to go up and down, but more around this new number, right, as opposed to the low point. And it will be based on deployments. During the past quarter, China was steady, India was up; EMEA was weak. North America was steady; it sort of tends to change from quarter to quarter as the deployments are geographically spread around the world. But we do expect Communications generally to continue to grow. And if you can neutralize the wireless volatility or sort of flatten it out, we do see that the communications market overall, including data center, to be a long-term growth driver for us. Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Vivek Arya.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question. And Moshe, thanks for the color around the wireless business. I had one follow-up to that. If you look at your content in a base station today, how does it compare to what you had the year before or the year before that? I understand the volatility in deployments. But over a longer period of time, when I look at the low growth in this Communications business, for not just yourself, but for your competitor as well, has it been a unit issue or has it been a content issue? That yes, units have been volatile, but is it possible that content has not grown at the same pace? And any color around that would be very useful. Thanks.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So from generation to generation, the level of integration is much higher and the power reduction requirements are becoming more and more significant. And as such, we're seeing a higher level of integration and our customers are moving to the higher end of our product offering. It's still \u2013 it's not the high end. It's not Virtex products, but it's Kintex and Zynq products. And generally speaking, the percentage of the dollar content which is implemented in programmable logic, be it Zynq or be it a non-programmable solution, has gone up from generation to generation.","What we're seeing \u2013 and so if you look at the numbers, on average, 4G was higher than 3G. Best we can tell, 5G is an incredibly sophisticated requirement with \u2013 and as we are being used in a vast majority of the early deployments, these are not going to be the massive deployments. Those are still three or four years ahead of us. But we're sort of seeing the level of complexity is very high and unquestionably, the level of integration is high. And I would say generally speaking, the average price that we realize has gone up with a significantly higher level of functionality. The volatility is due to markets happening at different rates. In particular, China is very difficult to predict, but I wouldn't say that overall we've seen the dollar content shrink at all. It's gone the other way at this point, per unit.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tristan Gerra.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon. Could you elaborate a little bit on the operational efficiencies and mix? I know you're not providing a gross margin guidance beyond this current quarter. But if you could explain a little bit what's happening in terms of operational efficiencies and whether there is a lasting effect that we can expect beyond this coming quarter.","Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. So, Tristan, as you know, the gross margin has direct price, direct cost and manufacturing overhead type of components that drive it. And we have a portfolio of customers, a portfolio of end markets. And the customers all take, in those end markets, a portfolio of different products. So what we see across the board is a continued drive toward manufacturing side efficiencies, getting our products at lower costs over time. We see continued price pressure from our customers across the board. And larger customers, obviously assert more price pressure. And we just \u2013 we try to balance that and continue to get the broad savings to manifest themselves in our overall gross margin.","On the overhead side, that will swing from time to time with different factors and what we're doing with inventory strategies. But in general, we're approaching manufacturing efficiencies there very aggressively as well. So as is common in the semiconductor industry, costs continue to go down, but price pressure continues to increase. And we, again, try to manage that through the broad portfolio that we have.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just to sort of summarize because Lorenzo gave you all of the data without answering the question, we think the 68% to 70% will continue to be in the foreseeable future where we are. Could we from time to time, as we are now, just rise above that? Yes. But that is neither our target nor do we think that it's a sustainable goal going forward.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ambrish Srivastava.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you. We talked about Communications. I was wondering if you could talk about the other end markets. And specifically embedded in your guidance, what are the \u2013 how are these end markets behaving versus what you would normally expect if there is any such thing as normal in the semi industry? That would be helpful if you could provide us with some \u2013 extra additional color on the other major end markets. Thank you very much.","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So, Ambrish, we break it down into eight markets overall. And we're very pleased that we hit above the midpoint. But if you look at the growth overall, it was not huge. It was driven by five of the eight markets I think we highlighted, which \u2013 those were in terms of the past product. And it's wired and wireless were up, automotive was up, Consumer was up and test \u2013 yes, test was up quite significantly.","Going forward, we're looking at flat, right? So there's probably going to be some up and some down. And I can only give you a short-term projection at this point in time. But as you look into the second half of the year, if I had to guess, we do expect Communications to continue to grow slightly. We expect A&D to be flat. We expect Automotive to be up significantly, driven by the large number of design wins we have and we would expect ISM also to get back into a growth mode. So that's the best forecast we can give you for the second half based on what we know now. And just for the upcoming quarter, I think Lorenzo gave some of our prognostication there. Next question, please?","Operator","Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. Our next question is from the line of Anil Doradla.","Anil Kumar Doradla - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So Moshe, I think you referred to Zynq contributing about 8% of revenues right now. A little surprised. I thought that would be higher; might be in double digits. Now is this contribution volatile or it's been pretty much in the \u2013 kind of the high single digits over the last couple quarters?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Anil, I think we were quite clear in the past. If you look at our entire offering, there's several generations that are now contributing, the first generation where there was a Zynq product line was a 28-nanometer and that's providing nearly all of that number. It's driven by three markets, as Lorenzo mentioned: wireless, automotive and industrial market. Of those three, wireless has gone into production; automotive is going into production and should grow very rapidly and the industrial market tends to move quite a bit slower. So that is ahead of us.","What you will see is as the 28-nanometer grows, then the next growth vector, which is driven by the Zynq product line, will be a 16-nanometer where we have a lot of design wins. You could assume that that will follow a similar pattern to what we've seen at 28-nanometer. So \u2013 and this'll drive our market expansion. It'll just be delayed by three years or four years vis-\u00e0-vis what you saw at the 28-nanometer in terms of its significance. And that's the nature of the businesses we're in. They move at a slow rate. So as it's a new product line with a new role in the customer systems, it has now \u2013 starting to be significant. But in the same way the 28-nanometer took several years to get to where it is now, Zynq, which is a subset of that and was late \u2013 was the last part of the product offering we rolled out is now starting to hit its stride market by market.","And the next growth in 28-nanometer is going to be in automotive then. By industrial, we actually see a lot of aerospace and defense going forward and then we'll start seeing the 16-nanometer version. Would I like for it to be faster and \u2013 yep, I would. But reality is that's the nature of the business we're in. Hope that answered your question.","Operator","Our next question is Romit Shah.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Kristin Shaka (37:14) in for Romit. So my question is more on the automotive side. Even though we've had some strong results in the automotive semi space so far this earnings season, I think we're still seeing some concern about declining vehicle unit SAAR. Are you seeing any weakening in auto unit demand in the coming quarter or do you think demand is going to hold steady?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So we are expanding both the footprint we have in terms of the models that include Xilinx-based ADAS systems, and those \u2013 as well as the depth, continuing to move from premium to mid-tier to lower-tier in terms of the offering. So unit growth is going to be less of an impact to us than overall penetration and expansion. That, as Moshe said earlier, will show as significant growth in the automotive business for us through the year.","Operator","And our next question...","Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Pitzer.","John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Moshe, I kind of want to go back to the gross margins. And given how high your gross margins are, it's a little silly to nitpick. But when I look at the quarter just reported, you would have thought that both by end market and geo, that the mix would have provided actual headwinds to gross margin, you guys actually put up really good numbers. And I understand the long-term target that you talked about of 68% to 70%. I'm just kind of curious as to why that is the long-term target. Do you feel like that's the gross margin level needed to drive your growth aspirations? I'm just kind of arguing, given the value you bring to customers, why shouldn't gross margins migrate up to that sort of low- to mid-70%s range permanently?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, you're right, it's a balance between growth and profitability. And we think we are striking the right point here with \u2013 we believe that we can over time generate more gross margin dollars if we stay at this level and not aspire to higher levels. And that's the trade-off that we are striving for at this point in time. And there's very few examples that are sustainable at higher levels that can provide growth. And one of the things we want to do is to deliver the 6% growth on average over the next few years. And so that's what we are targeting at this point in time.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Ian Ing with a follow-up.","Ian L. Ing - MKM Partners LLC","Hi, yes. Thank you for a follow-up. Apologize if this was asked, but turns higher in September because key customers are giving you forecasts instead of firm orders. Could you talk more about the applications there and what gives you confidence those forecasts will become orders actually?","Lorenzo A. Flores - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I won't talk about the specific customers or applications, but we have done extensive work in identifying the additional orders that we expect to come in this quarter to hit our revenue guidance, and we have confidence that those will come in.","Operator","And our next question is another follow-up from Chris Danely.","Christopher B. Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks, guys. So your major competitor was acquired a while ago. I was just wondering if you can maybe give us some perspective on, has anything changed over there? Has it been about as you would have expected, anything different going on across the way?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're definitely focused on our execution. What we are seeing is, we seem to be very far ahead. We were far ahead on 28-nanometer, definitely very far ahead on 20-nanometer and we appear to clearly have this one-plus year advantage on 16-nanometer versus their offering. We are pursuing this with gusto. I think that by the end of the year, it will be clearer how Intel will decide to maximize their return on their $17 billion investment.","And \u2013 but at this point in time, I would say that the \u2013 as I check with our sales force, they appear to be winning based on the very strong technology portfolio, both on the silicon and the software and the IP that we have. And that is a multi-year investment we have made which has come to fruition now. And I believe that most of the success we're seeing now is a result of that as opposed to anything else. I do believe the jury is still out with regards to how Intel will pursue the market long-term. There are various options they have, some of which may make more sense to them than the others.","But when you look at the customer base, we're seeing customer base becoming more and more interested as there's massive consolidation in the semiconductor industry which everyone, including yourself, have commented on numerous times, the customers are recognizing that they need to align with companies who are around and are committed to perpetuating their model. And that, I believe, has benefited us over the past year as it has become clearer and clearer that we're committed to this business and we're committed to technology leadership. And I think that's the other thing which maybe has changed in the competitive environment is actually the customer's approach is quite different. And that's not only due to Intel, but it's due to other things that have happened in the industry which are highlighting that there are fewer and fewer players who are going to be around to advanced nodes. And Xilinx has demonstrated that it can and will do that. And our increased investment is another proof point that we're going to be there for them. Any more questions?","Operator","And our next question is a follow-up from Blayne Curtis.","Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Lots of calls tonight. I just wanted to follow up back on that, Moshe. Obviously, you can see the timing of your products and it does appear that you have a lead. I guess when you look at the results and you still get them from your competitor, they're growing a little faster year-over-year. And obviously, it's hard \u2013 you have to look at a broader period here. I'm just kind of curious. At this point, 28-nanometer and 20-nanometer should be contributing some outperformance. So you're in the weeds. I'm just kind of curious to hear your perspective as to why that hasn't shown up yet and when do you think you should be able to see some outperformance from this year again?","Moshe N. Gavrielov - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Blayne, the numbers \u2013 the competitive numbers are very sparse. There's one number. There's no breakdown. There's lots of things that can be done. There's no understanding if it's new nodes or old nodes, right? And all I can say is we knew \u2013 we've grown our Advanced Products 60% year-over-year. That's 28-nanometer, 20-nanometer, and 16-nanometer. So \u2013 and that's what is happening. The old nodes are now contracting, in the contraction phase. They're contracting at a slower level than they had been in the past, so we think that the headwind from that is going to be slower. And what we're seeing is massive growth of our new technology and massive sets of design wins and very close alignment from the customer.","So I don't \u2013 I think all of the data which is available is such that indicates that Xilinx continues to do extremely well. And I think it's \u2013 if there was a huge breakdown, we could \u2013 a more detailed breakdown, we could tell, right? But it's like this is great in terms of technology leadership and in terms \u2013 and it's great in terms of revenue growth at these new nodes. And that's what matters for us. So it's going to be more and more difficult to do meaningful comparisons going forward. But we're very comfortable with our position; we're very comfortable with the absolute results we're delivering and we're very comfortable that our market share on new nodes now for three nodes in a row is substantially \u2013 and that is substantially \u2013 above the natural market share in the past. The analysis of that and what the outcome is, is pretty clear.","Operator","Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone.","And at this time, I'm showing no further audio questions. Presenters, I turn it back to you.","Rick Muscha - Senior Director, Investor Relations, Xilinx, Inc.","Okay. Well, thanks for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions]","Please limit your questions to one to ensure that management has adequate time to speak to everyone. I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, our CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the June quarter and then we will open the call for questions.","This quarter we changed our revenue by product category classification. We make changes to this classification on a regular basis as products mature and new products are introduced, and there have been the product categories to be more meaningful to investors.","In addition, we consolidated the other end-market category into the Communications & Data Center end-market. For comparative purposes, we have provided supplemental schedule on our website at www.investor.xilinx.com that presents results based on the previous category classification.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.

This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. Xilinx sales were $549 million, down 3% sequentially and within our guidance. Profitability remained strong during the quarter with a better than expected gross margin continued OpEx control and a healthy cash flow generation.","New product sales decreased 10% in the quarter, almost entirely driven by 28-nanometer products which were impacted by weak sales to Wireless customer. Sales from 20-nanometer product exceeded $10 million during the quarter doubling from the prior quarter.","From an end-market perspective sales from Communications & Data Center remained weak, decreasing 11% sequentially. The greater than forecasted decline was driven by Wireless Communications, which was weaker than anticipated due to continued decline from a broad-based of customers predominately serving the China and U.S. markets.","Wired sales were as expected for the quarter. While shipments into the Cable Access business were particularly strong, overall CapEx spending remains weak. Wired Communications was the largest end-market contributor to 28-nanometer revenues in fiscal Q1.","The Industrial and Aerospace & Defense segment was better than forecasted driven by ISM and A&D. ISM sales were a record during the quarter. Sales from test declined as expected.","Lastly, Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive was essentially flat as expected. Although, flat sequentially, sales from Automotive are up nearly 50% from the same quarter a year ago and remained at a record 7% of total sales.","Gross margin was 70.9% for the quarter better than anticipated, primarily as a result of product and customer mix, although we continued to be focused on driving improvements and profitability.","Operating expenses including $2 million in amortization were $211 million in line with expectations. Other income was the net expense of $11 million, slightly better than forecasted due to long-term investment gains. Net income for the quarter was $148 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Operating cash flow for the June quarter was $183 million before $8 million in CapEx.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 271 million, there was a 9 million share dilutive effect from a convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertible debt, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $100 million during the quarter and made a record $80 million payment in quarterly dividends. We returned nearly 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders during the quarter.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2 billion. Inventory dollars at Xilinx decreased $9 million sequentially.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter of fiscal year \u201916. Our backlog heading into the quarter is down sequentially. Communications is forecasted to be flat. The Wireless market continues to be challenging and is negatively impacting our previously stated full-year revenue estimates. While we do expect improvement in the second half of fiscal \u201816 from increased spending in China, North America and India, the rate of improvement remains difficult to forecast.","Wired Communications continues to be impacted by a weak CapEx environment, although, we expect to continue to benefit throughout the year from revenue growth in new programs where we have displaced ASSP\u2019s in addition to gaining share in traditional FPGA sockets. The strengthened of these programs are in the areas of Cable Infrastructure, Access and OTN.","We expect the Industrial and Aerospace & Defense segment to be down substantially due to a decrease in A&D driven by the expected conclusion of a large program. Xilinx\u2019s 28-nanometer parts were recently design into subsystem to the next-generation program that is expected to begin production in fiscal year \u201817. Although the Aerospace & Defense market has been characterized by quarterly volatility, this segment remains an important business for Xilinx.","Our 28 nanometer revenues are growing at a rate much faster than previous new product introduction as we expand our presence in areas such as situational awareness, public safety and embedded vision systems. ISM is expected to be approximately flat during the quarter and Test is expected to decline.","Lastly, we expect all components of the Broadcast, Consumer and Automotive category to be approximately flat. We expect strong growth in Automotive in fiscal \u201816 as Zynq enters volume production at many large OEMs. As a result, we are expecting total sales to be down 2% to 6% to down 2% to down 6% sequentially. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on turns rate of approximately 51%.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 69% to 70%. Operating expenses for the September quarter are expected to be approximately $217 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. As I mentioned last quarter, Q1 OpEx would be at the low point for the year. The increase in Q2 OpEx will be driven primarily by hiring in the sales force, an increase tape-out expense related primarily to the 16 nanometer technology generation.","Other income and expense for the September quarter will be a net expense of $10 million. The share count is expected to be roughly 268 million shares. The tax rate for September quarter is expected to be approximately 12%. The reset of our tax rate guidance to 12% is due to a change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Though the June quarter was challenging from topline perspective, we continue to be pleased with our focus on delivering sustained type of stability. Gross margin was 70.9% better than expectations, driving an operating margin of 32.5%.","28 nanometer revenue decline as we anticipated, driven by weakness in wireless communication. However sales from our Zynq product family, the industry\u2019s first All Programmable SoC increased more than 40%. The primary driver for this growth came from ADAS applications. Important industry growth driver ideally suited to benefit from the Zynq product family\u2019s innovative and differentiated capabilities.","We expect 20 nanometer sales to return to growth in September quarter driven by continued sales increase from the Zynq product as well as an increase in wired communication. Additionally, we\u2019re forecasting 28 nanometer revenue to grow for the balance of fiscal year 2016, driven by demand stabilization and communications, continued strong adoption in Automotive, ISM, Test and Aerospace and Defense.","We\u2019re also executing very well with our 20 nanometer Ultrascale portfolio. Technology leadership at this node is very rapidly translating to sales leadership. We have now shipped 20 nanometer parts to more than 140 discrete customers in all of our major end markets.","20 nanometer revenue in June quarter doubled sequentially more than $10 million with significant growth coming from Virtex Ultrascale, the industry's only ASIC class 20 nanomenter high-end product offering. The September quarter, we\u2019re forecasting 20 nanometer sales to exceed $15 million for experiencing a sales ramp that is more accelerated than our initial expectations.","We estimate our share at this node in approaching 80%, confident of share of 20 nanometer will continue to exceed 65% market share we have delivered at 28 nanometer. The 16 nanometer node, we taped out the industry's first All Programmable Multiprocessor SoC using TSMC\u2019s 16FF class process. This product family targets applications in embedded vision including ADAS, Industrial Internet-of-things beside two wireless systems.","During the June quarter, we also extended our world class partnership with TSMC, the undisputed leader in the foundry industry with the announcement that we will be leveraging TSMC\u2019s 7 nanometer processed technology, 3D IC technology for our next generation of All Programmable FPGAs, 3D ICs and MPSoCs.","Technology represents the fourth consecutive generation where the two companies have partnered advanced process and cohort backing technology and will become TSMC's fourth generation of FinFET technology. We anticipate the first tape-out at 7 nanometer at full year 2017.","Finally, with regard to design software, earlier this week, we announced the public access release of our SDSoC development environment to expand the user base of Zynq SoCs and MPSoCs to a broad community of systems and software engineers, both existing in new market.","Despite weak global communications spending environment, I remain very confident in Xilinx\u2019s strong technology leadership and market expansion initiatives driven by existing and new SDx software designed development environment. We will continue to focus on maintaining high levels of profitability in any business environment with the overall goal of maximizing shareholder.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.","Ross Seymore","Hi guys. Moshe, a bigger picture question for you, similar to what we\u2019ve been asking linear attack. What is your view on what's going on with overall demand being weaker than expected whether by geography and market or whatever you believe the cause to be. And do you think that is more of a short-term pause or something that's a little more longer in duration?","Moshe Gavrielov","We see the weakness primarily in wireless and it\u2019s being choppy and less predictable than we had thought it would be for some time now. And as a result, we\u2019re very hesitant to call when the visibility will improve there. We do think it\u2019s a question of when, not a question of if but it has shrunk by significant amount. And if you compare where we were a year ago to where we are now, I think it\u2019s several tens of percent lower. So that\u2019s the major market of vertical where we think issues. On the other areas, I wouldn\u2019t say that they are buoyant and vibrant and doing great but they are sort of holding out for us. So that\u2019s the Xilinx\u2019s perspective. Jon, to you, concur.","Jon Olson","Yeah. I do concur. I would also add to that, that our share position is particularly in the wireless segment. It is still very strong. I think that helps bolster our confidence that when these things do come back, we are going to be a strong participant of that. And as I said, it\u2019s very hard to get exactly what the trajectory of the second half improvement is. And we see signs and positive statement from both customers and carriers but we\u2019re going quarter-by-quarter right now in this particular end market.","Ross Seymore","Great. Thank you very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from William Stein with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. William Stein, your line is open.","William Stein","Sorry. I was muted. Thanks for taking my question. The negative outlook in the industrial end market where you are citing ending of a program in Aerospace and Defense, was there sort of last-time buy that was associated with that, that was going on recently and then I have a follow-up please?","Jon Olson","Well, this is part of the announced program where the joint strike -- specific with the Joint Strike Fighter where there is a very large set of purchases going on over a period of a year and a half to two years and this is just the -- essentially the end of that particular procurement and they are redesigning some of the key elements into electronics inside the aircraft and as I said, we are winning all the redesigns.","It is just that there is this gap between when the older designs, materials being acquired versus the new periods. So, we are the end of that particular program and we won\u2019t see any significant revenue shift into that program for the remainder of this year. So, I wouldn\u2019t associate it wholly with any sort of a last-time buy situation.","William Stein","Thanks. And then the follow-up is a much broader question. Competitively when you talk to customers, I\u2019d love to hear about sort of positioning the company does relative to your competitor is soon likely to be owned by Intel, whether that changes the dynamic and how so, both on the relationship side and then the anticipated manufacturing change that might happen at that supplier?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Well, let me take it. So, fundamentally, if you look at the markets we service there highly diversified markets that look for eights months technology and a significant level of support with a very long lifecycle. And this is a market we have serviced really well. We continue to service it well. We have delivered market share expansion of 28-nanometer.","We\u2019ve seen that expand to better position the 20. We believe we are ahead of the game now being the first to tape-out at the node beyond that 16 and we are already working with TSMC on the 7-nanometer and we expect to tape out in the 2017 timeframe. So on the silicon side, the customers are very sure that they will continue to have the same level of excellence in terms of technology leadership and a timeliness and that\u2019s an opportunity for us. Now when you supplement that with the leadership we have on the software and expansion with the new product, the SDAccel and the SDSoC, which we have now are broadly, are making available to customers and not only is it the best silicon but it\u2019s the best software in the industry and the best support infrastructure in the industry.","So, we actually believe that this is an opportunity for us and I would say the customers are reassured by that. And we know that we are the biggest and have been for the longest period of time, the leader and the bellwether player in this market. So, we remain committed to it and together with our unique relationship with TSMC and Avnet, we will continue to get the best products around the further requirement. So, the market will rollover, we don\u2019t know what will happen on the other side. I think generally speaking, this bodes well for us and that\u2019s why our interest -- continued interest heavily to make sure we can exploit this opportunity.","William Stein","Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you","Operator","The next question is from Chris Danely with Citi.","Chris Danely","Hey, guys. Now that the Altera doubling is officially official, I guess I can stop asking my hypothetical questions and ask some real questions. So are you seeing any reaction from your customers on that and then Intel talked about a delay in 10-nanometers. How do you think that positions Altera versus yourselves?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, I'm not sure I can handle what I said before. We're focused on delivering leadership on silicon, on software in terms of support and we are working with TSMC and with ARM on the next-generation products. And we now have announced 7-nanometer tape out and TSMC and ARMS will be available 2017 and we expect to tape out at that point in time.","So, we are focused on execution and all of the uncertainty with regards to the Altera acquisition by Intel. I think that's generally an opportunity for us as long as we continue to execute and deliver. And since we've done that at 28 and our results speak for themselves, the results of 20 are already demonstrating even better market share for us. We will first succeed and working on 7, I think as we continue to execute, there is upside for us from all of the uncertainty.","Chris Danely","Has there been any reaction from the customers?","Moshe Gavrielov","The customers are generally happy that they have the bellwether in the largest company in the business, continued focus on this mode of business, right. And I think it\u2019s a wait and see for them with regards to see what will happen on the other side, right. But we're around. We are open for business and we are committed and continued to be committed to delivering the leadership, both on the technology and the support side.","Chris Danely","Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.","Ryan Goodman","Hey. This is Ryan Goodman from Srini. I get another one for you on Intel and Altera? So now with that kind of in the works, I'm curious if you see any need to maybe go out and get access through a partnership or maybe start working in-house on a customer onboard just to stay competitive in terms of potential integration advantages that Intel may have with Altera overtime.","Moshe Gavrielov","So that\u2019s a great question. And we were first the 28 with rank. We were first at 16 with our MPSoC product, which actually has a very attractive performance level and we believe that for most of the markets we are addressing, ARM is actually by far the best solution. I could say that the one potential exception to data is the data center market.","But the data center market is likely to bifurcate into Intel and the rest of the world and so the rest of the world, we believe we are going to be the natural and best solution. So, there's upside for us there and we think we can do it with the ARM product roadmap and with the TSMC process and we\u2019ve already demonstrated that.","There is a lot of cluster about the leadership that Intel would deliver to Altera. The fact is we already had -- with regards to that node. So, we believe that we are in good shape both strategically and tactically, and definitely the on roadmap will suffice knowing.","If you\u2019re asking a very specific question, could there be markets where fully optimized x86 solution provides some advantage? The answer to that is yes, there are some markets. It tends to be a small subset of the overall market. And we think for most of the market, we will have a very adequate and competitive solution using our existing roadmap.","Ryan Goodman","Okay. Great. Thanks. And I just want to follow up on the financial model. You had hinted in the prepared comments that the wireless issues are kind of challenging. Your prior targets were flat, up 2% for the fiscal year. So just curious if there is anything else to add there if you\u2019re providing an actual update there. And also on the OpEx side too, I think you had a forecast out there, just maybe an update on how that\u2019s tracking? Thanks.","Jon Olson","Yes. So at this time, we aren\u2019t going to go quarter by quarter. The wireless as I said on the previous answer as well, it\u2019s really hard to understand what the pace of the change, the trajectory is on China and the US, specifically the Chinese base station rollout and more specifically Sprint for us, which was one of our leading growth sectors in North America. I mean, Verizon and AT&T are also involved, but Sprint was certainly one of the leading growth sectors there.","So we are not giving a new number for the full year just because of the challenge of understanding what that really means to us. So meaning how strong will it come back, will it come back in the second half, all those things, really hard for us to say. So we aren\u2019t putting out a new number. Spending, we revised spending downward in our last call vis-\u00e0-vis what we said at Investor Day and we aren\u2019t changing that forecast this time.","Ryan Goodman","Okay. Thanks.","Rick Muscha","Okay. Thank you. Next question?","Operator","The next question is from Ian Ing with MKM Partners.","Ian Ing","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A bit early a $10 million of revenue per quarter, but can you talk about 20 nanometers, perhaps yields, execution, volume ramps, as it compares to 28 nanometers?","Moshe Gavrielov","That\u2019s the great question, Ian. So if you look at 28, it was a very, very, very broad node and there is a low end, the midrange, high end, those the same product line which ended up with the large number of product. From our perspective, the 20 and 16 together which are coming out relatively close, closer than typical should more or less be equivalent to 28. So 20 is not as big as 28, but neither that we expect to be and 20 is now benefiting from the fact we have high end and midrange there.","And that\u2019s what is generating this level of revenue, but there is no low end and then there is no Zynq equivalent on the 20-nanometer. Hence, overall, it\u2019s not as vibrant as 28 as well, but on the other hand it\u2019s doing better than we had expected. So we are quite pleased with the results so far and the pickup in terms of design wins, which are now rapidly turning into revenues were encouraging from my perspective.","Ian Ing","Great. And for my follow-up, I mean how much do you think Xilinx\u2019s customers are seeing price increases year-to-date, whether it\u2019s deliberate value-based pricing or the strong dollar overseas and what\u2019s the response has been? I know Avnet as early as June said there is really no impact to the strong dollar. I was just wanted to check in on that.","Jon Olson","Yes. I certainly have not seen much impact to the stronger dollar. Of course, it\u2019s pulled back a little bit now, but we really haven\u2019t. I thought I sensed the pause in our industrial business in Europe a few quarters back, but then it\u2019s bounced back the next quarter, I mean it\u2019s stable now. And it\u2019s got some growth going on there. So we really haven\u2019t seen anything there overall. So yes, generally, I think things are not being impacted on a worldwide basis because of the currency strength for us.","Ian Ing","Thank you.","Rick Muscha","Thanks, Ian. Next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Christopher Rolland with FBR Capital Markets.","Joe Gallo","Hey, guys. This is Joe on for Chris. Thanks for letting me ask the question. So you\u2019ve really recently been promoting Zynq for ADAS and Embedded Vision, but there is one clear winner in Embedded Vision and it appears they are using ASIC approach. So what gives you confidence there that there will be a gravitation toward FPGAs and who are your earlier design wins there?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Well, we are very confident because we have design wins and we have models that are going into production. And I think there is already 12 and it could be that the number is slightly higher that are already 12 models that are going into production at this point in time with our solution.","And we don\u2019t have the plurality of the market, it\u2019s a market which is emerging, but we believe that it\u2019s a great starting point for us and it\u2019s helping to drive our business. And for everyone who is looking for a differentiated solution as opposed to a cookie cutter solution, which will give you -- which won\u2019t give you an advantage, then we are the train to ride with that regard.","We think more and more of the customers adopt our solution. I don\u2019t think we are going to have 50% market share this generation, but we are already garnering tremendous number of design wins with the MPSoC for the follow-on for that. So we are very pleased with the market share with the Zynq product offering and we expect that to expand with the MPSoC market, which is in its infancy. And I think that it\u2019s still too early to assume that there is only going to be one winner, we expect to be a significant winner in this market.","Joe Gallo","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up. I know back to the 16-nanometer tape-out, I know there is a press release recently about taping out a program a little multi-processor 16-nanometer chip. What else are you close to taping out on 16-nanometer and how should we think about the progression of products that node will be high end first and midrange and how should we think about that?","Moshe Gavrielov","Well, the 16-nanometer offering is quite broad and it has a midrange, high end and very extensive processor roadmap, so that\u2019s the MPSoC. So it covers probably 80%, or 70% to 80% of the total area that we tend to play and it doesn\u2019t cover the very low end. We will be -- we feel we had good coverage with the 28 and 45-nanometer solution at the low end and we will be bolstering that low end portfolio in the future with the new generation of technology, but that\u2019s what -- this has been taped out.","The initial product is a relatively high end product with an embedded processor, but it\u2019s not the ultimate high end. It\u2019s sort of just on the same between the midrange and the high end of the product offering. And we are going to continue to expand going up and down. And the first version does has embedded CPU core and that will be the first one which will come out we will have, is targeted to have the embedded CPU core and that has a tremendous level of interest in the market.","Jon Olson","And other additional tape out as we move through the year. I mean this was just the first tape out as we\u2019ve wound down our 20-nanometer tape out focus and getting all those outer markets and 16 comes right behind it and they\u2019ll continue to have tape out throughout the rest of remainder of this year and to the following fiscal year.","Joe Gallo","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Market.","Kulin Patel","Hi. It\u2019s Kulin Patel for Ambrish. Thanks for taking my question. I have question on earlier you mentioned that you plan to introduce 7-nanometer products in 2017. This implies that just to your gap between tape out for 15 and 7, are you skipping 10-nanometer and if it any reason why you are skipping 10-nanometer?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So if you look at the sequence, there is 28 and then 20 and 16 came out in rapid session. And there was actually two flavors of 16, there was 16FF and the 16FF+. So we -- after we did the 20 we decided to skip the 16FF and go straight to the FF+. With the gap between 7 and 10 at TSMC actually is quite significant in terms of the capabilities of the two products.","And from our perspective, our customers can only digest technology of the certain cadence. If we bring out the technology every three months, that\u2019s not going to help them. So to some extent the somewhere between every two to three years to have a major technology refresh for the business we\u2019re in is the right cadence.","And what we decided to do is to shoot for the best technology, which will be available in that\u2019s sort of timeframe. And because of 7-nanometer fits the bill and its lower power and denser and actually higher performance, we felt it was better to do that than to split between the 10 and the 7. So that sort of the depth of the thinking and we\u2019re quite confident that this is the right decision in terms of our customer requirements.","Kulin Patel","Great. Thanks, guys.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Vivek Arya with BofA."," ","Hi. This is [Shankar] [ph] on behalf of Vivek. So I just want to dig into the wireless weakness. So they are going to sign up a letter. They have been adding a lot of these subscribers. So the real reason for the weakness is that excess inventory or you think customers are using more ASICs, ASSP as well as FPGA like before? And what do you think will turn this around for you in the long run?","Jon Olson","Well, the answers are different by geography to that question. Really isn\u2019t the same. The transits of China in general has been stalled out both because the SD standard deployment, which is one of the bigger thing that was -- we were counting on for this year to actually began and be more robust as we move through the year. That was stalled out originally by China Unicom and China Telecom.","The audits that they had relative to ethics and those kinds of things they were on. There has been an overall slowdown of capital spend in China and infrastructure, which is more of a macro thing going on relative to the China issue. So I think that\u2019s been the biggest driver there and there absolutely has been a build-up of base station inventory and our product in the Chinese suppliers that is being let off as China Mobile continues to deploy at a much lower rate than the previous year but China Unicom and China telecom not as much.","So if you -- people have told me that if you\u2019re in China and you using one of those handsets from the China Mobile network, there is still a lot of coverage issues. So a lot things are left to be done there. So I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s driven by the subscriber poll. I think there are some bigger issues going on there. Relative to North America, it\u2019s kind of bifurcated into Sprint who is also having some financial issues in terms of funding their network, so they slowed down the deployment of their network.","And they\u2019ve gone through a rebating process and that process has been completed as best as we can tell. And so again, we think that because of those milestones, we think things are going to start to turnaround and grow for us in the second half of this year and into calendar 2016. AT&T and Verizon have slowed down their cap spending in the first part of the year. There was Spectrum acquisition.","They also are trying to spend a little more money now and those are going to be additional capacitization of that network. So it really is different by different carriers and geography. The thought process about what\u2019s going to turn this around for us is just exactly the fact that subscriber and coverage is not uniformly sufficient and good in those geographies. The thought process about what\u2019s going to turn this around for us is just exactly the fact that subscriber and coverage is not uniformly sufficient and good in those geographies.","And as Moshe said earlier, it's a matter of when. It's not a matter of if for us. And again, we\u2019ve seen positive press coming out of carriers relative to some improvement in that. We\u2019ve seen orders turn with respect to India, some growth there. So, we have some specific orders ahead of us on that. So, we are starting to see some positive signs that would lead us to believe that the second half of fiscal year will be better."," ","Great. So, I have one follow-up. So, on the data center side, actually the Exadata opportunity was a prime reason why Intel acquired Altera. Can you talk about how big the market is for you? Is it still an area of focus and is Intel acquiring Altera, they some how going to come over to optimize product that can even say knock you out of the market? Can you just give some color around the data center object?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. So the various element to the data center and there is elements that focus on storage, elements that focus on networking and elements that focus on compute. So the storage and networking are largely unimpacted by this acquisition. And in compute space, it\u2019s very clear that FPGAs provide a viable, very attractive lower-power solution, which significantly provide an improvement in the performance per watt by -- what we're seeing is somewhere between 20x to 30x in several applications, vis-\u00e0-vis standalone, high performance processor.","And that\u2019s because these applications in the cloud tend to be massively parallel and these processors are inherently not parallel engines, they\u2019re very sequential. That\u2019s the way a CPU operates. And even if you have multiple CPU cores, you can only achieve a certain level as parallel as in that way. So, FPGAs actually can provide tremendous acceleration at the same platform or lower power consumption just to make sure, or they can provide at a much lower level of power consumption, they can deliver equivalent performance.","Now we believe that when Intel consummates its acquisition, when that happens then there will be some integration opportunity. The challenge there is that you are taking a very high power solution, which is an x86 and you are adding to it another high power solution, which is a large FPGA. And to some extent you try to integrate both of those on same silicon and you are limited with regards to what you can do.","So we believe that that market, the Intel x86 will have an element which will have an integrated solution and they will have an element which has these distributed solutions where the FPGA will be separate.","And we see a lot of the traditional Data Center customers having a strong interest in actually retaining autonomy and independent in that second node, so they can decide how they design their system and obviously, would be a wonderful solution for that.","So even in the Intel x86 space we believe we have a play. And not mentioned that everywhere where it\u2019s not Intel and this is a market which is emerging, right. So there is a lot of competing solutions that will come to the market over the next few years. We will be the natural show in for that -- for those solutions.","So I would say there is upside for us definitely vis-\u00e0-vis beyond where we are today and we are committed to that market and we expect to see business growth in that market and we believe that market is it -- in its very early stages and of evolution and overtime we will have a stronger position in it than we definitely have now. So hopefully that answers your question? I apologies it was more than you wanted to hear on that topic?"," ","No. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you. Next question?","Operator","The next question is from Tristan Gerra with Robert W. Baird.","Tristan Gerra","Hi. Good afternoon. Just as a quick follow to the Data Center question and answer that you\u2019ve just provided, which was very useful? How competitive you said you are relative to Altera now with software and OpenCL which I believe was the reason for the delay initially in you getting in that end-market?","Moshe Gavrielov","Yes. To be total honest, we were not -- we did not recognized that market earlier. On the software side we did have product efficiency. Now based on what customers are telling us, not only are we not behind but we are actually ahead of the competition.","So I think we have largely closed that gap and if anything it is a competitive advantage for us. We believe that the very deep synthesis technology that we have now delivered this part of our [indiscernible] product that give us a tremendous advantage over any other solution in the market today.","As with product size update we are now starting to broadly deliver it to customer. We -- and the feedback we are getting is that we are ahead in terms of technology. So the software is no longer the issue if anything is working in our favor.","Tristan Gerra","Okay. That\u2019s very useful. And then just a quick follow-up. Is there any end of life product headwind embedded in your September quarter guidance?","Jon Olson","No. there isn\u2019t.","Tristan Gerra","Great. Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thanks. Next question?","Operator","The next question is from James Covello with Goldman Sachs.","Gabriela Borges","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Gabriela Borges on behalf of Jim. Just want to follow-up on all the challenges that have been articulated in the Wireless market? Curious if its changing the way you are thinking about providing quarter-to-quarter forecast as well, maybe handicapping customer forecast more than normal? And I guess, the other question would be how that reflects into the turns rate that\u2019s embedded in guidance, given that this was a transition towards distributors or distribution transition as well? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Hi, Gabriela. It is certainly a challenge in, I will say, any markets where we have a very high concentration and there has -- in this particularly situation it seems to be more of a worldwide trend that\u2019s going on and if you look at other semiconductor companies have the same challenges as we do in this area.","I don\u2019t think, because we have such a diversified portfolio beyond just Wireless and overall Communications. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to cause us to change our -- it\u2019s our desire to try -- to do a forecast and do the best way possibly we can.","I think we are at a point here of certainly a multiyear historical low for us in terms of revenue and -- in this segment and it is challenging but, I think, we will continue to try to push through and figure this out.","Now relative to the turns percentage number that I provided, while it was quite a bit higher on a percentage basis than our actual turns from the previous quarter, I think we\u2019ve been relatively conservative on the wireless forecast to support that. We had quite a bit of business booked early in the quarter, the previous quarter and then moving into this current quarter that we just started, we\u2019re back to a more normal booking pattern.","And the actual dollars we need in terms on a weekly basis is not that much greater than the actual dollars per week we had in the previous quarter. So I think we\u2019re pretty well balanced and we see how things go throughout the quarter.","Gabriela Borges","Appreciate all the color. Maybe just as a follow-up if I could on the gross margin profile of the business, maybe if we think about year-over-year how the gross margin profile of the company has changed. Help us understand how much of that is makeshift either between end markets or between different product groups? I mean, how much of it is structural initiatives that the company has been taking to improve the longer term gross margin profile? Thank you.","Jon Olson","Yeah. So at our Investor Day, we talked about it a 68% to 70% range for this year. So if you look at the midpoint, that would be 69%. And we\u2019ve been running at 70% and 71%. So all the cost reductions that we had in that forecasted Investor Day that drove the 68% to 70% are on track and we\u2019re doing very well. So I would say if I compare it to our previous forecast, we\u2019re on track on all the cost reductions.","There is a lot of mix issues going on. We do have a slightly stronger Industrial, Aerospace and Defense profile than we thought at that point in time. And we had a substantially weaker communications business. And that mix would tend to push our gross margins to this very high elevated point that we are right now.","So I think both product and customer mix is accounting for quite a bit. Of this, I think in the absence of more normal -- normalized end market mix that we would have envisioned at the Investor Day, we\u2019ll be running in the 68% to 70% range, probably pretty close to the center of that. So I guess, the short answer to your question is, a lot of it is product mix and end market customer mix.","Gabriela Borges","Understood. Thank you very much.","Rick Muscha","Okay. Thank you. Next question.","Operator","The next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","Charles Kazarian","Hi guys. Charles Kazarian here on behalf on John. Not sure if this was addressed or not but I know you commented that Industrial, Aero, Defense was better than expected on ISM and A&D. I was just hoping if you talk a little more about Industrial within this bucket, for example, what you\u2019re seeing with end demand and then also your view on inventory today in going forward into the back half of the year?","Jon Olson","Yeah. Industrial, as we stated, our Industrial was a record quarterly revenue for us, had very strong contribution in North America and in Asia-Pac to be very specific on that. We\u2019re starting to see growth of the Zynq microprocessor-based FPGA in our numbers and broadly new applications in motor control connected factories, industrial, IOT, kinds of areas. We\u2019re starting to see those designs that we\u2019ve won over the last couple of years, start to accumulate in revenue.","So while I know, there has been some challenging statements about the industrial market. Overall, we saw -- we started to see some of the positive things we\u2019ve been talking about over the last year or so, start to mount up and be more significant within our numbers in addition to our traditional areas.","Charles Kazarian","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Rick Muscha","Next question?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Hans Mosesmann with Raymond James.","Hans Mosesmann","Thank you. Hey, Moshe, I\u2019m looking at the roadmaps here. It turns out that by my reckoning in 2018, you guys are going to be ramping or very early ramping 7-nanometer. And if Altera chooses or if Intel chooses to be the provider of foundry services for Altera there will be a 10. Was there a competitive reasoning behind your decision to skip 10-nanometer besides the cadence aspect of your customers\u2019 preference?","Moshe Gavrielov","Not really, that\u2019s great question. We just looked at what the right solution -- everything what was available to us and what would be the right solution and TSMC had their 10 and then we said well, there anything beyond that and they told us that they were working on this future technology. TSMC is very committed to driving technology and capacity leadership and when we saw what it is, we thought that it would be a no compelling and so just based on that. Now indirectly, we have no idea what Altera and Intel were going to do and Altera had said that they were looking at TSMC\u2019s roadmap and I would be surprised if TSMC did roadshows on the same thing to be on the strike with that. Probably just makes sense for TSMC to show what they have. So it wasn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know what was available at Intel, but we just decided that the right thing for our customer base was to go to a 7-nanomter and that looks like a very compelling solution in particular as they are committed to delivering it in 2017 and that\u2019s when we needed.","Hans Mosesmann","Right. Okay. And if I could a follow-on on the Zynq side. In the automotive models that you are in, do you know if you are in the front-facing cameras? Is Zynq being used in that kind of an application within a car?","Moshe Gavrielov","Absolutely. Absolutely.","Hans Mosesmann","Okay. And what image processing software, do you provide that or is that a third-party?","Moshe Gavrielov","It comes from a variety of sources. Some of which are internal to us, some of which come from that the customers provide and in some cases, it\u2019s the third-party which provides them. So it\u2019s a combination of all three.","Just to sort of comment on that, what we\u2019re seeing and I said this in response to an early question, we are seeing customers look at a non-differentiated ASSP solution versus highly differentiated solution using our devices. And for the high end, it\u2019s a no-brainer that they wanted differentiated solution.","And then as you look at the midrange, it\u2019s less clear and definitely, it\u2019s a low end time save and just prepare to have a meat and potato solution as opposed to something which is more specialized. But interestingly because this is become a platform play, then we are starting to see design wins where the customers are committing their entire product offering to our platform. And as a result, they are pushing us hard to provide them with a lower end and we typically would have provided or solution for that.","And so that\u2019s a growth opportunity for us. And it\u2019s driven by this broad platform-oriented approach where the companies are sort of saying we can\u2019t afford to have different solutions. And because we want to have differentiation, they go with us across the board. And that\u2019s another reason that I believe that our market share which we are happy with the revenue at this point, but our market share is not high yet. We believe that there is an opportunity to grow it going forward.","Hans Mosesmann","Thank you. Very helpful.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Sure. Thank you.","Jon Olson","Operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We will provide a financial and business review of the March quarter and then open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available and that actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important risk factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon A. Olson","Thank you, Rick. Fiscal year 2013 was highlighted by sales growth from our new products, which increased more than 80% from the prior year, driving PLD share gains for the year. Although muted macroeconomic conditions contributed to an overall sales decline of 3%, Xilinx achieved a record gross margin in fiscal 2013. Gross margin of 66% was an increase from 65% in the prior fiscal year, a direct result of our continued focus on margin expansion projects across our product portfolio.","In the March quarter, Xilinx sales were $532 million, up 4% sequentially and at the midpoint of the guidance we've provided. Sales from all geographies, with the exception of Japan, increased sequentially. Gross margin was 66.1%.","Operating expenses of $204 million including amortization were $4 million lower than expected, due primarily to lower discretionary, sales-related and litigation expense.","New product sales increased 13% sequentially, with particularly strong growth from Kintex-7 and Virtex-7 FPGAs. 28-nanometer product sales exceeded $40 million in the quarter, surpassing our previously stated goal of greater than $30 million.","Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Sales from communications and data center decreased 1% sequentially. This was slightly weaker than we had forecasted. We had expected this sector to be up slightly, driven primarily by wired communications. The actual results were driven by a decline in wired customers, primarily on older products. New products, however, were up sequentially. The decline in wired was partially offset by wireless customers shipping both 3G and LTE technologies on a global basis. We continue to expect TD-LTE business to be a significant sales contributor in the second half of the calendar year.","Industrial, aerospace and defense sales increased 7% sequentially, with strengths from all 3 subcategories. Broadcast, consumer and automotive was stronger than anticipated, with double-digit percentage growth from all 3 subcategories.","Other income and expense was a net expense of $9 million, $2 million higher than planned, primarily due to impairment losses on private equity investments.","Net income for the quarter was $131 million or $0.47 per diluted share and included a tax benefit of $12 million or $0.04 per diluted share as a result of a catch-up benefit related to the restatement of the R&D -- reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","Operating cash flow for the December quarter was $174 million before $6 million in CapEx. We paid $58 million in cash dividends during the quarter.","Diluted shares for the quarter were 277 million. There was a 9.4 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes. For questions relating to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments were flat at approximately $3.4 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt, and our net cash position is approximately $2.1 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased 2 days in the March quarter to 39 days.","Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $25 million sequentially. Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution were 110 days, down from 131 days in the prior quarter. We expect inventory dollars to be down again in the June quarter as we work toward a target of 90 to 100 days of combined inventory.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal '14. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting continued growth from our new products. From an end market perspective, we expect communications to be approximately flat as wired increases offset wireless decreases.","We expect industrial and aerospace and defense to be up slightly as growth from industrial, scientific & medical and test & measurement are offset by declines in defense. Lastly, we expect broadcast, consumer and automotive to be up, driven by increases in both consumer and automotive.","As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 1% to 5% sequentially, with sales from all geographies expected to be flat to up, with the exception of Europe, which is expected to be down. The midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 54%, which is lower than the prior quarter but in line with our 4 year average.","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 66% to 67%. Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $206 million, including $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. We remain comfortable with the full year operating expense guidance we provided at our recent investor meeting.","Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 277 million shares. And the tax rate for the June quarter is expected to be approximately 13% to 14%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. The 4% sequential sales growth in the March quarter was driven by double-digit increases on 6 of our secondary end markets. This broad-based strength highlights recovery in our business. Revenue was primarily driven by exceptional growth from our 28-nanometer product family, which exceeded $40 million, significantly surpassing our expectations. 28-nanometer sales were driven by both our midrange Kintex-7 and our high-performance Virtex-7 product families.","We are now converting technology leadership to revenue growth. 28-nanometer Xilinx is a generation ahead of our competition in 4 areas. We have the broadest portfolio with our all programmable FPGAs, SoCs and 3D ICs. Second, we have the best products with an extra node of performance, lower power, high levels of integration and connectivity with the industry's absolutely best service.","Third, and per our customers, critically more importantly, as our average design complexity has skyrocketed, we enable the highest productivity with Vivado, the industry's first SoC-strength tool suite. This enables delivering unmatched time to integration and implementation and, by far, the best quality of results, i.e. higher density, higher performance and lower power.  Lastly, we enabled smarter systems with the unique combination of SmartCORE IP, C-based design tools and libraries, embedded software running on our market-defining ARM-based solutions.","Leveraging all 4 advantages, revenue growth is already being driven by continued PLD share gains, considerable displacement of ASICs and ASSPs, aggressive market penetration and core target growth driver applications. Smarter 100-gig wired networks, wireless HetNets, data centers, retail and vision-based systems.","In the March quarter, we announced multiple industry first, the 20-nanometer, clearly demonstrating between our -- this node to staying a generation ahead. Vivado Tool Suite now supports 20-nanometer designs. We are currently working with numerous Early Access customers. We'll be taping out our first 20-nanometer device this quarter as predicted.","The rollout of our 7 Series and Zynq All Programmable SoC product generation is nearly complete with all 5 families in production. Fiscal year 2013, 28-nanometer sales comfortably surpassed $100 million. Over 500 customers receiving shipments in the March quarter alone in a broad base of applications including communications, industrial, defense and broadcast.","In the June quarter, we expect our 20-nanometer shipment -- 28-nanometer shipments to, again, exceed $14 million in sales. As we discussed at our Analyst Day last month, we are very confident 28-nanometer sales will grow to more than $250 million in fiscal year 2014.","With an improving demand environment, industry's broadest and, by far, best 28-nanometer portfolio, focusing penetration into the highest growth applications and significant progress in displacing ASICs and ASSPs, the new fiscal year promises to be an exciting year for Xilinx, here, where we will clearly connect technology leadership to revenue and demonstrate we're a generation ahead for accelerated growth.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Jon, in your prepared comments, you talked about a meaningful uptick expected in the back half of the calendar year for TD-LTE. The LTE cycle has been one that investors have been waiting for, for a while. I guess what gives you the confidence in the TD-LTE market? And if you could also just discuss the kind of the LTE build-out here in the developed countries. We saw AT&T kind of lower their CapEx for the out years. When do we start to see kind of the content pickup story for you guys within that spend?","Jon A. Olson","Sure, John. So let's just talk about the TD-LTE portion first and I'll go to the second half after that. So we get -- the information we get is primarily from our customers. And the customers in China who are providing, or are the likely candidates to provide that equipment have given us forecasts that indicate in the second half we're going to have a -- the beginning of the ramp for that design. We have already sold into equipment where they're kind of doing their booked prototyping and their first-generation of testing of that capital equipment. And so I'm just putting these 2 things together. They're forecast for the second half of the year now, of course, these aren't binding forecasts, these aren't orders that are booked and all is subject to change. But usually what we've seen is the beginning of the prototype build followed within a quarter or 2 of the ramp. So the combination of their forecast, which means there must be some confidence that they want us to build enough parts for that as well as the beginning of prototypes is where I'm getting that information. The second question or maybe Moshe, do you have any additional color on the LTE before I...","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, China is expected to happen in the second half, and all of the signals highlight that, that is the plan and is ongoing.","Jon A. Olson","Okay. The AT&T announcement is kind of interesting. We obviously are pretty aware of that, of what was said. But when you peel back the onion of what's inside there and we have talked to the carrier about this, their program is associated with wireless rollout of LTE. Actually, it's preserved in terms of the kind of ramp they've been talking about in terms of capital spend and deployment across the country for the rest of this year and into next calendar year. So it's a very specific name to that program and we've gone and talked to them and checked with that. And our best information is, is that the wireless LTE portion of this is not substantially impacted by the statements that they made.","John W. Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And maybe as my follow-up, guys, just quickly, another good quarter on the gross margin line, without yet seeing, I think, the benefit of some of the share gains you're expecting in 28-nanometer. I guess, given your leadership position is at 28, as that becomes a bigger mix of the overall revenue stream, is there opportunities to kind of get the margins above the higher end of your target, given that there's still a gap between yourselves and your closest competitor?","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So there's no question we are continuing to do everything we possibly can to move the margin number up. The fact that we haven't changed our business model, I kind of anticipate the question on that as well. The fact that we haven't changed our business model is not really important relative to our view in the short term that we do think margins are going to continue to be healthy. I think one of the things we've talked about at the Investor Day was around the increasing importance of Zynq against ASSPs. And we're still working through those kinds of competitive situations. And in terms of changing our business model, I think we're just being cautious. But there's no doubt in the short run, as evidenced by our forecast for the June quarter, we are confident that margins have drifted up and continue to drift up a little bit if you go back over the last 6 quarters and plot it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","One more on gross margin. One thing that Altera has done, had these products customized for different applications, i.e. with cost optimal structures, some of it in high-k metal gate, some without. And they have often explained that, that's the reason that their gross margins have tended to be higher. Is that a valid reason? Is that the kind of gap that you can close through your own design activity? Or do you think there is that structural gap that will remain?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So we have, over the past 5 years since the new management team has been in place, we've focused on improving the gross margins. And we believe that with the unquestionably superior portfolio we have and the broader portfolio we have and the deeper portfolio we have, we will get -- we audit for that and there is now the operational focus on driving defect densities and making sure that the overall portfolio has the right mix. So there's various ways of addressing it, and we like the way we've addressed it. It gives us technology leadership, market leadership and, unquestionably, a strong position. So I wouldn't say there's only one way to address it and the results speak for themselves. Ours have floated up. And despite the fact that we're now shipping a lot of 28-nanometer, the margins have gone higher rather than lower, which typically in the past it would go the other way when we are introducing a new generation of product. So -- but fundamentally, I believe that our overall portfolio strategy at 28 is absolutely winning and superior at this point.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And as a follow-up, there's some frequent concerns that the large Chinese equipment vendor has been trying to actively use more of their internal ASICs. I know it's not a new concern but it does come up frequently, and the related concern to that is that maybe for this initial prototyping part of PBLT, they might be using more PLDs. But as they go forward, that they might try to use more of an internal ASIC solution. Can you put that concern to bed once and for all, because I think that has -- it just comes up so frequently?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, we are confident that we have tailored our Kintex product to be absolutely a perfect solution for those wireless requirements. And what does happen is for the first few years, things change quite a bit, and the flexibility inherent in the FPGA is fundamentally a big feature that enables them to address that. And so between the flexibility they need and the very strong match that we have with our product offering to their requirements, and Kintex was targeted specifically at that, then I think we have a very strong position. Now any of our customers at any point in time can decide to do this. It typically is a risky, lengthy and complex thing to do, and it does happen from time to time. It just is becoming rarer and rarer. And so the number of companies that can do it has dropped. And even at the biggest names, and you've alluded to one of them, where they do undoubtedly have capacity, they tend to want to use it strategically where it has the biggest impact, and that biggest impact actually tends to be more on the consumer side where they have huge volumes and very short product life where they can exploit that most effectively. So I would never say never. I'm just saying it's more difficult and we're intent on making it more and more challenging as we move forward to advance nodes at the fastest pace possible.","Jon A. Olson","And we're seeing no signs of this activity. So I mean, again, it could always happen in the future but I wouldn't think if -- you had specifically talked about, maybe right after prototyping. No way, I don't believe that's happening at all just for all the reasons Moshe said, in terms of the change that's still going on in the overall environment and et cetera. So I don't think that's going to happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","First question is just getting back to the end markets and the guide. Jon, I think you mentioned that in the coming quarter, wireless will be down. But then I'm trying to reconcile that with TD-LTE builds happening. And since you did some prototyping, if they're happening in the back half and assuming they're strong, then what is weaker in wireless? So that's my first question. The second question is back to your business model through the cycle -- through the cycle, through all the top line volatility, the franchise has become more profitable. So could you please remind us again, and I won't ever fault you for not returning enough to shareholders, but the business is more profitable and you churn out a boatload of cash. So just remind us on the priorities on buyback versus dividend.","Jon A. Olson","Ambrish, wow, you've covered a whole lot of stuff in that question. From an end market perspective, yes, I can sense why there's may be some dissidence or differences in those 2 statements that I made that you mentioned. But a lot of what's going on is just what our customer patterns of individual projects. So nowhere near the entirety of our wireless business is dedicated to TD-LTE. In fact, it's obviously very small at this point in time. And again, prototypes tend to be built in batches, and then there's a deployment and then there's contracts-led and then there's approval for it. So it's natural to have kind of a buildup in one quarter, a pause and then a kind of an initialization of ramp when you're talking about a new technology rolled out. So that's some of what you're seeing in the June forecast. And then very broadly, the rest of our business, which is related to both 3G and LTE rollouts elsewhere in the world, it's just the normal bumpiness. I mean, we're not going way down or way up. It's just down a little bit in wireless and then up on the wired section. So it's not really particularly very pronounced for either one of those 2 subsegments in the direction that we've forecasted. So hopefully that was helpful. From a business model approach, yes, we are very profitable. I will remind you that we did return $430 million of our $660 million of operating cash this year to shareholders, so a very high percentage of what we generated this year. And we are confident about growing profitability in the company, and we will make adjustments to our return -- our cash return to shareholders as those opportunities present themselves relative to growing cash balances and decisions that we make about how to do that. So just to refresh your memory on what our strategy is, the first preference is dividend, and we've raised our dividend every year since inception, and we raised it again here in the last quarter by a double-digit percentage. And the buyback is at least dilution or in the range of $150 million -- $100 million to $150 million every year plus opportunistic on top of that, which is really dependent on the stock price and the cycles that are going on. And so we have an algorithm that we use as a guideline, but not as an absolute, and we implement that as it hits our stock prices.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just returning to the carrier CapEx commentary again. If you set China aside for a second and look at the broader market outside of China, if you total up what all the carriers have said about their spending plans for the year and look at what they spent so far, you mathematically conclude that there is going to be a big recovery in the back half of the year. So my question is, based on your customer forecast, do they basically support that snap back in the back half of the year or are you more cautious on whether that can really happen?","Jon A. Olson","Jim, when we put together our forecast for the year this year, and we try to add this thinking into what we talked about in the Investor Day in March is I agree with you. It looks a heck a lot more bullish if you add up all the capital spending that's been published, and we've indicated a very strong snap back in the second half, and we haven't actually -- we haven't modeled anything near that strong. I view it -- I think it's going to be more of a steady growth situation, not some sort of a step function up for a couple of quarters. So I think we've been a lot more cautious.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then as a follow-up, you have noted a really large increase sequentially in Europe. I think Europe was up 14% sequentially, and obviously, that's way outside the bounds of what the broader market in something like analog is doing. So can you help us understand what's going on with the European sales? Is that all being driven up by step-up in your large European telecom customer? And what do you expect from that region going forward?","Jon A. Olson","Actually, the growth in Europe was very broad-based, and the industrial improvement that we had forecasted in Europe came through. We had double-digit growth, I would say, in the mid to small customer range, just as we had forecasted. And it's nothing -- if anything, by the way, it was a little weaker than we thought in North America in that category, but in Europe, everything came out just right. So we had, in addition to this broader base industrial growth, which came through distribution support primarily, we also had strength in automotive this quarter that was focused a lot on that European market. So very strong business there. We had a few isolated aerospace and defense increases in Europe, greater than on a growth basis as well. Moshe talked about having multiple sub end markets growing. I mean, it really, this \"recovery\" that we had forecasted really was broad-based and it kind of got us back, I'd say, to the normal supply-demand kind of thing. I haven't been able to reconcile what other semiconductor companies have said in this, because I know there's been a lot of negativity going even into the March quarter around strength in industrial. We absolutely saw strength & industrial and in test & measurement and in broadcast and in automotive. And it wasn't just a large communications customer in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.","Delos Elder","This is Delos on behalf of Glen. I wanted to ask really quickly, if you can disclose it. How much of your cash balance is offshore and how much of your cash flow would you say is offshore as well?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, I'm always hesitant to give you -- to give precise numbers on the offshore\/onshore cash split because we do have ways of bringing cash back to the U.S. cash efficiently -- cash tax efficiently. Obviously, not all of it, some of it would get a 35% haircut. So I always bristle when someone or an investor says, \"I'm just taking your estimate of your offshore cash and giving you a 35% haircut.\" That really isn't right -- the right way to look at it. In the neighborhood of 1\/3 or so is onshore and 2\/3 is offshore. But again, I'm cautioning you some of the offshore can be brought back cash efficiently. From a cash generation perspective, I think we've told you, definitely have talked about this before. We're comfortable with our U.S. cash generation, able to absorb dividend -- our dividend payment plus increases in the future and dividend along with supporting all our U.S. needs for cash. So we're in a pretty good position in cash generation in the U.S. and also pretty good position in terms of our overall cash balances.","Delos Elder","And then regarding OpEx, it seems to be coming in a bit lower than expected. Are you being conservative there? Or -- and when does spending for 20-nanometer kick in?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so I think we're pretty much on our thought process in terms of our June forecast for OpEx. And it does grow throughout the year, so the second half of the year is greater because of tape-outs primarily. And there will be additional tape-outs for the next generation. I mean,","there's still some tape-outs going out but it's on a relatively low level of finishing off the 7 Series and Zynq parts. And in the second half, we will get some uptick in the second half, nowhere near the kind of uptick we experienced in the last fiscal year, where we had our huge crescendo. It's a little flatter starting, if you will. So second half up from first half.","Delos Elder","Great. And if I can just ask one more. 28-nanometer color, where is it doing well in the short run and where do you see it most successful in the long run?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, it's, by far, our broadest product offering. And if you look at the portfolio, it goes all the way from the low end, the Altix family, through Kintex, which is a wireless-oriented family, to Virtex and then there's the high-end of Virtex, which is primarily implemented with the 3D technology, where we're the only ones who are shipping that in production today. If you look at the breadth, it addresses all of the markets we're in. So there actually isn't a market that we play in which will not be served very well by 28-nanometer. If you look at timeframe, these markets tend to happen at a different rate. So wireless, the high end of test & measurement actually happened to occur quickly. Emulation, of course, happens quickly, too. So those are the 3 faster ones. And then the other markets tend to happen at their own distinct rates, where typically some elements of the aerospace and defense take the longest, but not all of them because even though they are markets that move faster than the average. But I would say it's a continuum, where the 3 that I mentioned are the fastest coming out. But based on the fact we've shipped to 500 customers in all of the markets we serve, it's coming out very broadly and strongly across the entire portfolio. And we expect it to manifest itself in being by far the strongest node we ever have had. And the early signs and the $100 million worth of revenue that was shipped this past fiscal year and the $250 million, which we feel confident in, are all manifestations of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, Moshe, I had a question on your Zynq product line. Clearly, there's a trend of ASSP replacement and Zynq is benefiting from that. Can you walk us through how you expect that to play out over the next couple of years? And do you think Zynq could be a 10% revenue generator for you guys?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, we -- it's a groundbreaking product and it addresses a lot of markets, which, again, happens at different rates. But for sure, it will be 10% or higher of the 28-nanometer generation. And because at any point in time, we're shipping numerous generations of product in parallel, it isn't likely to become 10% of our overall revenue anytime soon. But then there's the follow-on product of Zynq which will build upon that. So for 28-nanometer, for sure, it should be in excess of 10% above that. The way these markets work and the target markets to Zynq, some of them, for example, automotive and industrial, take a little longer to manifest themselves. So that will -- won't happen in the short term, but 3 to 4 years out, I would expect it to be well in excess of 10% of the overall revenue of the 28-nanometer shipments.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So is it fair to say that initial deployments are on high end, and as you get out new iterations, you're going to work your way towards the mid and low end?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","I wouldn't use high end and mid and low end here. I would say that it's market dependent. But Zynq is a mid and low end product by definition. It's not an ultra-high end product. It's basically focused on Kintex and Altix type sort of markets. But I would say within those, it's at the high end of those markets. That's what we've targeted Zynq at. And it's -- the design wins are phenomenal, and this year, it will start to be visible. The year we're in, the fiscal year we're in, it will be visible on the shipments. It just won't be at the 10% level yet by the end of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Moore - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you give us a similar discussion of the 3D business today? Can you help us now that you're over $40 million a quarter, can you help us decide how big that exposure might be and how big it might get?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well okay, let Jon -- I'll let Jon answer the first part and then I'll talk about where I think it could go.","Jon A. Olson","Yes. So I mean, the 3D, which implementation generally describes our largest devices, and the largest devices go into a combination of end markets relative to test & measurement and emulation and prototyping, and then also high end communications for high-speed -- for lots of [indiscernible] and then also aerospace & defense and other in communications, where you can take out much larger ASICs. So those are all descriptions of businesses that many of them don't take off like right away. But yet the emulation and prototyping do take off relatively fast. And vis-\u00e0-vis the strength of our $40 million are definitely was a significant contribution there. But by and large, as Moshe talked about how strong wireless and other end markets have been, our midrange product has taken off much, much faster from the revenue perspective. So it is extremely important to us, that technology, and it has been a very strong contributor to the $100 million level, but it's actually not the biggest component of what we've been shipping up to now.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Kintex by far has been the biggest component, and there's been huge take-up of Kintex shipments in the wireless market, so that's the biggest. And then the high end of Virtex is the second, and then it's the normal Virtex product followed by Altix and Zynq are still a very small percentage point. Over time, we'd expect Virtex and Kintex to probably be neck and neck, the mainstream Virtex and the main stream Kintex to be neck and neck in terms of being the largest and then the high end Virtex to follow that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with JPMorgan.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","With the 20-nanometer business being a little bit better than expected, can you just talk about your expected ramp for that in the June quarter and then the second half of the calendar year? And then, did you guys mention what that 40-nanometer\/45-nanometer revenue did during the quarter? If you could talk about that as well.","Jon A. Olson","Sure, Chris. The 28-nanometer ramp number next quarter, we said it would exceed $40 million again. So we exceeded $40 million in the March quarter. And in June, we said we would exceed $40 million again. And then just to remind you, Moshe said we would exceed $250 million for the year, which is consistent with what we said in New York at Investor Day. So that would lead a person to believe that there will be a quite a healthy ramp through September, December and March in order to achieve this greater than $250 million. So we do expect September to be approaching 10% of our revenue and continue to grow from that. We have -- again, these are predicated on lots of forecasts from customers but we have a very, I'd say, very detailed tracking around and monitoring of -- say, monetizing 28-nanometer at this company may be different than we've approached things in the past. And so we have a pretty good handle on what we think designs are ramping from our customers with respect to that technology. So we feel, I think, every bit as confident as we did in New York on this particular area. We didn't specifically say anything about the 6 Series. If you do the arithmetic on new products, quarter-on-quarter, new products is really made up of 28-nanometer and the 40-nanometer node. You would see that the 6 Series was in the neighborhood of flat quarter-on-quarter. So we do expect the 6 Series to grow next quarter, in the June quarter, and it starts to get flattened out per quarter and then it will start growing.","Christopher B. Danely - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And as my follow-up, I guess just one more question on capital allocation. So if I look at your share count from what's basically fiscal '07, '08 until fiscal '11, it went down at a pretty healthy rate. However, now that fiscal '13 is in the books, your share count's actually gone up a little bit each of the last couple of years, so along with your cash balance, too. So I was just wondering like how you guys look at that? What are the plans to deal with sort of the share count creep going forward here?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, the biggest dropper of our share count increase is the dilution effects of the convertible that the accounting world says we have to take but the call option we have to protect us on the strike price can't get recognized in the P&L, so on terms of the diluted share count. So it's actually a little bit of tyranny of accounting. If you net all that out, you would've seen a slightly declining share count for us. But because our actual stock price has been increasing, which is a good thing, over that same time period. You got to give some credit for stock price going up during that time. Now that doesn't necessarily wipe away your base question. I'm just trying to make sure that you understood what the mechanics were relative to the share count. So absolutely, we see our cash balances creeping up slightly, not to a great degree, and we have had kind of over 2 years of flat return of cash to shareholders in the neighborhood of 425 to 450 or 420 to 450 kind of a range and so we're quite aware of that. I'll also point out that we distributed in the neighborhood of 2\/3 of our operating cash for the year, which is actually a very high payout ratio. So we do look at a combination of payout ratios and our cash forecast in order to make that determination. And we're very aware of it and we have continuous conversations with the board about it and, again, we are continuing to review those particular alternatives. I'm not going to give a statement today that we're going to change what we're doing right now.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of William Stein with SunTrust.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","From your comments earlier in the call, it sounds like the booking pattern during the quarter improved, do I have that right? And then I have a follow-up.","Jon A. Olson","I think it kind of came out normal, kind of, I'll say, a normal quarter. We had a strong beginning and an okay third month of the quarter. And the second month is always a little lighter, vis-a-vis the first month of the quarter. So I wouldn't say it was exceptionally strong at the end. I think it was kind of average.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then to a degree there's normal with regard to seasonality anymore, can you remind us what you'd view as kind of a typical September quarter change sequentially?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, September is -- has been -- has a lot of -- has had a lot of different patterns for us in the past. We always have this effect of the industrial and smaller customers, particularly in Europe, getting a lot softer for us in September, in the September quarter. So June has been up. And I don't know if you look at history and seasonal, we're in the range of where we've been. And September sometimes has been down. But I'm not making any statement about September. Again, with all the CapEx spending growth that we believe is going to happen, it's way too early to know the timing of some of those programs to know about September.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Wu with Indaba Global Research.","Unknown Analyst","I've got one on Zynq because that's a new business for you and you're replacing existing processes. How should we think about the profitability of that business versus the FPGA business?","Jon A. Olson","At this point in time, what we've seen is it's pretty -- right now, it's pretty close to what -- from an end market by end market basis, to what the average is for each of our end markets. Now acknowledging that the first wave of business came from existing FPGA customers who are now substituting an FPGA and a processor for a Zynq product. So it's, I'll say there's some cannibalization going on relative to our FPGA business, but it is value-additive, because now we're getting the dollars for the processor as well. And so by and large, we aren't sensing any sort of downward pressure or difference. We have some designs where the value proposition is so high, we've been able to get a premium for it and in some situations where it's a more price sensitive.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Yes. And just to complete the thought there, the processor business is huge, and it goes all the way from the dirt-cheap microcontrollers to the ultra high-end, which obviously has very handsome margin. But we've targeted the middle of the market and so we have very intentionally stayed away from the profitless prosperity of the ultra low end, and we're making sure that the product, in of itself, targets markets where we believe that it's generally in line with our FPGA business. We're not targeting, at this point, neither do I expect to see in the future to target those ultra low end, dirt-cheap markets where we can sell billions of these but it's unlikely to enable us to sustain our model. So if you look at the way the product is designed, if you look at the power of processor there, which is actually a very formidable dual processor core, you can see why we're pretty confident in our ability to do that. And that's why we're not saying this is a couture product, it isn't. It's targeted for markets which are more in line with our typical markets.","Unknown Analyst","I see. Can I ask a quick follow-on. Do you treat that, the process CPU market, as a separate line item in your own internal business? Or do you see that as an ASP enrichment? So really it's, P&L-wise, it's still folded into your FPGA business.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Well, we look at it both ways that when you introduce a new product, which really is revolutionary and we were the first to do this way ahead of anyone with regards to product of this sort, and we now have been followed happily into this. But quite fundamentally, at this point, when you have a new product, you want to isolate it so you can accelerate your learning and it is looked at separately at this point. I do believe that over time, these markets do tend to converge. And  if you look at other technologies we've introduced in the past, where they were totally separate or they address a small niche of our applications, over time, those technologies have become widely used. And so DSP cores are now widely used, SerDes are widely used. So over time, I do expect it to converge and become closer to our core markets.","Unknown Analyst","Just one quick follow-up. Is there a need for you to expand into the 64-bit addressing that the ARM camp have just recently announced and does it help you in your customer base?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","More technology is always better, right? So I won't say it doesn't help us. But if you look at the product we have, it really has very broad applicability. And there is an emerging 64-bit market. And as this progresses, I wouldn't be surprised if, over time, we look at ways to address that. But this isn't a short-term need for our core market. Our core markets are more than adequately serviced by the existing architecture and its capabilities.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ian Ing with Lazard Capital Markets.","Tyler Radke - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","This is actually Tyler Radke on behalf of Ian Ing. My first question, as it relates to TSMC's 16-nanometer pull in. I'm just trying to understand how that changes your strategy with respect to 20-nanometers, and can you just kind of walk us through the puts and takes of that.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. Why don't I answer that and if you could kindly raise your voice when you ask the second question, because you're very barely audible to us so we can hardly make it out. But we are very pleased with our success with 28-nanometer. We were first in the market. We have the broadest portfolio by far, we have the deepest portfolio by far, and we've demonstrated that even with a totally new foundry, we can come out and demonstrate leadership. Similarly on 20-nanometer, we've already announced some elements with regards to tape-out, where we believe we're going to be the first FPGA company to tape-out a 20-nanometer software. The software is there already. It's being used broadly by customers and a whole host of other things, which gives me tremendous confidence that in 20-nanometer we're going to be able to continue and extend that leadership and keep our generation ahead. And we have not announced anything yet on our plans beyond that, but rest assured that we are not resting on our laurels here, and we expect to continue to deliver leadership to our customers, and we will communicate that and our strategy when it behooves us. At this point in time, most of the design wins or a large plurality is in 28-nanometers. We'll continue to be there in that for some years going forward and then immediately after that, there's the 20 and we will make sure that we have a response for anything beyond that at the appropriate time.","Tyler Radke - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. So my second question, my follow-up, I don't want to beat the dead horse here but just as it relates to wired and carrier CapEx, obviously, I think you guys said wired was down more than expected but you expected it to be up next quarter. And as you look at obviously, AT&T and Verizon CapEx coming in a bit lighter than they'd hoped, do you think this is a function of late releases of their budgets and this stuff getting pushed out into June or is there something else, your customers are saying that we should be thinking about?","Jon A. Olson","Our specific method is and then our confidence about the next quarter was directly related to only a couple of customers' programs, that the timing was off from what we had thought. So I want to make another statement in a second, but I was going to make sure that it was clear not to read too much into my next statement, because there really is a macroeconomic overhang where people -- where the confidence in spending kind of ebbs and flows almost on a weekly or monthly basis. And that does end up with caution in our customers' ordering patterns and they always say they want to expedite and do something. And we are finding it harder and harder to nail down forecasts and trends on key programs just because of that secondary factor. But again, the fact that we were down, lower than expectations, and we're going -- when are we going to come back up some in wired is really related to a couple of specific programs at a couple of specific customers.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","And with regards to LTE deployment, one way of looking at it, and probably the best way is, as a customer, regardless of who's winning and who's not winning on the smartphone world, that world just continues to go through the roof. It generates huge demands on the infrastructure. Those infrastructural demands can only be addressed by, over time, moving to the newest generation technology. And to a large extent, we're seeing a commitment, a strategic commitment to do that and it's in each country, region. It happens at a different rate, but it definitely is happening. And to some extent, when you have a major -- in all of these companies, they have numerous carriers. At any point in time when one pulls ahead, it generates tremendous demand for the others to catch up. Otherwise, their service levels become unacceptable. And we're seeing that happen. So even if from time to time, they do need to watch their deployments, we see more of those dollars being directed at new technologies as opposed to upgrading old ones. So given our very strong 28-nanometer position and the larger percentage that we get, that tends to help us. So I am very bullish on that and I don't see that trend reversing itself anytime soon.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with CLSA.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This is Ryan Goodman for Srini. Just as a follow-on to that last question on wired, so it sounds like the macro is weighing a bit on maybe the enterprise demand -- enterprise demand within wired. Could you give an update on how the data center demand looks? And also last quarter, I think you had mentioned a large data center high-speed connectivity win that was supposed to ramp in the second half. Any update on that as well?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so I think you characterized the wired accurately there. And relative to data center, our data center market is a new area for us, and it will take a little bit of time before it grows at a more accelerated rate. But when it does, some of the design wins we won already and are about to win is going to start to take off at a more accelerated rate, but that's going to be in the back half of the year and into next year. We have won the design -- any of the designs that we've talked about in Investor Day in New York, we're still either on track to win or have won because things are going very well, yes, and it is around high-speed connectivity as our biggest value add there. Now we have been in solid-state drives fairly broadly as controller units. That business continues to be very good for us across a variety of customers. But it ebbs and flows on individual customers' shipments, et cetera. But by and large, we're where we wanted to be on data center, but it's not the big part of our communications business at this point in time.","Ryan Goodman - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just for another area, in industrial, looked pretty strong across the board. Just curious, how much of that do you think is coming from inventory replenishment versus sell-through demand? And how do feel about customer inventory levels now? Are you comfortable where they are going forward?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, I think given the fact that we're maybe a little bit of an outlier of calling the industrial recovery and we had it, I think quite a bit of maybe in the neighborhood of 2\/3 was inventory replenishment. So we are seeing strong -- signs of stronger continued ordering patterns from some key customers there, which do lead me to believe there is sell-through going on in that particular end market category. I do not believe there is much inventory in the channel in that end market at all at this point. No build up.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Xilinx Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rick Muscha. Thank you. Mr. Muscha, you may begin your conference.","Rick Muscha","Thank you, and good afternoon. With me are Moshe Gavrielov, CEO; and Jon Olson, CFO. We'll provide a financial and business review of the March quarter, and then we'll open the call for questions.","Let me remind everyone that during our conference call today, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions based on information that is currently available, and that actual results may differ materially.","We refer you to the documents the company files with the SEC, including our 10-Ks, 10-Qs and 8-Ks. These documents contain and identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.  This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It can be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website. Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon A. Olson","Thank you, Rick. Fiscal year 2012 was marked by challenging industry conditions. In spite of these, Xilinx introduced a record number of 28-nanometer products, gained market share on the 40-nanometer node and reported record operating cash flow of $827 million. Additionally, cost reduction efforts of the company contributed to gross margin improvement in each consecutive quarter of the year, enabling Xilinx to report a record gross margin of 66.4% in the March quarter.","Turning to the March quarter, Xilinx sales were $559 million, up 9% sequentially and down 5% from the same quarter a year ago. This was better than our guidance heading into the quarter, primarily due to better-than-expected business from wireless communications customers deploying LTE and 3D technology, as well as a strong rebound across-the-board in the Industrial and Other category. Consumer & Automotive also posted better-than-expected strength due to exceptionally strong Automotive business across a broad base of customers and a better-than-expected growth from audio and video broadcast.","Gross margin was a record of 66.4%, up from 65.8% in the prior quarter, driven in part by a more favorable customer and product mix, but also cost reduction efforts driven by the company, including better-than-expected yield improvement on newer products and better inventory supply chain management.","Operating expenses were $208 million, only $1 million dollars higher than guided, as we were able to offset higher variable with expense management efforts. Operating margin was 29.1%, up from 26.8% in the prior quarter.","New product sales were up 11% sequentially. Sales increases from our 28-, 40-, 45-nanometer and 65-nanometer products, all contributed to this increase. Mainstream products declined 4% and base products increased 21% sequentially or $24 million. The increase associated with last time buy products was about $18 million or approximately 3% of total revenue in Q4.","Let me now turn to a discussion of end markets. Communication sales increased 5% sequentially, driven by wireless sales, which increased double-digits during the quarter while wired sales were essentially flat. The Industrial and Other category posted the strongest sequential sales growth during the quarter, increasing 18% sequentially, with all secondary markets increasing double-digits. Consumer & Automotive sales increased 9% sequentially driven by strength from audio\/video broadcast and automotive, while pure-play consumer applications were flat. Lastly, data processing sales decreased as anticipated, driven by weaker storage sales.","Net income for the quarter was $134 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Other income and expense was a net expense of $7.1 million, better than guided due primarily to higher-than-anticipated gains associated with our investment portfolio and a non-U.S. investment credit. Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $208 million before $20 million in CapEx. We paid $50 million in cash dividend during the quarter, and recently raised our quarterly dividend $0.03 per share to 22% -- $0.22 per share per quarter.","The tax rate in the March quarter was 14%. Diluted shares for the quarter were 276 million. There was a 7.7 million share dilutive effect from our convertible notes due to an increase in the average stock price during the quarter. For questions related to the dilution associated with our convertibles, please visit our Investor Relations website at www.investor.xilinx.com.","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments increased $175 million to approximately $3.1 billion. We have approximately $1.3 billion in convertible debt and our net cash position is approximately $1.8 billion. Days sales outstanding decreased 3 days in the March quarter to 35 days. Inventory dollars at Xilinx declined by $41 million sequentially during the quarter. Combined inventory days at Xilinx, distribution were 110, down significantly as expected from 142 days in the prior quarter. In the June quarter, we expect both dollars and days of inventory to slightly decline as we continue to align the appropriate supply with demand trend.","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the June quarter of fiscal year '13. Our backlog heading into the quarter is up sequentially. We are expecting strong growth from our 28-nanometer and 40-, 45-nanometer product families. From an end market perspective, we are expecting sales from Communications to be up sequentially, with increases in both wired and wireless. We expect sales from Industrial and Other to be approximately flat sequentially, as increases in industrial, scientific and medical are offset by a decrease from defense. Consumer & Automotive is expected to be approximately flat, as increases in automotive are offset by a decrease in audio\/video broadcast. Lastly, we expect data processing sales to increase sequentially. We expect last time buy sales to decline by about $5 million sequentially.","As a result, we are expecting total sales to be up 1% to up 5% sequentially, with sales from Asia Pacific expected to increase, sales from Europe expected to be approximately flat and sales from the U.S. and Japan expected to be down. And the midpoint of our sales guidance is predicated on a turns rate of approximately 55%.","Gross margin is expected to be between 65% and 66%, slightly lower than the March quarter due to strong growth expectations from our 40-, 45-nanometer and 28-nanometer products. Operating expenses in the June quarter are expected to be approximately $220 million, including approximately $2 million of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. The majority of the growth in spending compared with the March quarter is in R&D and related to the 28-nanometer ramp, as our tape-out activity remains high.","There's also some growth in our SG&A related primarily to variable spending increases as a result of higher revenue and also higher legal expenses. Other income and expense is expected to be a net expense of approximately $8 million. The share count is expected to be approximately 277 million shares. The tax rate is expected to be approximately 16%. This number excludes the impact of the R&D tax credit which has expired. Our estimate of the impact if reinstated in its current form, would lower the tax rate by approximately 1.5%.","Let me now let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon, and good afternoon to you all. Sales increased over 9% sequentially in the March quarter, driven by double-digit increases from 6 of our secondary end market segments. This broad-based strength gives me confidence to us seeing a recovery in our business. Sales from new products, including our 28-nanometer and 40-, 45-nanometer families, drove growth during the quarter. With regard specifically to the 40-, 45-nanometer product family, revenue grew approximately 70% in fiscal year '12 over the previous year. This significant growth has allowed us to greatly improve our market share position in this node. Although this product generation will likely be much smaller over its lifetime than the 28-nanometer node, our share gains clearly indicate strong customer acceptance for these products. With regards to 28-nanometer, our sales during the quarter was driven by Kintex-7, the industry's first 28-nanometer FPGA family; and Virtex-7, including our stacked silicon interconnect technology, the industry's first 3D IC product with 2 million logic sales. 28-nanometer product family rollout continues at a rapid pace and will, without question, be the most successful node in the company's history. ","In the March quarter, we achieved 2 significant milestones. First, we announced the transition to the production phase of the Kintex K325T FPGA. This has accelerated our ability to serve the demand created by the outstanding acceptance of 7 Series FPGA product family. We also began shipping Virtex-7 690T FPGA from our high-performance Virtex family. This device establishes a new benchmark for single-chip, serial bandwidth and is very well suited to address the market requirements of high-performance wired communications applications that require lower power, single-chip solutions.","The 28-nanometer design win momentum continues to be outstanding. Now totaling more than 650, the total value of over $2 billion. Approximately 1\/2 of the designs we have in the Communications end market are actually replacing ASIC or ASSP business, providing further testament to the acceleration of the programmable imperative. We've grown PLD market share for the past 5 quarters. The improvement in shares is a testimonial to the work over the past few years to deliver the most innovative, differentiated and highest value product portfolio. In addition, yesterday, we announced the delivery of the final, broad and very significant element of our indisputable technology leadership strategy.","The Vivado Design Suite allows us to break away from the competition in productivity and enables the highest leverage of our next-generation product portfolio. Vivado is an IP and system-centric design environment built from the ground up to the next decade of what Xilinx calls, All-Programmable Devices. These devices go beyond programmable logic and I\/O to enable programmable systems integration, leveraging various components of 3D stacked silicon interconnect technology, ARM-based embedded systems, Analog Mixed Signal, advanced high-speed serial transceivers, and a growing percentage of IP cores.  The Vivado Design Suite is estimated to provide customers with up to a 4x productivity advantage over last generation development environments. Truly a revolutionary achievement. I cannot overstate how essential this is to enabling broad access for our customers to our leading-edge technology and for enabling accelerated revenue growth of 28-nanometer node. ","In summary, I believe our all-in investment strategy is paying off. We have shipped parts from 4 of the 5 28-nanometer product families to more than 120 customers, demonstrating its broad acceptance. We're expecting 28-nanometer sales to exceed $10 million in the June quarter. We'll continue to execute the aggressive rollout plan.","With continuously increasing market share, execution on the indisputable market-leading 28-nanometer portfolio, now and another breakout move in design productivity with Vivado, fiscal year '13 promises to be an incredibly exciting year for us. Let me now turn the call back to the operator to open it up for the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura System.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","It's Romit Shah from Nomura. The results look pretty solid. I had a question on industrial. Is it fair to characterize the strength in this segment as largely driven by market share?","Jon A. Olson","Well, I wouldn't necessarily attribute it entirely to market share or even primarily to market share. I think what's happening out in the market, there is both a replenishment of inventory cycle that's going on but also sell-throughs. So we wouldn't have seen the -- I would say the overall strength in broad-based industrial or its scientific and medical applications, as well test and measurement, if there really wasn't a good pull-through going all the way. And while I do believe we are getting a lot of traction in the 40-, 45-nanometer area, and it's still very early on the 28-nanometer, we do think that was part of what contributed to share. But I don't want to say it's -- that's the only reason.","Romit J. Shah - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Then what changes in Q2 -- because I noticed that you're guiding that segment flat.","Jon A. Olson","Well, the biggest issue there is because of defense. So we had a defense program or 2 that was kicking in, in this past quarter in the March quarter. And so that caused our defense business to be higher. And so what's happening in the June quarter is that's coming back down. So in other words, the lumpy kind of a project acquisition from a defense perspective project, and the remainder of the industrial segment will continue -- continues to grow. So that's the balance that's going on, one piece going down, the other 2 pieces going up, but it ends up approximately flat.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from the Bank of Montreal.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Moshe, I'm sure, this is topmost in everybody's mind. There is variance between yourself and Altera, but this time, it's very big. I'm just trying to understand your -- just give us your perspective please, if I look at revenues, look at inventory and we do understand that you guys have a better kind of more diverse foundry relationship that allows you to step aside or at least mitigate some of the impact that we're hearing other companies talk about. And then my follow-through for you, Jon. On the margin front, are we ready to break out of the band that you guys have laid out for us? Because it sounds like STSM becomes a bigger mix and then as yields improve in 40, 45, shouldn't we be headed North of the stated trajectory?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Okay. So we can't really comment on what other people are seeing. We're seeing strong demand from the customers. We feel we have an incredibly strong portfolio, which after 4.5 years of building up is starting to demonstrate its strength. And this is now very, very broad. And the significant impacts of that are yet to come because this is mostly in 28-nanometer, and that's why we're projecting the $10 million for this upcoming quarter and we've, I think done a good job in meeting the customers' requirements. We believe that the technology choices we have made have high yields, enable the customers to get lower power and generally, higher performance across the board, and that should manifest itself. So from my perspective, the best is yet to come.","Jon A. Olson","I just want to add a little bit to that before I get to your margin question. If you look at what we've said going into this quarter and certainly, the way it ended up and when we're talking about next quarter, I mean, the recovery is well underway. I mean, it wasn't underway this past quarter. And we had 6 of our 10 sub-markets grew double digits, 7 of our 10 grow in absolute percentage. So that's not just a one-trick-pony kind of an adjustment situation for us. So we definitely feel, and Moshe pointed out in his remarks, that the recoveries underway and work through the first quarter and go again in the second quarter of it. So we do feel business overall, spending overall by companies is continuing to grow. I'm always a conservative guy. There's not snapback going on but there certainly -- it's -- we feel a lot more steady demand from our customers. So we're feeling pretty good. And from an inventory perspective, we do have some variety in our foundry partners. But on the other hand, we seem to be getting what we need to have even though in some places, it is tight, we were getting what we need to have from our foundry partners in order to meet customer demand. So I'm -- another example of what that means is our lead times are essentially up to normal standard. There's no extension going on, on any lead times anywhere. So we have ample inventory in order to serve our customers and we're getting support from foundries at that level. ","From a margin perspective, yes, I anticipate this question being asked about 3 times today. Well, geez, why not improve your model? Well, the -- it's a difficult thing to forecast because mix is always a component of that. We had slightly lower top 50 customer contribution than the previous couple of quarters, 5 percentage point or 2. So there's a customer mix that tends to drive our -- to drive it a little bit better. We are very pleased with where we are with the yields right now, and I did say in the Analyst Day that once we got through the, I'll say, massive tape-out and introduction phase, if this route is -- this trajectory really holds is that we should flow that up to the top of the range or above. We just kind of got there really fast. And even though next quarter is -- we're still modifying that to say it's going to be near the top end of the range, 65% to 66%, we are very positive that we can operate at the high-end of that range given the dynamics, the way they are. So basically, I'm not ready to raise it. We'll see how things go.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider with Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you'd comment on the kind of progress and the recovery in the communications vertical, specifically. You talked about wireless and wireline, both seeing strong improvement. Can you discuss any kind of differential in the wireless coming back faster than wireline or the reverse? And then maybe any kind of color by geography will be helpful.","Jon A. Olson","Sure. Let me take that one. So in the March quarter, it's driven primarily by wireless. So -- and if you also saw there, our European geographic segment was up. So -- and we talked -- and I talked in my remarks about LTE and 3G. So we feel like the activity going on in a worldwide basis x the Chinese manufacturers are actually going pretty well. And while I'm not necessarily saying that all the LTE providers in the U.S. are in a massive capital spend, they are -- we do believe that capital spend is going up and I think we've heard T-Mobile come out and say they're going to be doing some things in LTE. And so we are seeing a -- I'll say a nice support there relative to advanced technologies. And we happen to be tied strongly to one of the manufacturers of base stations that seems to be doing really well even on a worldwide basis. So that works out pretty well for us. So we definitely, in March, saw more of the strength in wireless than wired. Now if you take -- go back and look at December to March, our wired went up and we were concerned that we wouldn't be able to hold that. And we actually did hold that in this quarter. So it was flat. And now we're seeing both are going up, and what we're really seeing there is continued strength in the -- again, in the general LTE and 3G worldwide situation in addition to the fact, that we do see a network spend in terms of the network side of our wired business improving in the quarter. And it's actually fairly broad-based across several customers of the major guys. It isn't just one person popping up. So we are starting to see some spending going on, and we feel pretty good about where our position is in serving that capital spend that's going on.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And then maybe could you comment a little bit on the strength you're seeing in Europe outside of your largest wireless customer? Is that all the increased you saw of 27% in the quarter or was there strength beyond that as well?","Jon A. Olson","No, there was really quite a bit of strength that of -- in the industrial category. In fact, between industrial and Communications, it was a very big pop for us there. So it was much broader than that. I know there's a lot being said about the economy in Europe not being all that well, but we're actually seeing customers really engaged with rolling out with new products, their products. So all that has been really, really positive to us and we're obviously hopeful that, that continues. And no, it was not just a wireless play in Europe.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Uche Orji with UBS.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Let me just ask you a bit on the wired part of the business. So, Jon, you said you expect that to grow next quarter. Any comments you can make as to what you're seeing between service providers and enterprise? And I asked that because some of the comments coming out of the enterprise companies during this earnings season has been kind of mixed in terms how things are playing out now. So any comments you can make there would be helpful.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, I think on the wired side going forward, it is -- there are several customers that I think have been pretty lean on inventory and is starting to build that inventory, and that's helping us even though I'm aware that their specific announcements haven't been all that great. But our design wins have been increasing there over the last few years in, I'll say, nontraditional FPGA areas and some of those designs are starting to kick in, particularly and we noted our 40-, 45-nanometer product family growing. We talked about that in the Analyst Day about how we thought that was going to be an increasing market share as we add designs taking off. And that in fact, is part of what's driving that for us in the wired, not solely, but part of what's going on there. And it is a more positive enterprise view than we had in the past quarter. So we are counting on the enterprise side of that being a leader in that growth in June.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. That's great. And just to finish up on -- do you have any 10% customers you want to mention to us? And I have a question for Moshe, for the quarter.","Jon A. Olson","We have no 10% customers for the quarter or the year.","Uche X. Orji - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Moshe, let me just ask you about the issues on 28-nanometer that TSMC has talked about. Obviously, you're not a high-volume customer yet of 28. But what is your take as to what that does in Europe for your ability to ramp in volume? Is that something that concerns you at this stage or not?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So Dr. Morris Chang gave a presentation at the TSMC technical conference and talked about challenges they have and, to a large extent, said that the worst was behind them. We were there first, picked out first, got product first, moved into production first, and we have the benefit of HPL, which has less process steps and probably is a tad less challenging. So it may be that, that is what is helping us through this. We don't have any HP or LP, and so far, so good. And you are right in pointing out that the numbers are very low at this point. But they're going to ramp up significantly in this quarter and the quarter we're in and the quarters going forward. So we watched this with -- very closely and we believe that our relationship is helping but more than anything else, it's the choice of the HPL process and being there first may have given us some benefits, which others may not have seen. Other than that, it's all conjecture on my part.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citi.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess maybe an extension to that question, which is to the extent there is any lack of availability of 28-nanometer wafers, not making a statement here about yield, is it possible that the 40-nanometer node may, in fact, play out a little bit longer? And might that not, at this stage, of 40-nanometer be a benefit for value because you guys are coming off your worst point of 40-nanometer share and are showing some signs of share gain there?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","No -- well, as you know, in 40-nanometer, we have relationship with UMC has worked generally well for us at that note in terms of technology availability. In terms of 28, it just provides such huge benefits in terms of much low power, increased performance, increased functionality and we have a much broader portfolio at 28 than we had at 40 and 45 node. So even though -- if you're asking for us to stack things, we don't see these issues at 40 at all. We do have the unique position there. So maybe that is helping us. And the 28 so far, we have not seen any challenges. It is, as Jon pointed out, very, very tight. And again, possible selection of HPL in addition to the product benefits maybe helped in terms of maturity yield, et cetera. But we really don't know. So we're a little puzzled as to those issues ourselves.","Jon A. Olson","Yes. I mean, I think that there's a lot been talked about relative to that from a couple of other companies and we have -- quite frankly, I've been scratching our head a little bit about the scenario that has been talked about. But nonetheless, and one of your premises there was that 40, might last longer because of this. I don't view any of the conversation with 28-nanometer suggesting it's including long-term capacity constraints or whatever. I'm certainly not thinking that, and we are very strongly supportive of growing our 28-nanometer as fast as possible. It's just -- again what we've been talking about has been our strength. So I think Moshe characterized it right. I mean, we've got some differences of what process we're using. It has different characteristics to it and maybe that has something to do with it. And we were very early with lots of tape-outs, and so I think we have a very broad portfolio that's been sampled and that may have helped us put some level of a number of wafers through the system, et cetera. I don't know because we've been at this with a lot of different parts for quite a few quarters now.","Glen Yeung - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can I just ask as a follow-up, if I look at the quarter-on-quarter progression, I think someone else said that there have been gaps between yourself and your primary competitor. Obviously, this quarter's gap noticeable and I think if you normalized their results for some changes at the end of the quarter, you're gaining share this quarter and next. Is there any -- can you help us figure out where that share gain is coming from, from an end market perspective and also maybe from a geographic perspective if you can do that?","Jon A. Olson","Well, I think wireless is clearly one of those distinctions because the China market has not really been strong from a TD perspective. And that might be where we're weaker on a market share basis in the wideband CDMA portion of 3G and then LTE, where we have tremendous strength. So I think you're seeing a technology -- a manufacturer and technology gains going on that favor us quite a bit. And I think that's -- in the wireless space, I think that is what's -- the biggest differential is who we're partnering with the closest and what geographies that those customers are serving and where the strengths are right now on the wireless capital spend space. So we feel that, that's part of our driver. I don't -- I cannot explain the industrial side. We've seen extremely strong growth there. As I said very broadly, our customers are doing well. We've got parts for them. So I don't -- I don't know why we would have a different characteristics than our competitor. But we do, apparently. And geographically on the industrial side, all geographies grew for us there. So we had -- again, worldwide strength, not just one geography or one subsegment in one geography, et cetera. So the recoveries here and next quarter is the second -- the second quarter of it and we're moving along.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla with William Blair.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Digging a little bit deeper into the wireless 4G solutions that you talked about, are you gaining access in new content on these 4G LTE base stations or is it basically more of the same functions?","Jon A. Olson","Oh, no, we've been progressively increasing content so 3G to LTE is kind of a 2x factor for us in terms of penetration. So when we're off selling parts that end up in the LTE space, we end up selling a lot of parts. So to the extent that the CapEx, worldwide CapEx, spending in wireless is favoring the most advanced technology that favors PLDs, frankly. So that's helped us a lot.","Moshe N. Gavrielov","We've got the trend now for 3 generations. So with each generation of product, the amount of FPGAs used or the percentage of the system, which is implemented in the FPGA has grown significantly consistently and we see that continuing for a whole host of reasons.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. So Moshe, if I look at the architecture, are you going closer to the edge of the network? Or the content increase is more in the core perhaps?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","It's primarily in the core and there's a huge deficit in terms of wireless infrastructure which is getting aggravated by this huge growth on the smartphone market, where the demands are just unbelievable. And this is well documented. There's a huge issue there. And it requires these upgrade to this new standard because the usage model is now totally different. So we see that continuing, and when we talk to our key customers in each of these areas, they don't see it slowing down. If anything, they see it accelerating  generation-on-generation right now. Obviously, there are pricing pressures, et cetera, but it -- in terms of a need, that umbrella need is growing for what we call insatiable, intelligent bandwidths. And the intelligent in the wireless side comes from the smartphones.","Anil K. Doradla - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And one of the biggest concerns that's been voiced about you guys was about the single architecture in 28-nanometers. You already got traction. Seems like you're getting good traction. How would you debunk or -- how are customers embracing your 28-nanometers and whether that issue which was brought up with single architecture versus designing for the low mid-high, I mean is that -- do you think it's...","Moshe N. Gavrielov","Yes, so we obviously did a terrible job in explaining what we're doing. So we -- it's true we have a single manufacturing process. That's absolutely true, which is HPL. We think that, that was at the core of the success because it's actually a high-performance, yet low-power process. So it actually enables us to span the product families. Now what we have is a scalable, optimized architecture with -- at the high-end, it's optimized for performance. In the midrange, it's -- which is Kintex, it absolutely has an unbelievably well-matched performance power footprint, which we believe is a huge differentiator vis-\u00e0-vis what the competition has, which use LP process there and typically, does not have enough performance. At the low end, the -- it was optimized for a lowest power and the lowest cost, and the fact -- they are fixing that. I can tell you that if there's one decision that not only would I never change but I -- if I could have done it on the 40- and 45-nanometer node, this is the decision. Right? And so if it -- if we have failed to explain the benefits of it, shame on us. But the customers are thrilled with it, and if you look at the product definition and what the customers can achieve, at the high-end, it's higher performance and higher capacity than the competition and higher bandwidth. In the midrange, it absolutely hits that performance power cost trade-off, which is not easy to achieve. But we think we've hit it and we think that the competition missed in a big way there. And at the low end, we've already rolled out the Zynq offering, which shows the Artix fabric, and the results are great, it's functional and part of our fast rollout and being first to market with the breadth of product is due to having the same manufacturing process but having highly differentiated [Audio Gap] ","so if we failed to explain that they are optimized for the 3 points, we did a great injustice. But they are optimized, and if you go to the customers, just ask them what they see. We have the highest performance, we have the best trade-off in the middle, and we also have a low-cost, low-power version, which we think is second to none. So we're delighted with where we are. And again, I would never -- not change this and you can guess that to the extent that these options are available in the future, we're very likely to go the same way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I apologize for the technical difficulty earlier. Just a couple of questions. Jon, if I've got -- remember my  numbers correctly from the Analyst Day earlier in the year, you guys kind of talked about growth rates by segments and I think you mentioned industrial is kind of being a 6% longer-term grower. And I guess my question is given that industrial is now is effectively flat with the kind of the peak you saw back in June '11, that is holding up a lot better than the rest of the business, do we have to rethink kind of the longer-term growth opportunity in that market? And if it is a better grower, what are the margin implications? And then I have a follow-up for Moshe.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so John, yes. What we have to be a little careful about in having one new data point from the Analyst Day and then try to extrapolate it. So I agree with you that industrial is -- has been stronger. But remember, some of this growth has been inventory replenishment.","So that's got some part to do that -- to do with that. And I think our statement around the industrial growth rates during that time frame was one of the areas we were confident that we're going to grow quite a bit on, is with our Zynq product it's just going to take a while for that to kick in and have more significant growth. And the industrial category just take a longer time period. So I'm very bullish on the industrial over the long haul, it's just that we modified the industrial category a little bit, and I think it was mostly because of where we thought the defense spending was going more than anything else, and not the broad-based industrial and scientific and medical area.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And, Jon, to the extent that, that does grow faster, do you think that margin accretive or is too difficult to tell given the mix?","Jon A. Olson","It's generally margin accretive but to the extent we might be putting -- pitting Zynq against ASSPs, it's not clear yet to us.","John Pitzer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then -- Moshe, just quickly, on 28-nanometer, just given the absolute dollar amount, it's kind of meaningless to talk about end market breakdown today. But if you think about design activity and which end markets are doing the most activity there, if you think about a 4-quarter aggregate number, how do we think about 28 by end market?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So the fastest out of the shoot is wireless, and that's why we chose to focus on Kintex because truthfully, we did not have the best solution in the previous generation, and we let the competition win more than we did at wireless in the previous generation of products. Now we expect to reverse that with a vengeance. And there's a lot of designs in there out the chute, really fast and that Kintex is the perfect solution for the wireless market. Then what we're seeing and we -- is now wired comms, in the -- all of the high-end, the prototyping market just benefiting from the higher capacity and higher throughput that there is on our Virtex 7 product as opposed to the competing product. And it is true that we started a little later there, but now that, that's moving ahead for us, we expect to not only catch-up but actually have a very significant lead in terms of market share over time on that. We just have higher capacity, have higher serial throughput. We actually have significantly lower power on the high-end, and that's where HPL is a major benefit. And so that should be the second out the chute and Zynq is obviously, starting that tends to be more markets like automotive and industrial that move little more slowly but the design wins are accumulating at a huge rate there, and we're very pleased with that. And then Artix will follow. Artix is -- there's elements which are targeted at some higher volume consumer-type applications, but it also has a whole host of other markets which will be addressed there. So that's sort of how we see the sequence and, to some extent, where the $10 million which were well underway to delivering this quarter is a function of all of those.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Looking at your base product revenue of 21% in the quarter, that's the type of increase that's typically unsustainable. How much of this is just the result of inventory replenishment because of the shipping in previous quarters and then how should we look at this going forward?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, Tristan, so it was up 21% or $24 million in terms of the quantification because I just want to make sure that the percentage increase doesn't overweigh the fact that the increase was $24 million on our base of $559 million. And of that 24% increase, there was an increase in our last time buy category or products, which are reflected in the base, so about $18 million. So the remaining increase was related to defense programs, spending primarily as some of the legacy programs continue to take parts over time. So that, that is an up-and-down thing depending on when those programs decide to take part. So we don't believe the base is sustainable at an increasing -- in fact, they'll be fewer last time buy parts being sold next quarter and then in the September quarter, the last time buy program will be essentially over in that point. So I think base returns back to its normal decline by the September quarter.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And was there any unusual pricing in the quarter relative to some of your turns business?","Jon A. Olson","I'm not sure what's behind that question, but no, I mean, we don't have any spot pricing kinds of things that happen in those situations. If you look at our ASP trends, they were pretty normal and as expected. So I don't think there was anything there. I'm not really sure what you're asking, but I hope I answered it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Barclays.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was hoping to ask a market share question. If I look at your share versus Altera back at the trough in Q4 '10, and the guide for Q2, it was roughly about 500 bps uplift or around $50 million per quarter in terms of gains. And so curious on that, what percentage do you think is sustainable versus what do you think is more lumpy like defense or and\/or end-of-life benefit?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So there's quite a few elements, and that's a difficult question to answer. But end-of-life is something which is not a onetime event. It's part of the normal modus operandi in the semiconductor business. It tends to be challenging on the FPGA side because our product have very long product life cycles and the customers are in slow-moving markets. So we have a strategy which has a minimum of 12 years, and these end-of-lifes are actually at that point or are well beyond that. But it's something which is a sustainable part of the business. It's not a onetime event. It's not like taking a big ASIC deal at lower margin. It's sort of something which is really repeatable for us and we just sort of do that. And we have it mapped out and on our website, we actually have projections as to when to expect it going forward. So don't want you to sort of assume that there's some sleight-of-hand here. This is repeatable business going forward, and it's the way -- no, it's just due to the mismatch between fabs not having infinite lifetime at a given process node and our customers' requirement. And -- so that's the one element. The second element really, it's sort of difficult to look back and understand and to some extent, we're looking forward. And the reason for our bullishness is the strength of the 28-nanometer product portfolio. So there's 2 things we said. We believe that we're going to, over time, grow our market share at the 40-, 45-nanometer node, going forward to 50%. And obviously this quarter is a big leap from the mid-30s into the mid-40s, something like that. And the reason that we're positive on that is we have a broader product offering, which is now catching on. We definitely were later, and we paid the price for that. And -- but you're now catching up and a lot of that is the spot-and-fixed product, which basically -- we're there and to the best of our knowledge, there's no one with a significant FPGA low-end portfolio at the 45-nanometer. And that helps a whole host of markets, and that will help us over time grow between Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 that we continue to be -- to expect that to grow to 50%, as those products are now moving into production. Having said all of that, the real exciting thing is the 28-nanometer, the quality of the product offering, its position. And that -- if you look at the markets that have the biggest benefit there, as I mentioned before, short-term, it's wireless. But then, wired at the high-end and actually eating into the ASIC and ASSP market is starting to happen in spades. That's why we made the comment that on the communication space, as we look at our design wins, about 50% of them are actually in competition with ASIC, and in some cases, ASSP products. And the reason that we're seeing that is those are becoming hideously expensive either for companies to design as ASICs or for ASSP companies to continue their roadmaps. So there is this inevitable exit in terms of wired communications. And if you look back as recently as 10 years ago, there are probably more than 90 companies in that space that has dropped to around 20 companies in that space. And even they're struggling except for the very big one, to provide forward-looking roadmaps. And that's, that's what the 28-nanometer enables us to address. So you asked a very large question, and I don't want to spend everyone's time here. But I would say that those are the major effects.","Christopher J. Muse - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Very helpful. I really appreciate it, Moshe. And, Jon, as a quick follow-up, cash -- net cash has grown out to A+ dollars. Curious how you think about dividends, stock buyback and what kind of cash level you really need to run the business.","Jon A. Olson","Yes, so clearly, I think you see pretty broadly across many of the technology companies that cash has been growing and with the market being relatively hot there's probably some more reticence to do share repurchases than not. We've got our model that we do share purchases on in terms of strike prices and other ways of looking at it. We didn't repurchase any shares this last quarter but we're obviously, committed to purchase -- repurchase shares and we will adjust our model over time to do that. So I think you can count on us being in the market and repurchasing shares from time to time. And we are still very committed to growing the dividend on an annual basis on which we increased 16% growth in our dividend that we just announced for this current quarter. So it is -- it is definitely an issue, I know all in your minds and we're -- we continue to look at it.","Operator","Our next question comes our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with BofA Merrill Lynch.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have a question on the long-term R&D intensity for Xilinx. I think you had the 2 successive years of very high spending outpacing sales growth. And it's not just for Xilinx. I think it's for all the lenders. The cost and complexity is growing and I think the 20-nanometer transition, even though it's a few years again it's probably going to be more expensive. How do you look at the R&D trajectory from there? How do you manage it? How do you get more leverage in the model?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","So the way we look at it is we have a target and obviously, we're slightly above the target. In reality, that being slightly above is not due to overspending. There was expectation of revenue growth and since the market was a little soft, we tend to hit the high -- the top end numbers. But as we looked at it, we said okay, what do we do now? And we feel that the right thing to do is to exploit the very significant substantial edge we have on 28-nanometer because it's going to be a huge node for us. We have leadership in numerous aspects, now we have leadership on the software side too, which has the broadest applicability and that has the highest lever on growth, right? So we are big believers in that. Having said that, we're not taking that out of control. So we've given absolute numbers that we fully intend to respect and to live within those limitations. From generation to generation, we're actually becoming a lot more efficient and effective. What is happening is that the tape-out costs and the mass costs are going up significantly. And so when those happen en masse, as were they are happening now, as we're driving the products out so we can benefit from our portfolio, it generates a bit of an artificial bulge on our R&D costs. But the expectation is that, that will go down somewhat. If you look at our projected investment over the 2 years, it is where we said it would be. It's -- it was a little lower last fiscal year and it'll be a little higher this fiscal year than we had expected. But overall, the total number is actually less than we had urgently projected. And as we're working full steam on the 20-nanometer, we're just being a whole lot more effective and the design -- the products are being defined and hopefully designed in a way which should enable us to resume at that at that level. And it requires a lot more ingenuity and fiscal control and we're committed to doing that. So the question is valid one, and the answer is a lot of hard work in order to keep doing that. We don't intend to blow through with the numbers even though each product is more difficult and the mass cost for sure is significantly higher.","Vivek Arya - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And perhaps more just something related and revisiting this issue of 28-nanometer availability. Obviously, this year is not as big for you guys from a revenue perspective on 28-nanometer. But as demand grows for 28-nanometer, are you looking at alternative supply sources just from a risk management perspective?","Moshe N. Gavrielov","If you were at the -- TSMC forum, they made it very clear that the worst is behind us at this point in time and they're continuing to invest and to bring up their capacity at 28 nanometers. So there -- our expectation is that, that will get resolved and actually, to a large extent, has been resolved from our perspective at this point. So now we have -- we're thrilled with our relationship with TSMC, and we continue to believe that, that was a great decision at 28.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Shawn Webster with Macquarie.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Yes, I was wondering if you could help us with our -- I had a couple of questions. One was mix and then another was on the last time buy. On the mix, could you share just what the dollar value of your 28-nanometer product was? And I was also curious what your mix in the March quarter was of defense and wireless comm?","Jon A. Olson","So no, we're not -- we haven't -- did not or not providing our 28-nanometer number. Revenue in the quarter more than doubled from the previous quarter and it's on track towards our -- hitting $10 million milestone that we have been talking about for a couple of quarters, which will happen in the June quarter. So the defense business did grow quarter-to-quarter. And traditionally, it's been in the neighborhood of 15% of our total revenue and it's still in that about that same level, maybe a tad more. And I'm sorry I missed the other mix question.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","The wireless infrastructure as a percent of sales?","Jon A. Olson","Yes, wireless has been bouncing around a lot in -- the last time we gave a number, it was 25% but then there was a big cycle that went on, so it went down below 20% and it's moving its way back towards 25%, but still far away -- it's still, pretty -- got to ways to go there.","Shawn R. Webster - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then on the last time program buys, it sounds like this was a -- or you stated it was a normal part of your business but is there something unusual about what's happening with the $18 million that you're calling it out and is it the case that the remainder of it will completely fall off by September? Or is it something that will kind of inch down over the course of the year?","Jon A. Olson","No, we called it out because it is a significant -- it was a contribution where to the revenue growth, where -- there was a concentration, and I'll say, an abnormal increase in that category of products and base. And we thought it was important to call it out. And it will go down some in the June quarter and then totally fall off from that class of products. It's a very old, old products that we have in September. And so we've been running mid-single-digit percentage of that class of product, and it will -- like I said, it will decrease a little bit in September, and then -- excuse me, in June, it will drop off totally in September.","Rick Muscha","Thanks for joining us today.

This conference call is open to all and is being webcast live. It could be accessed from our Xilinx Investor Relations website.","Let me now turn the call over to Jon Olson.","Jon Olson","Thank you, Rick. The quarter was characterized by strong profitability, although revenue was slightly below our guidance. Xilinx sales were $613 million, down 1% sequentially. The two primary end markets contributing to the shortfall versus our expectation were China LTE and aerospace and defense. ","Total wireless revenue was significantly down -- excuse me -- was slightly down primarily due to a lower than anticipated 28-nanometer sales to China LTE base station manufacturers. ","Sales from these customers were below our expectations due to some balancing of component inventory. LTE deployment outside of China remained healthy, and as a result we had better than expected shipment of our 40-nanometer and 65-nanometer technology. ","Aerospace and defense was weaker primarily due to the timing of certain key programs moving into the September quarter. We are confident that this segment will see a very significant rebound in the September quarter. ","Wired communications sales were up and better than anticipated driven by enterprise networking OTN and access business. The Industrial, Scientific and Medical segment rebounded nicely as expected. New products increased 6% sequentially driven by both Virtex 6, Spartan 6 growth. Turns were 47% for the quarter.","Gross margin was 69.1% for the quarter, higher than forecasted due primarily to product mix. We also continue to make good progress in cost improvement across our new product families, particularly in yield and backend expenses. ","Operating expenses were $217 million including amortization of $2.4 million, slightly below lower than forecasted due to variable expenses related to lower revenue and lower stock-based compensation expense. ","Other income and expense was a net expense of $6 million better than forecasted mainly due to the higher -- to higher interest income on our investment portfolio. Net income for the quarter was $173.6 million or $0.62 per diluted share. ","Operating cash flow for the March quarter was $130 million before $9 million in CapEx during the quarter. Operating cash flow was impacted by higher working capital requirement due to the timing of receivables and payables along with higher inventory level. ","Diluted shares for the quarter were 282 million shares. This was 4 million less than the forecasted due to the impact of a lower stock price and increased buyback activity during the quarter. There was a 9 million share dilutive effect from the convertible note.","We continue to be committed to returning cash to shareholders and during the quarter we stepped up our buyback activity repurchasing 2.1 million shares for $100 million. We also paid a record $77 million in quarterly dividend. ","Let me now comment on the balance sheet. Cash and investments decreased $53 million to approximately $3.6 billion. We have $600 million in convertible debt and $1 billion in fixed rate debt resulting in a net cash position of approximately $2.0 billion.","Combined inventory days at Xilinx and distribution increased as we forecasted. The total inventory days are 135, up from 115 days in the prior quarter. As you recall earlier this year, we have got safety stock particularly in 28-nanometer to ensure sufficient supply to meet our demand outlook. We expect inventories to remains at these elevated levels through December and then begin to decline. ","Let me now turn to a discussion of guidance for the September quarter fiscal year 2015. Our backlog heading into the quarter is slightly down sequentially. We expect wired and wireless communications to be down in the September quarter. ","The leading factors driving the decrease in wireless sales are a delay in our expectations for the next phase of China LTE deployment and absorption of inventory at key customers. We currently anticipate wireless sales to increase meaningfully into December and March quarters. After posting its highest sales level in nearly two years, wired communication is expected to decline sequentially in the September quarter.","We expect industrial and aerospace and defense segment to be up significantly driven by aerospace and defense. Broadcast, Consumer and Others expected to be flat sequentially. As a result, we are expecting total sales for the September quarter to be flat to down 4%. The midpoint of this guidance is predicated on a turns ratio of approximately 48%. ","Gross margin is expected to be approximately 70% as we benefit from customer mix during the quarter. Operating expenses in the September quarter are expected to be approximately $236 million including $2.5 million of amortization of acquisition related intangibles. The majority of this increase is related to R&D mask and tape-out expense for 20-nanomenter technology. ","Other income and expense for the September quarter is expected to be a net expense of approximately $7 million and share count is expected to be approximately flat. The tax rate for the September quarter is expected to be approximately 13%.","Now let me comment on changes for fiscal year 2015 expectation. We remain confident in our broad base of 28-nanometer growth opportunities and believe this family will demonstrate strong growth in fiscal year 2015. However, the ramp will be slower than previously anticipated. The key drivers for this change are the pace of China LTE deployment and a slower than expected ramp in wired communications. ","As a result, we expect our total revenue to be up approximately 5% for the fiscal year. This forecast is predicated on increased China wireless sales in the December and March quarters as key customer inventories are absorbed in the next phase of LTE deployment begin. ","Gross margin will be mix dependent in the December and March quarters, but we remain comfortable with our fiscal year 2015 gross margin guidance of 68% to 70%. Operating expenses will be lower than anticipated as we manage the business appropriately to focus on superior next-generation product development and execution within a disciplined financial framework. ","R&D expense for the year is expected to be approximately $530 million and SG&A expense approximately $380 million. Other income and expense will be a net expense of approximately $28 million, down from the prior guidance of $34 million due to better returns from our investment portfolio. And the tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%.","Let me now turn the call over to Moshe.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you, Jon and good afternoon to you all. While we are disappointed with top line during this June quarter, our continued focus on profitability drove significant increases in both gross and operating margin to 69.1% and 33.7% respectively, resulting in earnings per share of $0.62.","Following the March quarter we had 28-nanometer sales increased 40% to more than $140 million. 28-nanometer sales exceeded $130 million in the June quarter. This slight pullback was forced by a temporary pause in China LTE activity.","Despite this pause, we remain very confident that the 28-nanometer nodes will continue to be the most successful node in our history, served as the growth driver for the company for several years.","We are still in the early phases of 28-nanometer revenue growth, the very large number of design wins being converted to revenue over the next several years across a very broad range of markets.","Consequently, we expect 28-nanometer growth to resume in the second half of our fiscal year with meaningful contributions from new LTE orders and more rapid growth from a host of ramps and design wins in markets including wired communication and data center and industrial. ","Given our current disability of these ramps, we are revising our fiscal year 2015 28-nanometer sales target to be approximately $600 million. A proven formula for successful execution established the 28-nanometer continues to yield excellent results to 20-nanometer, the UltraScale family.","Kintex UltraScale, the industry\u2019s first 20-nanometer device been in the market since November -- per our largest customer is providing us with more than six months advantage over competitive product.","During the quarter, we began shipping our Virtex UltraScale All Programmable FPGA, industry's only high-end product offering in 20-nanometer. This family provides our customers with unprecedented level -- system-level performance and integration, that enables the displacement of another class of ASICs and ASSPs.","Let me now turn the call back to the operator for Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura. Your line is open. Romit Shah, your line is open.","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. I appreciate it. On the China LTE, how do you think about how much it is the supply issue versus the demand issue? In other words, is this just a another pause in a broader built out or is the -- the demand continues to be okay, maybe they preordered some of the components ahead of what is really continue to build. Could you give us any color on that, that would be great? Thanks.","Jon Olson","Yeah. Jim, I think this past quarter, our fiscal Q1 quarter was little more on the inventory side as, I think you recall, we had a huge shipment to them in the March quarter and some of the -- the situation with supply chain overall with other suppliers certainly has challenged some of the OEMs in China. ","So, I think I would characterize our fiscal Q1 as being a little more on the supply side and the fiscal Q2 more -- a little more being on the delay side of when phase III is going to hit, although there is still little bit of inventory rebalancing going on in that. ","So, it's probably the -- I don\u2019t know if I can really handicap a percentage, but each of those quarters but that\u2019s how I would describe it. ","James Covello - Goldman Sachs","And I guess for my follow-up, I'd stand on that same topic, are we seeing any of the kind of incomplete kitting dynamic that we've seen in prior cycles?","In other words, I don\u2019t think PLDs are the longest lead-time or the things where the lead-times have stretched the most. But we know things like RF have stretched quite a better.","Are we seeing customers order the entire kit waiting for the longest lead-time item or is that really not part of the supply dynamic in this cycle?","Jon Olson","Well, I do think that they were trying to make -- generally trying to get their supply chain solidified and they have placed orders on us to make sure that we have supply and in some cases they took that.","They took those parts though, if they wouldn\u2019t get -- if they were short of some of other parts that they kept, then I would say, yes, they are -- in some cases have been ordering partial kits, if you will, to make sure that they could try to build when they got the full building materials.","James Covello - Goldman Sachs","Very helpful. Thank you so much. Good luck.","Moshe Gavrielov","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","Hi, thank you. Jon in the past you have talked about your sense of how many base stations have been built. So where are we in the build from China Mobile? And I think you've also talked about your expectation for what the other carriers you will be building out?","Jon Olson","Yeah, so our best information is they are in -- have been through this June period in the neighborhood of 300,000 base stations built from the China Mobile perspective.","And I think some of the differences in our thought process is when they were going to beyond the 400-500 into the next phase and that seems to have pushed out into calendar 2015 now. And so think they are in the process of getting to their 400-500 between now and the end of the calendar year.","And then with respect to FD, the FD phase is still not well understood in terms of when that will begin. We're still counting on that to have some impact for us in our December quarter as builds will happen ahead of deployment, obviously.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","So then what gives you the confidence than that you would see a rebound in the second half of the fiscal year in the wireless business?","Jon Olson","Yeah, I think it's really talking to -- individually to each of the customers and the carriers. We've had multiple visits over the last three weeks and that -- of both the manufacturers and the carriers and this is our best sense of what's going on. ","I mean, as inventory is depleted the kits are fully deployed as the shortages dry up than we would expect a rebound from that and then also an impact for Phase III which is the next way from China Mobile. So those two effects together should provide us a second half increase.","Ambrish Srivastava - BMO","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your line is open.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays","Thanks very much for taking the question. This is Chris Hemmelgarn on for Blayne. Just first of all, could you talk a little bit about where you think your share is for 28 and I guess kind of what your -- obviously, it's down a little bit in the June quarter. But do you expect that to continue to decline in the September or do you expect a rebound in the 28-nanometer revenue?","Moshe Gavrielov","If you look at the past fiscal year which ended in March, our share grew significantly over the year and actually for the whole year it was over 70%. And our prediction for this quarter is over $130 million and that should put us in the high-60s in terms of percentage. But, you know that depends, of course, on what the competition does there.","But, no, we are confident in the exceeding $130 million and remaining well ahead. And we expect it to continue to restart its accelerated growth in the December quarter. So this quarter and the next quarter 28-nanometer revenue will be relatively flattish and then we expect it to grow in the December quarter and the March quarter and to yield overall $600 million, which is the new target for the year. And, no, you couldn\u2019t do the arithmetic on what the market share will be then based on whatever you predict as the companies will ship 28-nanometers.","Jon Olson","Yeah, Chris. If I can add another little color to that, if you think about what's happened here in this flat spot on 28-nanometer, it's really been driven very largely by Kintex the mid-range because of China Wireless where we have very, very strong market share, which we still -- I believe we'll be maintaining throughout this particular cycle. And if you look inside some of the other product families, as well, test and measurement was down some, and so that impacted the very high end of Virtex. But the other, broad based Virtex parts grew quite nicely throughout the quarter, which is one of the reasons our wired business is up, as well.","So, we\u2019re getting really good traction across the Board in our product families in 28-nanometer. And what you're really seeing is the effect of China on the Kintex family, which takes so many parts into the radios and base bands.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays","That's really helpful. Thanks so much. Then just as a quick follow-up. Obviously a strong gross margin quarter and continuing in September. Can you just talk about your expectations for the trend throughout the fiscal year? Can you continue at these high levels, or does that pull back a bit?","Jon Olson","Yes, as I said, 68% to 70% is still our full year forecast. And I think when we talked about this a quarter ago, we did talk about the potential of having it hit 70% at some point, depending on what mix is going on there.","We\u2019re forecasting to be at the top end of the range in our fiscal Q2 and it will be mix-dependent. So, for example, if wireless ticks up, it will have some downward pressure. So, it really depends on the mix of other customers or other end markets, whether it's sustained, but, again, our forecast is to be in the 68% to 70% range.","Chris Hemmelgarn - Barclays","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon. How much room do you have to further cut operating expense if the rebound that you expect from TD-LTE starting in the December quarter does not materialize?","Jon Olson","Yes, so we've taken a position, as I said in the remarks, to be at the low end of our previous range. We're certainly looking broadly across the company for, I would say, typical kind of belt-tightening opportunities to help balance out some of the top line change and therefore, overall profitability changes in our full year outlook.","However, we remain committed to developing -- to continue the 20-nanometer and 16-nanometer development programs. We will not be slowing those down and cutting those back.","So, we have some other things that are under consideration and we're looking at as alternatives if we need to do something. But we aren't going to change our fundamental approach of developing and getting new technology out as fast as possible.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Okay. And then if I look at the mix by node from China between you and your competitor, do you expect that mix to change as orders rebound starting in the December quarter, more toward 28-nanometer? Or do you think that the mix of ordering patterns from Huawei between 65, 40, and 28 will remain the same as in the next investment wave for TD-LTE?","Jon Olson","Yes, we believe that there will be a bias towards conversion of certain sockets that are in older technologies at 28-nanometer in certain manufacturers in China, which is to our benefit. So, I think that premise is still what we believe and the same premise that we've had all along. We do believe that as the year moves forward, we'll continue to gain a little more share there.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair. Your line is open.","Anil Doradla - William Blair","Hey guys, couple questions. Why was the inventory build-up by now -- I mean we get these things in waves and cycles. Was there anything unique about the inventory build-up this time with the Chinese customer? Or was it pretty much in line with what you've seen in the past? And then I have a follow-up.","Jon Olson","Well, I think the unique part, Anil, was a little more the shortage issue and I think, the supply chain dynamic with the Chinese manufacturers to make sure they could secure enough supply from people. And we got caught in the -- we built a lot; they took a lot. And some of the other suppliers didn't build up to the request and so we're getting the effect of that.","Is this different than the past? I don't know how to compare it to any point in time in the future -- or excuse me, in the past, relative to that. It is what it is right now. I don't know that I can compare it to the 3G wave in any way.","Anil Doradla - William Blair","And stepping back, looking at the big picture, to a skeptic, one might say that the last time we had this 3G wave was -- Beijing Olympics was supposed to be big on 3G. Well, it took almost four years before we saw it.","To a skeptic who questions the premise that the trajectory on China 4G is perhaps right here and now, or over the next six to 12 months -- it's not that, but it's more like over the next two years. How would you react to that?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, the expectation is that it will be a three-year deployment. That is in line with previous generations. This is a massive deployment; it's a huge country and it's being deployed in several waves.","The previous wave had about six cycles to it, and we wouldn't be surprised if this one has a similar multiple cycles. And the next one counts as number three, in the way we're think. And then the previous generation was one carrier, albeit the biggest one, this one has all three carriers. And the other two smaller ones are expected to start a little later and with a different -- the FD approach, largely.","And as a result, the expectation is that it will continue to be a multi-year rollout. And in terms of the peak, depending on exactly when these other two carriers go into their broader deployment, but we can't expect the peak to be in calendar 2015, but for the deployment to continue well beyond calendar 2015. And that would be very much in line with the previous facts, right, as opposed to the conjecture, which may have assumed that it happened faster.","Anil Doradla - William Blair","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding the China LTE inventory, I'm hoping you can give us some view as to where you see the inventory build. Has it been in component distribution, or at the contract manufacturers, at the OEMs themselves, or maybe even at the carrier, at China Mobile? Any visibility into that would be helpful.","Jon Olson","Yes, well, our best understanding of this is at the OEM manufacturer, whether they're doing it themselves or they're using a contract manufacturer. And the portion where they're waiting for other components, that's where that sits.","Relative to how many base stations are sitting in OEMs' warehouses; I really don't have a good view of that. I think that is not as big of an issue after we work through the early part of the summer than it was before that beforehand.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Great. And then if I can ask one follow-up about the gross margin improvement in the quarter. If you were a completely vertically integrated manufacturer, I'd be highlighting the inventory build as probably a driver here, but I'm not sure it's the case with your company. Maybe you can help me understand whether the inventory build sequentially helped gross margin in the quarter.","Jon Olson","Yes, the inventory build did not help gross margin, in our case, since we do purchase wafers and have them assembled and tested. The inventory was really representing the cost of the work in process of the wafers we purchased.","So, we don't have any spending that gets built up in inventory as a result of factory expenses, if you will, because we're on our purchase price variance issue -- or variance process with the wafer purchases. So, that was not the driver.","The driver on a quarter-to-quarter basis was cost reductions with lower yield. So, we were essentially purchasing units, if you will, or the cost of the unit was lower on a quarter-on-quarter basis.","So that's why there was a quarter-to-quarter improvement. And then versus our expectations for the quarter, it was really more around mix. We sold less into the wireless business than we had anticipated and more into a few other end markets that pushed gross margin up a little.","William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Yeah, good afternoon, Moshe and Jon. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Guys, first, just a clarification, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in China for you guys, relative to other players. And I know these data points don't always line up exactly. But TI, Sanima (ph), Ericsson, ZTE all relatively positive commentary around the TD-LTE base station deployment in China. You guys talking more about a pause. Do you think that this is specific to you guys? Or do you think as the earnings season goes on, we'll hear more and more about the pause in China?","Jon Olson","Yes, I don't know what others are going to say, quite frankly. And I think what we're calling a pause is from -- there's two things going on here again, John. One is there was a lot of inventory -- Xilinx inventory, purchased by the OEMs that was built up. And there's not a total match in their supply chain for what they're doing. So, that's part of the story.","The second part of the story around a pause, it was a pause for us versus our expectations. I think, as Moshe characterized a little earlier, there was a view that there was going to be a very, very rapid deployment in China.","And this Phase III that we're talking about, we thought was going to happen a quarter or so sooner than it actually is happening. Whether we were misinformed or what other companies think about that, I really can't comment on that. I really don't know that. But I do know, versus our expectations, its coming -- this Phase III is coming later than we had anticipated.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Jon, that's helpful. And then, Moshe, maybe as my follow-up question, a little bit longer-term question. You guys talked about some operating expenses ramping because of 20-nanometer. I wonder if you can give us an update on FinFET.","There's clearly a lot of controversy out there on when TSMC might get there versus guys like Samsung, GLOBALFOUNDRIES. How comfortable are you still with your timeline around FinFET? And if you had to change course and go with a different foundry vendor, could you? How easily could that be done? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","We are delighted with the progress of TSMC. As best we can tell, we are on -- they're on schedule and they have numerous other users of the technology who actually, in this case, will even be ahead of us.","So, there really is no issue, in our mind, on the availability of the FinFET from TSMC. And, if anything, we've heard significant delays with other players, is that we're not seeing, that, and they are hitting all of their milestones; and so far, so good. So, there is no issue there with regards to their execution.","In 16, 28 and the 20; and, as best we can tell, at 16, and they're doing 16 in two cycles. They're doing a FinFET and they're doing the FinFET Plus version, and we're going to be using the FinFET Plus version. And -- so, we're benefiting from all of their development at this point in time.","John Pitzer - Credit Suisse","Thanks, Moshe. I appreciate it.","Moshe Gavrielov","Sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ian Ing from MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Yes, thanks for letting me ask question. So, for industrial, aerospace, and defense, it looks like its 18% below prior peak, so we're probably in the middle stages of a semiconductor recovery cycle. So, do you think you get back to peak run rates in the coming quarters if it's really just an aerospace and defense program timing issue? Or have some sockets maybe moved on to some other activities?","Jon Olson","Yes, I don't know that I can -- I haven't really studied exactly where the peak is at what level. But I think we're going to see a very significant increase because of these key programs that we know that are on the books to spend the money this quarter in aerospace and defense.","Last quarter there was a lot of trying to understand why we were an outlier on the pure industrial, scientific, and medical side. That rebounded very nicely. We do expect that to be strong again in the September quarter, with aerospace and defense on top of it growing very significantly. Not sure that we'll get to a peak. But it will certainly be back on -- in that neighborhood, if you will, in that general range, in the September quarter.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Great. And as a follow-on to an earlier question, how much of the 4G base station opportunities still haven't switched over to 28-nanometers? And does that largely switch over with Phase III and China Mobile?","Jon Olson","It's really -- it's very different by manufacturer. I think we've said in the past, we've won about 80% of the sockets. How long certain manufacturers -- the ones that are still using older technologies, hang onto older technologies, it's hard to -- from a China perspective -- is hard to handicap, quite frankly. I would say the lion's share of what's shipped in China is certainly 28-nanometer.","Ian Ing - MKM Partners","Okay, so it's a gradual process, still. Okay, thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for taking my question. Jon, Moshe, is it fair to assume that for growth in your December and March quarters, that you are depending on the FD-LTE deployment to take off? And if yes, how should we think about the number of base stations that could be deployed in those two quarters for FD-LTE?","Jon Olson","Yes, I think on the -- what we're counting on and the second half is clearly the Phase III build to start happening for China Mobile, which is still TD. And we're counting on, I would say, a modest beginning of the FD cycle.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I see.","Jon Olson","In terms of numbers of base stations on FD, I think we're talking about, over the cycle and the time period, to be approaching 0.5 million, but this is just going to be the beginning of that. And as Moshe talked about, later this continues on a more steady basis through 2015 and 2016.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, should we then think, Jon, that by the time you get to your December and March quarters that you should be running at the same sort of normalized levels in your communications business that you were in the March or June quarter of this year? Is it a recovery back to those levels? Or do you think it could be -- by the time we get to the back half of your year, we could still be looking at year-on-year growth.","Jon Olson","Well, March was such a crescendo, and June was down from that in China, so I don't know what normalized is, Vivek. I hesitate to make a statement and mislead you, because I'm not even sure what's normalized. The variability around the China business is continued.","We do expect both the December and March quarter to be larger -- excuse me, the December to March quarter to be larger than September. Will it be larger -- and probably larger than the June quarter as well, but I don't know how to answer the normalized part of it.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And one last question, if I may. Could you remind us again of the launch timing of your 16-nanometer and the 20-nanometer products? Thank you.","Moshe Gavrielov","So, the 20-nanometer, both families are now available. The initial tape out was of Kintex, that is moving into production and we're sampling the Virtex product line. We're -- and the feedback we have is that we have a minimum of a six month's lead based on any competitive product.","On the 16-nanometer -- this is FinFET, we're on schedule to tape out in Q1 of calendar year 2015. And what has happened is that we have revised our roadmap to better align with customer requirements and specifications.","So, originally, we had expected to tape out by the end of the year. We're now expecting to tape out our first 16-nanometer device in the first quarter of 2015.","Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from CLSA. Your line is open.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC","Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Ryan Goodman in for Srini. So, another question on China LTE. I understand that it sounds like the primary driver was a push-out in the second leg of the Phase III build and inventory digestion. I'm curious, though, if you saw any changes in the competitive dynamics over in China, just as your competitor is ramping up on their 28-nanometer solutions.","Jon Olson","Not really. I think there was probably some pressure around pricing from a perspective of holding onto older technologies and delaying the conversion to 28-nanometer, which would've been to our benefit.","And there's been a little bit more of that activity going on. But I wouldn\u2019t call it so severe that it really changes our expectations that much. But, nothing really on 28-nanometer competitive front that\u2019s different than our previous expectations.","Moshe Gavrielov","We continue to be supremely confident in our market share position on 28-nanometer, in particular on China LTE, nothing has changed in that regard, best we call tell.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Okay, great. And then for a follow-up, you talked about the inventory levels going on in China. Can you talk just about some of the other markets like Industrial or Wireline? Are you seeing normal inventory levels at the customers out there or is there any risk of a similar dynamic playing out in couple of quarters? Just any color you could add there?","Jon Olson","Yeah, individual customers has always a period of where they particularly -- they take inventory to do proto builds before they go get certified. Again, this is heavy -- I'm talking about wired communications equipment that requires all those certifications.","So there is always some lumpiness, if you will, in an individual customer. But we've seen a couple of really strong quarters out of wired, strong quarters out of our 28-nanometer product family, which again is a very positive sign for us in converting sockets that were previously ASICs and ASSPs to FPGAs. All those things are on track.","We really aren\u2019t seeing in other end markets any appreciable inventory build I would say on an industry wide basis. And again, individual customers can have their particular issues from time-to-time.","Ryan Goodman - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. I wonder if you look back over the last couple of quarters and you look at what preceded that inventory accumulation. Did you guys have any kind of lead-time extensions or is there anything -- I'm trying to -- is there anything you can identify that would have led to an accumulation other than just the customer being a little bit too optimistic?","Moshe Gavrielov","So, no, we've -- we anticipated the potential of having this not look like a 3G rollout, meaning it was going to go a lot faster and so we had built up safety stock which is why our inventory balances are higher than we would normally have them. So we have built up in advance and we communicated to the customers that we had adequate supply to meet their forecast.","And that -- in the end, they took whatever they thought they wanted to have and in some cases we believe they took more of our inventory than they actually ultimately needed.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Moshe Gavrielov","I don\u2019t see -- there were no signs and no -- nothing that, I think, we could have done any differently on the inventory front.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Okay, great. And then with regards to the industrial aerospace and defense that business has gyrated a lot. It was growing over 30% a few quarters ago and the slowed down. Now it looks like ex-defense really sort of start picking back up. Was there any kind of inventory dynamic around that movement -- that sort of excess that you saw in the mid part of last year, the slowdown and then snap back from that?","Jon Olson","Well, clearly, part of our explanation for the March quarter was -- and industrial, scientific and medical was related to some key customers that had inventory build-up that they were bleeding off. And then those customers bought inventory this past quarter, the June quarter. ","And so we did experience that and that was the reason that we were different, I think, than some of our peers. It was customer -- specific customer related more than anything else. At this point in time we aren\u2019t seeing any real build up in the ISM category. And a","Aerospace, defense is all program related really, so it's not the same kind of a business model.","Joe Moore - Morgan Stanley","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Romit Shah from Nomura. Your line is open","Romit Shah - Nomura","Yeah. Thanks a lot. Jon, it's my understanding that revenues have missed the midpoint of guidance two out of the last three quarters and it's been a little surprising given that we perceive you guys to be gaining share and beneficiary both LTE spending a better economy. ","So can you just talk a little bit about what's been the challenge in terms of forecasting on a quarter-over-quarter basis, because it doesn\u2019t seem like this was an issue last year?","Jon Olson","Yeah, Romit, it's very interesting observation. You've kind of put a mirror right up to us here on that one. And you are right, we have missed, and it's really -- quite frankly, it's been in two areas, and the two areas we talk about this time, China LTE and aerospace and defense. And we have certainly ridden a bit of this roller coaster on the China LTE business, pretty much everything else we have relative to our end markets and other plans that we have made for the year seem to be working out just fine, but those two end markets have been difficult for us. ","Aerospace and defense, while it does have a seasonal attribute to it where it\u2019s typically lower in this summer like it is now and then accelerates in September and December. It has been a little more pronounced. And as we came off the Defense Department budget changes and before that the sequestration issue, there has been a lot of churn going on with respect to military contractors and the quality of some of the forecasts that, you know, we have been less than to our expectations. ","And so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really any other broad base end market issue or customer issue, but we have struggled in getting to those forecast for China LTE and aerospace and defense in the last two or three quarters. And that pretty much explains why we've either missed or been at the low end of our range. ","Romit Shah - Nomura","And I guess, sitting here today, what's the confidence level that beyond fiscal 2015, you guys can get back to that 8% to 12% growth target? Or look at that target and say, yeah, that's the right way to think about our revenue growth.","Jon Olson","Yeah, from my perspective, it\u2019s to me -- this is -- these are the kind of things CFOs do think about a lot and try to figure out what's really going on and what's our trajectory level. And while, we can talk about design wins and how big the dollars are and all of those kinds of things, it\u2019s really around what are the big customer drivers, the big sockets that we have that should be delivering that kind of expansion to our SAM. And these are the sockets that are not traditionally FPGAs that we have won.","And so I have gone back and I have checked on all of those businesses particularly in the wired area. Other end markets like test and measurement are going gangbusters on 28-nanometer. That's not really the issue. The growth is that communications side really, in a lot of places wireless and wired. And in every case the conversion and the SAM expansion activities that we have claimed are still on track. It's just happening slower than anticipated.","So, that's what gives me confidence. I can't -- I don\u2019t know how to communicate that to the audience here in any different way, other than a tremendous amount of activity tracking what we think are the key differentiators that are going to result in SAM expansion for us. And we really aren\u2019t losing shares of 28-nanometer. If anything we are accelerating and winning more in the design win particularly in the SoC-based product and in wired communications side.","Romit Shah - Nomura","All right. Thank you. I appreciate your comments.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra from Baird. Your line is open. ","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Hi. Just a quick follow-up from the previous question. So, you mentioned that the ramp of TD-LTE in China had been more difficult to forecast that you had expected. You also mentioned during the Q&A that you over-shipped real end demand. So is it -- should we really assume that this is the end demand that's the problem? Or is there perhaps a discrepancy between the underlying infrastructure build and your revenue?","And, if so, is it fair to assume that there is potentially a mix issue? I mean, we know that your market share is up year-over-year, so could there be something else, notably in terms of average ASPs that could be disappointing relative to the real end demand? ","Jon Olson","Yes, I think I would trying -- at least, if I understand the question correctly, Tristan, I was trying to answer that earlier in the call around the inventory imbalance that drove probably more of our issues in the June quarter overall, meaning the inventory balance of other component suppliers into the OEM, and the September quarter was more about the pace and the digestion of base stations in terms of the rollout for us. ","So it is a combination of both. And again, I think, in the earlier part of the summer, it\u2019s really more around the component balancing at our customers' inventory.","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Yes. I think what I meant is that you over-shipped and yet the past few quarters were disappointing. So is the end demand that much slower that what you initially predicted? Or is there a mix shift that\u2019s happening? ","Obviously, we are seeing much larger contribution from the mid-range than the high-end, and we know the ASPs are not the same? Are you seeing a big discrepancy in terms of your next shipments versus the revenues that you are posting over the last few quarters specific to TD-LTE?","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay, let me try to that. I think Jon has tried twice. Let me -- there were two separate elements here. One is in the previous cycle there was a shortage of other components and as a result because the customers got everything they needed from us they are now absorbing that. ","And -- but in terms of the number, that was not a disappointment for us. So the overall number was in line with what we had expected. But the -- with regards to the third phase which is about to start that is delayed and that is delayed in our estimate by about quarter vis-\u00e0-vis what we had expected.","It's not in the overall number, it's just in the timing and we do expect that help drive the business and it should drive our business starting from the December quarter and that will generate renewed growth, driven by China LTE.","Now, all of the other businesses are starting to catch up and actually Jon commented about the growth we've seen in wired communication in 28-nanometer and that\u2019s growing at a slower rate, but it is happening. And that's more or less on track to continue over the next few quarters, right?","So if you look the overall margin if you look at the overall margins, wherever there's a surge in wireless then you see a small dip in the overall margins and when there is a pause in wireless you see the margin go up at a faster rate. So that's what -- that explains that and it\u2019s the tightest element or the thing that is the percentage of wireless business.","But as Jon pointed out this is this is well beyond Kintex this point in time. We are shipping a lot all of the families this point including Virtex and that's actually growing relatively faster as opposed to Kintex which was primarily driven by wireless requirement. Does that help?","Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co.","It adds a lot of color. Thank you very much.","Moshe Gavrielov","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","And I have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to you, Mr. Muscha. ","Rick Muscha","Great. Thanks for joining us today. We have playback of this call beginning at 5 PM Pacific Time, 8 PM Eastern Time today. For a copy of our earnings release, please visit our IR website. Our next earnings release date for the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 will be Wednesday, October 15th after the market close. ","This quarter we will be presenting at the Citi Global Technology Conference in New York on September 3rd and the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on September 10th in Las Vegas. ","This completes our call. Thank you very much for your participation. ","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. "]}}
