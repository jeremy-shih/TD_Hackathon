Today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. P&G has posted on its Web site, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. July to September was a challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with slowing market growth in both developed and developing regions. Strong foreign exchange headwinds, market level challenges in the Ukraine, Russia and the Middle East, Venezuela, Argentina, and Hong Kong, and increased consumption taxes in several large markets including Japan and Mexico. Despite this we were able to deliver top and bottom-line results for the July-September quarter, which were in line with our going-in expectations.","Organic sales grew 2% and were in line or ahead of year ago in all reporting segments. Organic volume was in line with the prior year, pricing added more than a point to sales growth and sales mix was positive. All-in sales were roughly equal to prior year including more than a point of headwind from foreign exchange and the impact of brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $1.07, up 2% versus the prior year. Excluding FX, core earnings per share grew 9%. Core gross margin was up 20 basis points, cost savings up approximately 140 basis points and benefits from pricing were partially offset by foreign exchange, higher commodity costs, innovation and capacity investments and negative margin mix. Core SG&A cost as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points, 70 basis points of overhead savings and 50 basis points of marketing savings were more than offset by foreign exchange impacts and investments in R&D and selling capabilities.","Total productivity savings in cost of goods sold and SG&A were 260 basis points. Core operating margin was down 20 basis points versus the prior year. The effective tax rate on core earnings was about 23% nearly 2 points higher than the fiscal year guidance of about 21%. September quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.69, which includes approximately $0.03 per share of non-core restructuring charges, $0.04 per share of charges related to a change in the exchange rate at which certain historical Venezuela and receivables will be paid, and a penny per share of benefit from earnings of the discontinued Pet Care operations, also included is a $0.32 per share non-core, non-cash charge to write down goodwill and certain intangibles of our Battery business.","Duracell is a strong brand equity in Personal Power, an attractive business but we are writing the asset down to be more reflective of the value we'll receive and they recently announced sale of our interest in the Nanfu Battery joint venture. We generated $3.6 billion in operating cash flow and $2.8 billion in free cash flow with 96% adjusted free cash flow productivity, reflecting our focus on balanced growth and value creation. This quarter is the best first quarter cash performance in the past five years, improved results on payables including good progress on our supply chain financing program was a main driver of the strong cash performance. We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareholders including 1.8 billion in dividends and 2.4 billion in share repurchase.","In summary, first quarter sales and core earnings growth were in line with going-in expectations and we continue to build on our strong track-record of cash productivity and cash return to shareholders.","We expect the headwinds facing our industry to continue. We are consequently continuing to sharpen our strategies, accelerate and increase productivity savings and strengthen our execution. As we announced last quarter, we\u2019re taking an important strategy step-forward to streamline, simplify and strengthen the Company\u2019s business and brand portfolio. We will become a simplifier and more focused company of 70 to 80 category-leading competitively-advantaged brands organized into about a dozen business units and four industry-based sectors.","We\u2019ll compete in businesses that are structurally attractive and play to P&G\u2019s strengths, where we can achieve sustainable advantage. Every brand we plan to keep is strategic with a potential to grow and create value. The core 70 to 80 brands are leaders in their industries, categories or segments. They are brands shoppers buy, consumers use and customers support. They\u2019re leaders in brand equity, awareness, trial, purchase and loyalty. They\u2019re leaders in product performance and product innovation, and leaders in growth and value-creation.","Over the next 18 to 24 months we will create a faster growing more profitable Company that is far simpler to operate. In the September we complete the exit of the Pet Care business. We closed the divestiture of the Americas Pet business to Mars in July. Mars then executed their option to purchase the business in Asia and last month we signed an agreement to divest the European Pet business to Spectrum Brands. All remaining elements of these transactions should close in calendar year 2015, pending regulatory approval.","We generated very good value in this three-stage transaction earning more than a 20x EBITDA multiple on past three year average results. The Pet Care exit transitions seven brands to new owners. In total over the last five quarter we have divested discontinued or made decisions to consolidate about 25 brands. Today we are announcing the exit of the Personal Power or Battery business. Our goals in this process are to maximize value to P&G\u2019s shareholders and minimize earnings per share dilution. There are two steps to this plan. In late August we finalized an agreement to sell our interest in a China-based battery joint venture in a cash transaction. The second step is the exit of the Duracell business. Although no decision has been on the form of exit, our preference is currently a split-off of the Duracell business into a standalone company. Duracell is the global battery market leader with attractive operating profit margins. It\u2019s a brand equity and products innovation leader in the category with a history of strong cash generation. It will receive greater priority and attention as its own company.","If we choose to pursue a split-off transaction P&G shareholders will be given the option of exchanging some, none or all of their shares, for P&G for shares in the newly formed Duracell Company. P&G\u2019s outstanding share count would be reduced by the number of P&G shares exchanged. The exact exchange ratio will be set just prior to the completion of the transaction which we expect will occur in the second half of calendar 2015. While a split-off is our preference, any alternative exit scenario that generates equal or better value will be fully considered. We are developing incremental savings plans to offset standard overheads that remain in our core cost structure to minimize the dilutive impact of exiting the Duracell business. For the time being, Duracell will continue to be reported in our core results.","As we continue to strengthen our category and brand portfolio, we will strengthen and focus our brand building and product innovation efforts and investments against our biggest opportunities. We are committed to be the brand and product innovation leader in the categories in which we compete. Year-after-year, decade-after-decade successful brand building and supported by product innovation has built our businesses, transformed our categories and created entirely new businesses. Innovation, vast commoditization stimulates category growth and builds accumulative advantage of our brands overtime.","With branding and product innovation, we built leading positions in laundry and many markets. In the U.S. we have nearly a 60% share of the U.S. laundry market sales and earn about 85% of the profit in cash generated in the category. We launched our North American Fabric Care brand and product innovation bundle about 8 months ago and upgraded Tide Plus line up that make our best liquid detergents even better. Gain Flings that accelerate consumer conversion to new premium unit dose detergents. Tide Simply Clean & Fresh that provides value to our consumers and new and better option from a brand they aspire to use, new sizes in scents of Downy Unstopables and Gain Fireworks, and the addition of Bounce Bursts to the scent portfolio.","Innovations like these build on the consumer and competitive advantages our brands have created over decades. Innovations like these enable us to earn a leading share of market sales and an even greater share of market profit and value creation. Innovations like these stimulate market growth. They spark new consumer interest in the category and grow market baskets. They trade consumers up to higher performing products. Tide Pods and Gain Flings are priced at more than double the average price per load in the detergent category, and are still very affordable for the vast majority of consumer households.","Over the last 30 years the price of a load of laundry has lagged the price of cheese or eggs and is a much better value than a cup of coffee or a bottle of soda. The U.S. category\u2019s two biggest laundry brands Tide and Gain have each grown market share over the past 4, 13, 26 and 52 week periods. Tide value share was up 2 points for the quarter. Tide Simply Clean & Fresh is nearly a 3 share with cannibalization results better than expected. Distribution of Simply Clean & Fresh continues to grow with a top U.S. retailer expanding to full national distribution earlier this month. P&G\u2019s unit dose business across Tide and Gain is 9% share of the total U.S. detergent market. We have over 75% share of the unit dose form. We are continuing to leverage our consumer preferred unit dose form with Tide Free & Gentle Pods which started shipping in July.","Just over a year ago we introduced a broad range of Baby Care products innovation in North America. Nearly every Diaper across all sizes and price peers was improved to deliver better absorbency, comfort or design. Our premium mom preferred Diaper design Swaddlers was extended in the sizes 4 and 5 and subsequently size 6. P&G\u2019s U.S. market-leading Diaper share is now nearly 44%, up more than 3 points versus a year ago.","On a global basis, P&G has about 35% of the global Diaper share and earns about half the profit in the category. We\u2019ve built this leading Baby Diaper business despite the absence of a consumer preferred pant style Diaper offering. We\u2019re now launching Pampers Premium Care Pants beginning in Russia. Pampers Pants provides exceptional skin comfort and dryness benefits in an underwear-like design, that should add to cumulative products and equity advantages we\u2019ve established with Pampers.","Gillette has a long history of innovation, blades and razors that reset the performance standards in the industry. Overtime, we\u2019ve earned nearly a 70% share of blades and razor sales globally and a 90% share of value and profit. ProGlide FlexBall our newest innovation is the first razor designed to respond to the contours of men\u2019s face, maintaining maximum contact and delivering a closer and more complete and comfortable shave. Every man has a different shaped face, One Gillette FlexBall and cartridge delivers a uniquely better, closer, more comfortable shave for everyone.","Prelaunch testing indicated men preferred FlexBall 2:1 versus the bestselling razor in the world our own Fusion ProGlide. Post-launch men who have used FlexBall indicate closer to a 90% preference rate. Trial has come from across the category with an encouraging 25% from disposable users. In the four months since launch, we\u2019ve seen an improvement in U.S. blades and razors market growth including more than a 25% spike in razor sales and have seen sequential improvement in our razor shares over the past 12, 6, and 3 month periods.","Gillette earned nearly 80% of the male razor sales and nearly 90% of male cartridge sales in the U.S. last quarter. We\u2019ll begin the global expansion of ProGlide FlexBall early next calendar year. Also next year, we\u2019ll extend our breakthrough FlexBall technology to women with our market-leading Venus brand. FlexBall offers clear benefits to women helping them to easily manage tricky spots such as knees and ankles. Women who have tried the new razor love it, preferring it 3:1 over the current global bestselling women\u2019s razor Venus Embrace.","We believe we can grow the adult incontinence category with innovation, transform the desired consumer experience and increase consumer, customer and shareholder value. This is currently an attractive $7 billion global category growing in an annual rate of 7%. Women aren\u2019t satisfied with current product offerings 1 in 3 women over 18 years old suffers from incontinence, but only 1 in 9 uses an adult incontinence product of any kind. That spells consumer dissatisfaction which spells opportunity for P&G.","We\u2019re entering the category with superior pad and pant-style products that deliver better fit and protection from Always, a brand that women trust and prefer. We began shipments of Always Discreet in the UK in July where market growth is accelerated by 20% since our launch. We have quickly grown to over 9% value share. We started shipping Always Discreet in North America and France in August in less than two full months in the market. The U.S. adult incontinence market growth rate has accelerated to 10% and we\u2019ve grown to over a 7% value share.","Last month, we launched Crest Sensi-Stop Strips providing unprecedented tooth sensitivity relief. Unlike toothpaste that takes several weeks to reduce sensitivity and need to be used twice per day, one Sensi-Stop Strip applied for 10 minutes provides immediate relief and up to one month of protection from sensitivity pain for sound consumers. This is another significant market growth opportunity, nearly 60% of American\u2019s suffer from sensitive teeth, but only 4 in 10 are satisfied with their available sensitivity product solutions. Our focus now is on driving awareness and trial of this revolutionary new treatment for tooth sensitivity sufferers.","In July, we introduced QlearQuil a product innovation that extends Vicks into allergy treatments. This innovation leverages a very strong and trusted Vicks band equity across a variety of products including nighttime, daytime and 24-hour treatments. QlearQuil is a great product for the numerous occasional sinus and allergy sufferers who only want relief when they need it and don\u2019t want or need everyday preventative dosing.","In September, we launched a new bundle of Metamucil brand. This includes a base brand restage of Metamucil fiber with a new satiety benefit of helps you feel less hungry between meals. In addition to its current heart health, blood sugar and digestive health benefits. Meta Bars our new fiber bar form that fit with consumer lifestyles and capitalize on the rapid growth of the health bar, meal supplement and snack category. MetaBiotic is a new probiotic that puts Meta into the fast growing immunity benefit space.","As I said earlier, we\u2019re committed to be the brand and product innovation leader in our categories and we\u2019re increasing investment behind it. The best companies in any industry find a way to lead brand, product and business model innovation and productivity, returning productivity into core strength of P&G, making it a systemic and enduring value creation pillar alongside innovation. We have significantly accelerated and will significantly exceed the $10 billion cross savings goal we set 2.5 years ago. We\u2019re driving cost of goods savings well above the original target run rate of $1.2 billion per year. We\u2019ll be above target again this year for the third consecutive year with strong savings across materials, manufacturing expense and logistics.","We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% again this year, reducing staffing even as we add capacity and start-up new production modules. We have begun work and what is probably the biggest supply chain redesign in the Company\u2019s history moving from primarily single-category production sites to fewer multi-category production plans. The supply chains will be informed, excuse me the supply chain plans will be informed by portfolio decisions that we have made. We build the supply chain around the future portfolio, not the one we have today.","We are taking the opportunity to simplify, standardize and upgrade manufacturing platforms. For faster innovation, qualification and expansion and improved product quality. We are transforming our distribution network in the United States consolidating customer shipments into fewer distribution centers. These centers are strategically located closer to key customers and key population centers enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper. We now have two our new U.S. distribution centers up and running and we will open the other four in early 2015.","Earlier this month, we announced steps to streamline our distribution network in France, consolidating to fewer larger distribution centers. The distribution network projects will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels, while still improving service and on-shop availability and reducing in-store out-of-stocks.","We have now established a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation target for our global supply chain reinvention effort. We have doubled the associated cost of goods savings target from this global effort from 200 million to 300 million up to 400 million to 600 million in annual savings building to this target level over the next three years to five years. These savings are incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we originally communicated and are on-track to exceed.","We expect addition top and bottom-line benefits from improved service levels. We have reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by 16% in three years, enabled by several important organization design choices. We have organized around four industry-based sectors, we are streamlining and de-duplicating the work of business units and selling operations. We have consolidated a four brand building functions into one. Each of these changes reduces complexity and each creates clear accountability for performance and results. A more focused portfolio of brands and businesses will enable further changes.","In the first quarter, we again reduced enrollment versus the prior quarter despite the addition of many of this year\u2019s new hires to our enrollment ranks. We have additional opportunity to improve marketing efficiency in both media and non-media areas, while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and the strength of our programs. We continue to drive marketing productivity through an optimized mix driven by new, more efficient digital, mobile and social media.","We are making targeted reinvestments to support strong innovation. We increased marketing support behind the Tide brand in the U.S. by 60 basis points last year, and increased Campus market in the U.S. by 230 basis points. As we generate efficiencies, we will look for good opportunities to put some of those savings back to work to improve top-line growth.","The final priority that I will touch on this morning is execution. The only strategy our consumers and customers actually see. We are bringing a renewed focus to brands, building leadership brands with iconic equities that become the prototype in their categories, consistent expression of the brand promise with ideas that attract consumers to the brand\u2019s superior benefit. Create trial, ongoing preference and lasting loyalty. Building trial with targeted advertising and sampling is a significant opportunity for many of our brands. For example thousands of recent male high school graduates will receive ProGlide FlexBall razors.","The babies in the 80% to 90% of new moms in the U.S. will try Pampers while they are in the hospital. Many buyers and new dishwashers or a cloth washing machines will have to opportunity to try our best Cascade and Tide product innovations. We are focusing selling resources to improve coverage, expertise and execution in the key retail channels wholesalers and distributors that make a difference. This will lead to improve distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution to consistently win at the first moment of truth.","We are and will continue to increase the amount of sector and category dedication of our salesforce to improve category expertise and tenure and increase channel coverage. Improving our branding and selling execution will be significantly enabled by the business and brand portfolio focus we have embarked on.","The strategic strengthening of our portfolio, innovation investment in core categories, strengthened and accelerated productivity efforts and stronger marketing and selling execution should enhance our results. We are operating though in an extremely difficult macro environment with an increasing number of issues. In Russia, the Ukraine, the Middle East, Argentina and Venezuela with the dollar that continues to strengthen, with markets that continue to decelerate and with increasing commodity cost despite lower crude oil prices.","We are making targeted investments in our value equations and are increasing the level of investment in our brands and product innovation. With all this considered, we are maintaining previous organic sales and core earnings per share guidance ranges, while we work to try to offset the macro headwinds with more productivity savings, pricing for FX and market accretive innovation-enabled top-line growth.","Our forecast for organic sales growth remains at a range of low to mid single-digits. We now expect foreign exchange to be a negative 2 point impact on sales growth and a 5 to 6 point headwind on core earnings per share growth. This is roughly double the impact we had estimated last quarter. We\u2019re maintaining our core earnings per share growth guidance range of mid single-digits while FX currently skews us towards the lower end of this range, we will do our best to try to offset these impacts with productivity savings and pricing, without comprising increased investments and brand equities, value equations, innovation and selling capability. This is what we were able to successfully do last year.","Excluding FX we\u2019re now forecasting double-digit core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. On an all-in GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to be down 2% to 5% versus the prior fiscal year including approximately $0.55 per share of non-core items, mainly $0.20 per of non-core restructuring costs and a $0.32 impairment charge.","We\u2019re targeting to deliver about 90% free cash flow productivity. We plan to offset additional capital investments with continued working capital improvements. We plan to return this cash to shareowners through dividend payments of about 7 billion and share repurchase in the range of 5 billion to 7 billion.","Our guidance is based on mid-October foreign exchange, spot rates. Further significant currency weakness including Venezuela is not anticipated within our guidance range. Our outlook is based on current market growth rates which we\u2019re monitoring closely. We also continue to monitor unrest in several markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where pricing controls, import restrictions and access to dollars present risk.","The guidance does not assume any impact from major portfolio moves, including the sale of the Nanfu Battery joint venture. We\u2019ll update guidance for Nanfu one it closes and we\u2019ll update for other transactions as they are decided and completed.","There are few things you should keep in mind as you construct your models for the remainder of the year. Our top-line comps are more difficult in the second quarter versus the back of the year. Benefits from new pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts at Venezuela and other markets will build throughout the year.","We expect significant top and bottom-line headwinds from foreign exchange in the October-December quarter. At current FX rates, we will annualize a portion of the FX headwinds in the back half and productivity savings will build as the year progresses. We look forward to talking with you more about our strategies, plans and progress, and engaging with you on your questions at our Analyst Meeting here in Cincinnati on November 12th and 13th.","That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided on our press release and will be available in slides which we have posted on our Web site www.pg.com following the call.","Now, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Good morning, Jon. You walked through a lot of new innovation in your prepared remarks and it\u2019s notable considering that this is the first time in a few years that mix has actually contributed to top-line growth, but meanwhile volume continues to be flattish again, so perhaps can you talk through how you think about the contributors to top-line growth going forward? And then following on that can you tell us what the breakout was in U.S. growth versus emerging markets and given slowing macros can you talk about how growth progressed through the quarter? Thank you very much.","Jon Moeller","I\u2019ll try to remember all of that Olivia. In terms of the contributors of top-line growth as you said volume was relatively flat and mix was uncharacteristically positive. We expect going forward to resume volume growth. We will have some benefit from pricing. I would expect mix to be neutral to negative as it has typically been and as we have said it will be. There will be some volatility by quarter and clearly innovation will be a significant driver of our growth, but as importantly base brand execution and brand building where we have significant opportunities also represent some opportunities for growth.","So that\u2019s kind of without getting really specific how we\u2019re thinking about driving growth forward. And I think it\u2019s important that we just step back a minute in the midst of some of the macro difficulties and reflect on opportunities for growth. Developing markets are still growing mid to high single-digits depending on the market, so while growth rates in our view are 1 to 2 points lower than they were a year ago, there is still a lot of opportunity there. And there are significant opportunities in developed markets.","It\u2019s very early but we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of uptick in the market growth rates in North America, presumably driven by lower unemployment, wage rates just beginning to increase and lower gasoline prices and hopefully that continues. But even if that doesn\u2019t, there are still significant opportunities for growth in developed markets. Just one example, think about the Asian demographic there are 10,000 Americans everyday crossing the 65 years old line and we talked in our prepared remarks about the adult incontinence opportunity. The tooth sensitivity opportunity with Crest Sensi-Stop Strips is also should benefit from that demographic shift and even things like Tide PODS which are more convenient from a carrying and handling standpoint for older body\u2019s enhance, will help us benefit from that demographic change. So we continue to be very aware of the challenges we face but very hopeful about the opportunities that are in front of us.","In terms of the split developed and developing, both North America and developed market\u2019s total were essentially flat on the quarter in terms of organic sales growth with developing up 4%.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Gross margin performance clearly improved in the quarter it was up for the first in a year and a half year-over-year. And I am guessing it was probably better or ahead of what you guys expected. Can you discuss the key drivers behind that in terms of the sequential gross margin improvement? And if you think that\u2019s sustainable going forward. And then also just wanted to get an update on the drag you are experiencing from emerging markets growth in terms of gross margin mix, and the progress you expect to make in emerging markets over the next couple of years on gross margins with more localized manufacturing?","Jon Moeller","","The biggest driver as you would expect of the gross margin improvement was the productivity savings, which were about 140 basis points. There was also less difference if you will between developing market growth rates and developed market growth rates. So part of the answer going forward depends on that dynamic. And there was also an offset from foreign exchange. So the dynamics going forward also depend on that dynamic. We continue to focus on improving the profitability in developing markets, so that growth there becomes less of a gross margin drag.","If you look the last two years and then what we are projecting this year, two years ago we grew constant currency profits in developing markets 2 times faster than sales. Last year we grew them 4 times faster than sales. This year we are forecasting again to be about double the rate of sales growth. So we are very intentional and very deliberate in our efforts to improve developing market margins to a point where they are not as much of a drag on mix. But we are very happy with the gross margin performance. We delivered I think on a fiscal year basis while we will continue to be volatile by quarter. We should continue to see progress.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","When you announced in August that you were going through this portfolio rationalization process, you said that you wouldn\u2019t be selling billion dollar brands basically and yet now we are getting the divestiture of the spin of Duracell. So my question is, does the target for the 10% number of sales that you are going to be exiting now go up to kind of 12% to 13% when you include Duracell or has there been some change in how you build off to that 10? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","","You are right Wendy in referring to the Pareto of brands that we talked about that we have been re-divesting and we said there were many that were much smaller than they were those that were bigger. But we didn\u2019t say that there wouldn\u2019t be any large ones, if we did that was a misstatement. But in terms of taking the number up, no this is part of the plan and as I said we are about 25% of the way through the plan through the end of the quarter this is additive to that. So we continue to make progress against that originally articulated plan. There will be some larger businesses but the majority will be small. And I apologize if we miss-communicated that previously.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stipe with Credit Suisse.","Michael Stipe - Credit Suisse","Just following on Duracell, why even though you have taken a decision to exit this business now, is it still included in the ongoing operations? And then related to that, at what point you are going to sort of tell us what level of operating profit you are essentially loosing by exiting that business? And then secondly, are there significant stranded overhead costs that you are expecting in that disposal process?","Jon Moeller","","U.S. GAAP accounting requirements require that we account for something in a split-off context in continuing operations until a split-off is executed. And that\u2019s why it remains in continuing operations. But as we execute the split-off or as we were to sign any other agreement the business would move into discontinued operations at that time.","In terms of stranded overhead there is some overhead that this business is absorbing. As we talked in the last quarter we are going to do our best to offset that to help minimize dilution. And in terms of what the dilution will ultimately be, it\u2019s really too early to give you helpful guidance on that, because a lot of that\u2019s going to depend on what form the transaction ultimately takes. It will depend on the amount of shares that are exchanged and that exchange ratio which won\u2019t be said until closer to the transaction itself. So we will try to keep you updated as we have information. But right now it would be a pretty wide range. But again I think the takeaway is that we are committed both through the form of the transaction and through our efforts to reduce standard overhead to minimize that dilution number.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Jon can you talk a little bit more about the kind of the commodity basket and what you see over the next remainder of fiscal \u201915 and clearly with oil coming down and diesel trades other than should be a tailwind, but you kind of allude to there are some other headwinds so just trying to see what\u2019s you\u2019re seeing and what the next inflation will be this year?","Jon Moeller","Yes, we\u2019re certainly hopeful that this becomes a tailwind overtime, but it takes awhile for instance crude reductions to work their way through the refineries and there is a bit of a bottleneck right now in refining capacity in parts of the world, which is why we\u2019re not seeing the immediate flow through into our commodity cost base. So our commodities currently are about a 2 to 3 point headwind versus last year and we\u2019re seeing some moderation in a small decline for instance in diesel prices and hopefully that continues, but we still have resins and polypropylenes due to the dynamic I mentioned earlier, up fairly significantly versus year ago. So hopefully that 2 to 3 point headwind is a worse case number and hopefully we get some help as things continue to evolve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Two quick questions, well one quick one probably a little bit longer. First off can you talk a little bit about the sustainability of the working capital improvement that you saw this quarter, there was a nice benefit year-over-year? And then the second question relates to the mix from a margin standpoint obviously it was better this quarter because emerging markets got worse let\u2019s say, you know, but can you talk about some of the margin improvements you can make outside the U.S. and outside of developed markets that will create a little less margin pressure particularly on the operating profit line as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks John. On the sustainability of working capital improvement side, I view them as very sustainable. Cash is one of our clear focus areas and we have some strong plans that are continuing to make progress. The progress that we made in the quarter that we just reported was driven primarily by the supply chain financing program which has future benefits associated with it. We\u2019re not all of our way through that yet and those benefits are sustainable going forward.","On top of that, as we execute our portfolio focusing program, there is a significant opportunity that we\u2019re committed to go after once we have rationalized the category and brand portfolio at the skew level and that also presents a significant inventory and working capital opportunity the bottom 5% of our skews in terms of movement not surprisingly account for a much greater percentage of our inventory, so as we get after that, there should be a benefit.","And third as I mentioned in our supply chain redesign efforts, we\u2019re hopeful we can take significant levels of inventory out of the total system and at the same time decrease shelf out-of-stocks, improve customer service. So there are a number of big drivers that we should have available to us to continue to make progress in that area, which we\u2019re committed to do impart to offset the impact of some of the capital spending that we\u2019re doing in the supply chain redesign on a global basis.","In terms of what we can do in developing markets to reduce the margin mix impact, as I mentioned in an answer to a prior question, we\u2019re making significant progress in this area on a constant currency basis. 2x the rate of organic sales growth, two years ago 4x last year at least 2x again this year, also some of the developing market investments that we made for instance the Oral Care investments, those are beginning to accrete and that should be a source of help going forward.","The productivity savings are not simply a developed market dynamic. They are equally a developing market dynamic on items like TDC, items like marketing even in the non-manufacturing overhead arena. And then as you know we\u2019re also increasingly localizing our production. We\u2019ll be bringing some of the same redesign to parts of the developing world that we\u2019re doing in the developed world today at least from a distribution center standpoint. And so I see no reason why longer term developing markets margin should be a significant drag on earning though they will continue to be a negative drag in the near-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities","Jon, I guess, can you talk a little bit about beauty, I guess in particular can you go through Pantene U.S. which the scanner data looks a little better recently and then also Olay U.S. your skincare in general U.S. skincare in China? And then I guess maybe elaborate on the Prestige comments you made in the press release that\u2019d be great?","Jon Moeller","So if you look at beauty parts of that business are doing a fairly well. We grew antiperspirant and deodorant mid single-digits, cosmetics grew organic sales mid single-digits in the quarter with Max Factor growing shipments on a double-digit basis globally. Safeguard was growing mid single-digits globally with double-digit growth in parts of the developing world. And we had a pretty strong quarter on Hugo Boss which is largest Prestige fragrance. Hair Care grew about 2% in the quarter. We were very encouraged by the developments that you point out on Pantene in the U.S. where volume was up 11% on the quarter. As I have cautioned before this will be not be a straight line and competitive intensity in this category is significant, but still forward progress is encouraging. Olay remains work in progress. We are making some good progress in addressing some of the consumer benefit segments that we had neglected and that are important in the category with items like Luminous with the items like Fresh Effects. But we still have work to do both in North America and in China. But sequentially quarter-on-quarter better results in beauty from a top-line standpoint and we are hopeful we can continue that.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","A couple of questions, just to sort of drill down more in the U.S. can you just talk about some of the price interventions you discussed last quarter if they are done yet and kind of where they happened. And then some of the personnel changes in the U.S. and your views on the sustainability of the U.S. recovery. I know it\u2019s like very nascent but curious why you think things are improving and then maybe how long you think it will last? And then lastly just urgency on some of the share losses in China and if you saw any material distributor destocking in any of the major emerging markets? Sorry for the long question.","Jon Moeller","","Obviously pricing is a sensitive topic, so I don\u2019t want to get into really granular specifics. But we did mention that we had made value equation interventions in both the laundry and the paper products businesses specifically tissue towel and toilet paper. And those appear to have been going pretty well. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks we have built share on a almost in a period of time you can look at it in the last 52 weeks on both Gain and Tide. Tide was up 2 points in the quarter. And so we will continue. We need to be competitive on pricing, we will continue to be competitive. But I think we are pretty much where we need to be. I don\u2019t see, of course this changes on a daily basis. But as we sit here today, I don\u2019t see any additional significant moves that need to be made.","In terms of personnel, look we are just taking advantage of normal retirement and normal attrition to design the organization that\u2019s going to lead this more focused more strategically-oriented company for a balanced growth and value creation. And that\u2019s what we are doing. We are going to have a management team that\u2019s going to manage this company that would be the same size as the team that existed in 2000 managing a company that\u2019s 2x or actually more than 2x the size of the company in 2000. And that\u2019s the design intent.","In terms of China, China continues to be an attractive market in our view it\u2019s market where we\u2019ve grown over 50% in the last four years. Market growth continues, the last quarter based on our look at our categories market growth was up was about 6%. Our inventories are pretty much inline throughout the trade chain. So we really have not I would view those destocking dynamics as company specific rather than systemic.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers - UBS","I was hoping maybe just to step back and put this quarter in a better context of all the improvement efforts that you are doing, clearly there is lots of things that you have done internally over the 12 months that you summarized and that you view as positive in the re-org the supply chain restructuring. Overall productivity focus you build the brand refocusing initiative et cetera. I think all that\u2019s good. But despite that and despite the innovation successes and the brand strength that you ran through organic growth is still only rounding up to 2%. Only two of the divisions grew this quarter. And I guess that improved focus overtime an easier compares going forward should help but even many of the core brands you attempt to retain remain pretty sluggish and have been so for some time. So I guess in that context what are you planning to do to change that paradigm. Is it truly all about the better execution that you mentioned or they are things that consumers currently want from P&G in certain areas that you are not delivering? Because I am trying to discern how much you can do to reaccelerate growth on your own versus how much such improvement is just more dependent on macro improvement? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","","There is a lot that we can do on our own. And that\u2019s why I talked about the whole brand building and selling execution opportunity, that\u2019s completely within our control. And I mentioned the sampling opportunities. We have opportunities to continue to improve the quality and clarity of our communication with consumers. We have significant opportunities which the supply chain redesign will help us address at the first moment of truth just in terms of out-of-stocks. And generally while market growths have slowed, consumers continue to be very responsive to innovation that increases the value of the product that they are purchasing.","If we\u2019d look at the segments of our business that are growing the fastest, and I\u2019ve talked about some of them in the opening remarks, many of those are premium priced items but come with product superiority and consumer benefit that more than justifies that price. And put simply, we believe that the antidote to relatively slow overall market sales or market growth is threefold, it\u2019s innovation, it\u2019s productivity, and it\u2019s execution. And I would be remised if I didn't mention in this context that to the point of the prior question we still have work to do on our beauty business and on couple of other pockets of the business, and that should also as we improve that make a significant different in our ability to grow not just at but ahead of -- slightly ahead of market growth rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","May be just buck up on that a bit and let\u2019s maybe focus on grooming because when you talk about some of the sampling opportunities some of them sounded familiar like things you\u2019ve always done, the babies in the hospital get Pampers, you\u2019ve got incredible reach there, sending razors to boys when they turn 18, that dynamic so that\u2019s not necessarily new, so we focus a bit on grooming, right, that\u2019s the trial opportunity. You had massive innovation with FlexBall, you gave some really positive statistics on the impact on the market yet few organic sales growth of the business was flat and it was all pricing and volume was down, so just maybe focus on a particular business what was missing, if FlexBall has been so successful thus far what\u2019s missing that these numbers are numbers still so weak? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Well I think there and it\u2019s very early and you can imagine that most men have an inventory of blades at home that they have to work through before the real driver of growth in that market which is cartridge consumption takes place, but we\u2019re beginning to see an increase now in cartridge market share. We\u2019re up about 1.4 points in the quarter. We\u2019re also beginning to see a reduction in the rate of market decline in the grooming segment. It was down as much as 6% to 7%. Previously, it\u2019s down about 3% on a more recent basis and as low as past 1% in a couple of the recent months. And remember as well that the FlexBall innovation is not only new to market it\u2019s only in one country serving one gender. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019ll begin globalizing this over the balance of, starting in calendar year 2015.","We\u2019ll bring the truly superior benefit of this product to women as well, and so we\u2019re early days in that whole dynamic. Also remember that when we sell an initiative which we did with FlexBall in the last quarter, there is an inherent acceleration of sales into the quarter as we work to stock the shelves and fill the supply chain. So grooming organic growth last quarter was 7%. If you look at it on a two quarter average basis, which I think is a more representative way to look at it given the initiative dynamics it\u2019s in pretty good shape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","How many more businesses are there in your portfolio like the one in China that led to almost billion dollar non-cash impairment charge?","Jon Moeller","As you can imagine, we do impairment testing on a routine basis. We disclosed in our last K that that there was some risk on the Duracell evaluation that we had very cushion. And then the selling price that we generated and the impacts of decision to sell, which frankly changed some of the impairment testing criteria led to that impairment. You will notice in our disclosures that there are no other businesses that we\u2019re disclosing a similar risk on it doesn\u2019t mean there will never be one, but as we sit here today actually that is very low risk.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","So I just wanted to tack onto Bill Schmitz\u2019s question regarding the personnel changes, and if you could just talk about just along two vectors, one is just near-term disruption and how we should be thinking about that as you have new folks kind of getting into new roles and getting up the learning curve? And then the second question is as you streamline P&G\u2019s decision makers and operating model, have you thought about changing incentive structures and anyway, shape or form just to kind of get people focused on the right behaviors and the right geographies and the right product categories? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So I am not terribly concerned about near-term disruption. I think it\u2019s a fair question Nick, but there are many more people continuing to do their jobs and people changing jobs. And the people that are changing jobs are better and experienced pros in almost every case. So it\u2019s something that we need to stay deliberate and intentional on, not dropping any balls. But I am really that concerned about that. Again it\u2019s, I meant no way to dismiss the question I think it\u2019s a very fair question. But I think we are in a good shape. In terms of rewards and incentives that\u2019s something that we are always looking at, that\u2019s something that the Compensation Committee at the Board is always looking at. I don\u2019t have a specific change to announce today, but it\u2019s something that continues to receive the appropriate levels of attention.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","","I would like to circle back on an earlier question on beauty. Specifically Prestige I don\u2019t think I heard you discuss the drivers of weakness there. And I was hopeful you could elaborate. And then more broadly based on your 10-K disclosures this has been a business with pretty inconsistent performance in the past and obviously it serves a non-core retail customer for you. So in that context can you walk us through the rational and maybe the puts and takes of why either should or shouldn\u2019t be considered in your portfolio rationalization initiatives?","Jon Moeller","","Thanks for re-asking the question on the trends in the quarter. Jason I appreciate that I, Bill asked such a long question I\u2019d forgotten that part. And that is not a dig on you Bill. The biggest driver frankly is a base period dynamic where we had a strong innovation on both Gucci and Lacoste in the year ago quarter and there was less of that this quarter. As you can understand maybe not appreciate, I really don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time talking about specific businesses and their role in the portfolio as we are going through all that changes that we are going through. We will announce moves and decisions as they occur and we will try to be very clear as to what the rationale is. And I will leave it there.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Jon a question on the savings and your decision of having double-digit earnings growth in this environment, okay currency neutral, could you tell us how much savings you striked at this quarter. And remind us what is the target for the year? And to what extent there is reinvestment allocated in these double-digit earnings growth target at this stage of the turnaround. My peers are alluding to the very low top-line growth the 2%? Okay, thank you.","Jon Moeller","","Thank you, Javier. In the quarter there were about 250 basis points of savings across cost of goods and SG&A. And a not insignificant portion of that was reinvested. I talked about the investment levels that we have increased behind Tide when we have strong innovation. We are going to invest behind it. We did the same on Pampers and have continued spending to drive that business increase consumer awareness, increase household penetration. I also mentioned that I didn\u2019t give it a lot of time so I understand how we could have crossed over it. But we are being very intentional in reinvesting in two areas. One in the SRA area, one is in R&D to bring even more innovation to market that\u2019s more relevant for consumers and it improves realize in an even stronger way and in our selling execution assuring that we have got sufficient channel coverage in the channels that are growing in that matter ensuring that we have an appropriate level of category knowledge and dedication. So we will reinvest when there are good opportunities and which we feel we can drive a strong return.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan, from Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus","","I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question on beauty and Prestige in particular. Curious about the recently announced decision to consolidate leadership of the salon and global Prestige units under one person, is there a change to how the company is thinking about managing one or both of those units? And then also just quickly anything to read into in the change in the name of that beauty hair and now personal care segment from beauty previously?","Jon Moeller","","I am not in any way trying to back hand the answer to that question. But there is really not a lot of significance in either of those. This is Patrice Louvet that you are referring to will be managing those three businesses. He has a strong track-record within the Company. He has managed our fragrance business our Prestige business previously. And he is going to be great going forward.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Hi good morning. My question is about what you think your category growth rate was globally in the quarter. I am trying to figure out if you gained or lost share in this quarter? And then are still holding the category growth rate of 2% to 3% for fiscal \u201915? And has there been any change in your outlook for category growth rate in the U.S. versus emerging regions for this year? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Okay, so overall category growth rate was 2.5% and that\u2019s kind what we\u2019re expecting. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re basing our guidance on the current market growth rates we see which are those. I also mention that we are -- sorry I might have not mentioned, but we\u2019re seeing a slight uptick in growth rates in North America which is encouraging. We\u2019re talking share fairly modest and as I have said in other calls, this is tended to be choppy in the past so it\u2019s up one quarter down the next, we\u2019ll see, but that\u2019s a reason to have a degree of hope there. And in terms of where we\u2019re gaining and losing share, generally we\u2019re doing we\u2019re about flat in North America, we\u2019re up a little bit in Europe, we\u2019re down a little bit in a couple of the developing markets and that gets you back to even.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","This goes to both Olay and the Baby Care business and you had mentioned you\u2019re looking how to improve your selling execution in the face of new channel development, so in China in particular the explosion of online sales and mummy stores, beauty shops just could you dive into a little deeper how much that has disrupted the business in China, in particular if I look at Baby I think you had flat volume in the quarter and yet you did very well in the U.S. in Baby, so that would be helpful? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","First of all those the channels that you mentioned are very relevant channels and they\u2019re growing very quickly and we have as you can imagine deliberate efforts to participate in that growth. Also e-commerce is growing very-very quickly in China it\u2019s about 40% of the growth in the market and we\u2019re very well represented there as well. In terms of the difference between Baby share development in the U.S. and China, first of all we remain by a wide margin the market leader in Baby Care in China. The competitive sets are different between China and the U.S. and as a result, you would expect some different dynamics. But we continue to be very encouraged about the business in both areas and that\u2019s really what I have to say.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford Bernstein","So I wanted to get a better understanding of where you think you are versus plan in the turnaround the day you came back. And I think about it along the three dimensions at least one is productivity and I guess I am reacting a little bit to about a fifth of your productivity coming from advertising spend, basis point basis adverting spend this quarter, so one is advertising spend? Two is the pace of divestitures of Duracell happening here very shortly after you said you\u2019re going to do something should we expect as fast or a fast pace for larger divestures like this? And then third is something folks have referred to little bit which is two of your five segments are really driving your growth, now I want to understand within that how much of that is kind of less sensitivity of those particular segments to the macro environment and how of that is actually execution actually innovation actually things you are doing? And so that\u2019s the core question, I just have two follow-up clarity questions on some other things, one is what would your growth have been in beauty without the volumes in Prestige being an issue and what would have your growth have been without Duracell in the Battery segment? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","In terms of where we are, in innings if you will in the execution of the plan, I think we\u2019re in some of the early innings. I think there is a significant. I know that there is a significant productivity opportunity that still stands in front of us. We\u2019ve talked about the redesign of the supply chains. We\u2019ve talked about the portfolio focus which will give us more opportunity to get even more efficient in our overhead approach. So I think there is -- we will accelerate and we\u2019ll exceed the 10 billion and we won\u2019t stop there. I\u2019d see this being characteristic of our opportunities and environment that we\u2019re operating in for the foreseeable future.","In terms of the advertising question within that we have tried to say many times, most of the reduction that\u2019s occurring is in non-media spending. And of the 50 basis points that we referenced in our prepared remarks, 40 basis points of that was non-advertising marketing spending. So it\u2019s lower product cost, it\u2019s lower talent cost, it\u2019s more efficient operation, it\u2019s not less advertising and reaching consumers or in any way less effective advertising in reaching consumers. Our objective here is to continue to strengthen the impact of our marketing and advertising efforts while reducing cost that don\u2019t matter to consumers.","In terms of the pace of divestitures as we said as AG said in the call last quarter and as I mentioned today, we will do this over an 18 to 24 month period. Quite frankly we are not going to be time-driven we are going to be value-driven. And so it\u2019s hard for me to sit here today and say exactly how long it will take. But we will continue to pursue that at pace. We\u2019d obviously like to get there as soon as it\u2019s practical, but don\u2019t want to compromise value by focusing overly on timing versus quality of execution. And honestly relative to the last part of the question, I think it\u2019s very hard to look at one quarters of results and come to a big conclusion about what\u2019s driving anything. So I would encourage us to kind of take those segment results over a period of three or four quarters to get a better feel for what\u2019s going on.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference.

Organic sales growth in the U.S. progressed from 1% in the first half of last fiscal year to 2% in the second half to 3% in the quarter we just completed; growth in China minus 8% to minus 2% to plus 2% over those same time periods.","We've been making sequential progress in each of our largest categories: Baby Care minus 2%, flat, to plus 2%; Grooming plus 2% to plus 3% to plus 3%; Fabric Care plus 1%, plus 1% to plus 5%; and Hair Care minus 1% to flat to plus 2%.","Since last September, organic sales grew in each reporting segment and in all ten product categories. Still, as I said before, work and opportunity remain. Hair Care and Baby Care, two of our largest categories, were both up 2% but below the rates of market growth in these categories. These businesses along with the Grooming business in the U.S. represent notable opportunities for further top line acceleration.","Organic sales grew in each region and in 9 of the 10 largest markets. Here too opportunities remain. Sales in the UK, which continues to be a very challenging, highly promotional market, were down 2%. Organic sales in China and Russia were both up 2%, but again below the pace of market growth; so in summary, progress with more work to do.","Sales growth in the quarter was volume-driven. Organic volume was up 3%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral to our organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were in line with the prior year, including the 3-point headwind from foreign exchange.","As we move forward, progress will not come in a straight line. There will be quarter-to-quarter volatility. Comps will get more difficult. We need to manage significant geopolitical and economic volatility in markets like Egypt, Nigeria, Argentina, even the Philippines. And of course, our competition is not standing still. We still have work remaining in some categories and markets to get our brands back to market levels of growth. These opportunities need to be addressed category by category, market by market, channel by channel. We're after it, but it won't happen overnight.","Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.03, up 5% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange had a negative 7-point headwind on the first quarter earnings. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share were up 12%. Core gross margin increased 50 basis points versus the prior year. On a constant currency basis, core gross margin was up 130 basis points, including 190 basis points of productivity improvement.","Commodities were a modest hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Feedstock costs for propylene, ethylene, and tropical oils are up as much as mid-teens since we set our initial budgets for the year. Wage inflation is also an increasing challenge in many developing markets.","Productivity improvements contributed 270 basis points of operating margin benefit. We reinvested a significant portion of those savings in product and packaging innovation, media reach and continuity, sampling, R&D, sales coverage, and targeted consumer value adjustments in order to accelerate our top line growth. Core operating margin as a result was up 20 basis points for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 120 basis points.","The core effective tax rate was 23%, about a point below last year's first quarter level. This includes the adoption of new accounting standards for share-based compensation, which reduced the quarterly tax rate by about 3 points, about $0.04 per share of benefit to core earnings per share. The impact on the balance of the quarter this fiscal year from this accounting change is expected to be minimal. The fiscal year impact of this change was assumed in our initial guidance for the year.","All-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.96 for the quarter, also up 5% versus the prior year. We generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow with 85% free cash flow productivity; returning $2.9 billion to shareowners, $1.9 billion in dividends, and $1 billion in share repurchase. Our share repurchase flexibility was limited in the first quarter due to trading restrictions related to the Coty transaction.","The day after the quarter ended, on October 1, we reached a very important milestone in our portfolio transformation program, closing the Beauty transaction with Coty. This marks the completion of the most significant portfolio transformation in P&G's history. We have created value for shareowners every step of the way, including over $4 billion versus our keep price in the Beauty deal.","While we will be supporting transition efforts for some time, we can now begin focusing our efforts on the 10 core categories we identified two years ago. The market in each of these 10 core categories is large and is growing between 1% and 7% per year. These are structurally attractive categories where P&G holds leading market positions. Our businesses in these categories have historically grown sales a point faster than the company and held margins that are 2 points higher than the company average. They leverage P&G core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding, and go-to-market, and benefit from the company's scale. Consumers use these categories on a frequent basis, typically daily. Purchase choice is driven more by product performance against a clear consumer need or job to be done than by self-expression or fashion trends. These categories lend themselves to innovation, which creates noticeable superiority.","We'll compete within these categories from the top of the market, building down across middle price tiers that are profitable and growing. We will not compete in the lowest price tiers, which are generally commoditized and where no money is made. We will, however, serve cash constrained consumers with smaller, more affordable pack sizes, requiring less cash outlay per purchase. We're in the midst, as you know, of exiting unprofitable commoditizing price tiers, forms, and segments, enabling us to focus our resources on forms and segments that are profitable and growing.","Our objective for the new 10-category company is very clear, balanced top and bottom line growth that delivers total shareholder return that places P&G consistently in the top third of our peer group.","I spoke earlier about the reacceleration of our top line, and we're going to spend more time on this on Analyst Day. This is critically important. But productivity improvement and cost savings are also a necessity in achieving our TSR objective. They provide fuel for investment and innovation, advertising, sales coverage, trial, and sampling to grow our brands and grow our categories and build margin. Top and bottom line growth are not separate endeavors. They reinforce and fuel each other. They're part of the same ecosystem. They live together and depend on each other. They can't be separated.","Last fiscal year we completed our first 5-year productivity improvement program, accelerating and exceeding each of our cost savings and enrollment reduction objectives. We saved over $7 billion in cost of goods sold. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 22% over the last four years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment was down 27% through last fiscal, with additional progress planned this year. We reduced the number of manufacturing platforms we produce with by 30% over this same period.","Over the last five years, we've reduced non-manufacturing roles by nearly 25%. This excludes the impact of divestitures. Including divestitures, we've reduced overhead roles by about 35%.","As we've decreased the size of the organization, we've also simplified it. We've gone from managing the global business through 50 market cluster organizations to just 25. We've simplified our network of suppliers, reducing, for example, commercial agency support from 6,000 vendors to about half of that. Including reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media, and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating margin improvement and high single to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last four fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency, in fiscal 2016. And we continued the trend in Q1, with double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth and triple-digit constant currency margin expansion.","We're driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down about 10 days over the last five years. Payables days are up more than 30 days, enabled significantly by our supply chain financing program. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next five years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, in sales coverage, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth, which brings me to fiscal year guidance.","We're maintaining our organic sales and core earnings per share outlook for this fiscal year. The first quarter was a good start, but comps get more difficult and we continue to face a relatively slow growth volatile world. We're expecting organic sales growth of around 2% for the year. This includes between 0.5 point and a point of headwind from the portfolio rationalization and strengthening work within the ongoing 10 product categories. It also includes a headwind from lost sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth of about 1%, including around a 1-point drag on growth from the net impact of foreign exchange and divestitures.","Our bottom line guidance for core earnings per share growth is for core earnings per share growth of mid-single digits. This range reflects the volatility of the markets in which we compete, and it reflects the investments we tend to make in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, long-term, market constructive, and value-accretive way.","We continue to forecast a reduction in core non-operating income in fiscal 2017 due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. The core effective tax rate should be roughly in line with the fiscal 2016 level.","All-in GAAP earnings per share should increase 45% to 50%, including the significant one-time gain from the Beauty transaction with Coty that will be recognized in the October \u2013 December results. Also included in GAAP earnings per share are approximately $0.10 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.13 per share of charges related to early debt retirement that we initiated earlier this month.","At current rates and prices, FX and commodities combined are about a $0.12 per share headwind to fiscal 2017 earnings. Significant currency weakness, commodity costs increases, or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range.","We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. Fiscal 2017 will be a year of significant value returned to shareowners. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty, and we expect to make over $5 billion of direct share repurchase; in total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchases this fiscal year.","We look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day here in Cincinnati on November 17 and 18. David Taylor will lead this session. We'll have nearly all of our top leadership team available to meet with you on the evening of November 17, with many of them discussing their businesses during the management presentation on November 18 along with David Taylor and myself. If you can't make it to Cincinnati, we hope you join the webcast of the presentation on the morning of November 18.","That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. I'd be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Jon. Good morning.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","So clearly a good start to the year, and as you say, a fairly straightforward quarter, all things considered. But now we look forward, and I guess my question -really, the question I've been fielding for the last hour or so, is where do we go from here?","I know you don't want to give quarterly guidance and I don't expect you to, but just given how significantly the year-over-year comps ramp in Q2 and really how significantly the volume comps ramp all the way through Q4, I was hoping you could just help frame for us your expectations for the OND (15:07) quarter, and really the cadence of organic growth over the balance of the year, fully appreciating your not in a straight line comments. Because the optimist in me wants to believe that we'll start to see incremental returns on all of this investment you've been making in the last nine months. But then the pessimist in me says, this Q1 momentum may be short-lived as Q2 rears its head.","So again, I know it's tough to call quarters, especially in this environment, but maybe just a little more context around how you're measuring returns on the investments you've made so far, where you're seeing the biggest bang for the buck, and again, how you're thinking about top line progression over the balance of the year. Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Steve. I think you said several important things \u2013 or repeated several important things. One is, not a straight line. Two is, increasingly difficult comps. Obviously, we start the year with a 3% and provide guidance for the year at 2%. There will be a quarter or some quarters below 3%. We've also said that we want to exit the fiscal year closer to the rate of market growth in our categories, setting ourselves up for a strong subsequent year, and so that backs you in to the next two quarters being the more challenging ones in front of us. And that's really as far as I want to go in terms of specific guidance.","In terms of return on the investments we're making, I think you see that, both from a top line and a bottom line standpoint in the first quarter. On a constant currency basis, very significant returns, with 12% core earnings per share growth on 3% top line. We are reinvesting, as we said we would, productivity savings. But as we also have said we would, we're going to continue to modestly improve margins. And that is the only recipe for sustained success in this industry, and we're intent on following it and so far are pleased with the results.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, everyone. Jon, maybe you can help us, following up on Steve's question, just the cadence of the reinvestment or the investment both from a marketing and an innovation perspective. Just trying to understand which quarters are going to be heavy in terms of those investments and new product launches.","And then just a quick follow-up, bigger picture, Kathy [Fish] took over the R&D function a couple years ago. And usually when you have leadership changes in R&D, it takes a couple of years to fill the pipeline. So I just wanted to get your assessment on what the upstream and the current pipeline looks like in terms of, on a scale of 1 to 10, how you would view it in terms of the immediacy of the new products actually hitting the marketplace.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Nik. I apologize in part for my first part of this response, but I really think on a daily basis in terms of fiscal years, not quarters, as you know. And so I really don't even know from a marketing spending exactly what the breakdown or the plan is by quarter. But I know that over the year, we're going to continue to reinvest productivity savings. Those will be more significant as the year progresses. We've also said we want to increase our continuity of marketing spend and trial and sampling building programs, so I expect that statement to lead to relatively constant levels of increase across the quarter. But it's honestly a figure by quarter I don't have currently in my head.","The second part of your question about the cadence of new product introductions, we have significant programs coming to market in the third quarter and another batch towards the end of the fourth quarter. In terms of new product launches, the second quarter will be relatively light. And honestly, I've forgotten the last part of your question, but feel free to call me later today and I can catch you up on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Jon, I was just struck by","toward the end of the call you really emphasized some words like market constructive and value-accretive way of reinvesting. So I was just curious about thoughts and actions in terms of consumer value adjustments as you addressed in the press release and in general the status of your relative pricing in some of your major categories and markets, so 2x4 would be great.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Lauren. I'm glad you picked up on that because this is important. In the new 10-category company where we have leading positions across those categories, we become increasingly dependent on moving markets, on growing markets. There are category\/country combinations where we have 60, 70, 80, 90% market shares, so one more point of share isn't the margin of victory or defeat. And that doesn't mean that share isn't important. Share is important. But we need to be growing markets, increasing the number of users for our brands, and that's what our activity system is all set up to do.","So when you talk about, for example, increasing trial and sampling at point of market entry and point of market change with noticeably superior products, that moves markets over time. And being able to price behind superior innovation also moves markets over time. What doesn't move markets is, for example, leading the march down on promotion spending. If you look at the quarter we just completed, price inclusive of promotion was a neutral contributor to the top line. It has been a neutral to positive contributor to the top line for the last 24 quarters. It has been a positive contributor for many years, I think it's 12 in a row. So that's going to continue to be what we're going to emphasize, which is market accretive, market constructive, growth-driving investments.","Now having said that, we won't be successful in that endeavor and maintain our shares if we're uncompetitive. And so we will take moves where warranted to ensure that we're offering a competitive value proposition to consumers. We've made several of those moves in the last quarter. What moves happen in the future will be largely dependent on where others take us. But thanks for picking up on that point; it's an important one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. So I want to build on that because despite the language of market accretive and market constructive, your last two quarters have clearly shown a shift towards volume growth versus price\/mix. I guess a long-term trajectory, but a long-term trajectory from a top line perspective hasn't been that great. But just now it's starting to look a little bit better, again, volume being the driver. So how do you think about the balance of investments between innovation and ad spend, sampling, and versus less than pure pricing on the top line?","Because the perception we're hearing and you heard one of your competitors yesterday say it effectively. The perception you're hearing from them and some of your other competitors is that it is just starting another price war. We've heard this from P&G before. It's going to be a pyrrhic victory or at least a fleeting victory for now. So how do you get comfortable that that's not going to be the case? You can't really control the perceptions of competitors, obviously. But the perception is already clearly forming. So how are you sure that it's not going to be a pyrrhic or fleeting victory for you guys, and how do you think about the competitors' reaction to you guys clearly being a little bit more aggressive and pushing more volume?","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Ali. We do expect \u2013 we compete in a very strong industry with strong competitors, and we expect them to be working just as hard as we are to protect and build their businesses. And that's one of the factors that I cited in terms of guiding to 2% top line growth on the year against the backdrop of a 3% Q1.","In terms of ensuring that we're engaged in the activities that best support our brands and businesses, there's really not an aggregate answer to that, though I'm comfortable in aggregate. That's really a choice that's made at individual categories and countries. And the way I think about this very simplistically is in line with your question. If we grow business by, for example, significantly increasing promotion spending, that will be \u2013 I think you're absolutely right \u2013 a pyrrhic victory. Why, two reasons; number one, nothing proprietary can be matched instantly. That's very different than a successful investment in innovation or equity building or sampling which can create unique advantage. Two, promotion spending by definition, almost by definition, is market dilutive, whereas those other activity streams can be, if executed with excellence, market accretive, and that's just a better place for us to be in.","So I'm not going to give a formula or an algorithm, not because I'm afraid of giving one, but simply because it doesn't exist at an aggregate level. That's not how we manage the company. But the emphasis points will continue to be focused on long-term drivers of market growth and brand growth, long-term drivers of new users to our brands, but short-term competitiveness.","Operator","Your next question will come from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Jon. Good morning. I'm going to try to sneak in two questions in one. So the first is, why do you think organic growth grew almost \u2013 actually more than 3 points faster? That would have implied by some of the tracked channel data. And so maybe is there a difference between shipments and consumption?","And then on the gross margin side, it seems like most of the currency transaction pain, it probably peaked this quarter and is over. So how do you think about that trajectory and how much of that money has to be reinvested back in the business?","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Bill. First of all, from a comparison of reported results to tracked channel trends, reported tracked channel trends, there are two big drivers within that. One of them is simply the amount of business and the relative growth of that business that's moving online versus offline and to non-tracked customers like Costco, as an example. So in the U.S., for example, that explains about a point of difference, a full point of difference between the tracked channel sales growth numbers and our reported sales growth numbers. In China, that number represents a 5-point reconciliation item between those two numbers, so that's becoming increasingly significant. And as you know, the relative growth rates there are very, very different, 30% in one to call it 3% \u2013 2% in the other.","The other difference that exists in the U.S. tracked channel reports, as it should, is the inclusion of the Beauty businesses that were transitioned to Coty as of October 1. So any of the share reports or sales growth reports that have come out to date rightly include that business. They won't going forward. And that dynamic in the U.S. explains about 0.5 point of difference between the tracked channel numbers and the core non-discontinued business numbers that we're reporting today. And that's about \u2013 that's another big part of the equation.","We do have one situation which I'll make you aware of that falls into your last bucket, which is timing differences that would affect the different quarterly reporting numbers, and that's in China where we transitioned our Hong Kong business to a new distributor. And so there's some pipeline fill to that distributor in the numbers on the quarter, call it 1 to 2 points, relatively small on a total company basis, but that's a 1 to 2-point impact in China itself. So those are the primary drivers of the differences.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of William Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Good morning, Bill.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, Jon. One thing you said in the prepared remarks is talking about Hair Care and Grooming as opportunities for growth, and I just wanted to drill into that. And are they really \u2013 what we've seen, especially in Grooming, over the years, ups and downs, and you're the dominant player in the category. Is that something that you can get back to reasonable growth? And as you look across all the categories, do you think now with Beauty out, all of them can grow in line with expectations, or are there some that will be laggards over time?","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","If you just look at the last two quarters on a global basis for Grooming, we grew organic sales 3% in the quarter that we just completed, and the prior quarter we grew 3% as well. We continue to have significant opportunities on the Grooming business for growth. Certainly, the developing market opportunity is very significant. But there are opportunities as we increase our relevance from a channel standpoint, as we increase our relevance from an opening price point standpoint, as we increase innovation across each of the tiers of the business, whether that's disposables, mid-price systems like MACH3, or at the high end. So I do see that as a market that offers growth opportunities to us. And I feel that way about every business within the portfolio, especially relative to the metric of market growth.","The market growths are different across the categories. I mentioned in the prepared remarks they range anywhere from 1% to 7%, and so I would expect our businesses to grow at slightly different rates. And obviously the geographic opportunity is different by market. But in general, we settled on this portfolio because it's one we feel we can grow and can do so profitably.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Good morning, Dara.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Jon, you articulated that there's room for efficiency in your $18 billion promotional budget previously. That's obviously a very large bucket. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit more granularity on if your efforts in that area are supposed to yield actual savings that are substantial that you can drop to the bottom line over time. Or is your approach more to redistribute any of the potential efficiencies back to drive more effective spending and hopefully higher top line growth over time? And then also, when do you expect the promotional efficiencies to really ramp up and take hold from a timing standpoint? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","The idea here is to increase both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our spend across the elements of the marketing mix. And there are many cases where promotion spending is a very effective use of our funds, and we'll continue to support that spend.","There are other instances where both we and our retail partners would be better off redirecting that spending to other elements of the marketing mix, focusing back again on how can we drive market growth in our categories and how can we drive shopping trips and basket size for our retail partners. And it's really working together in a joint context to identify where those opportunities are, where today we're potentially both engaging in activities that are both market and profit dilutive to both sides of the partnership, and looking for ways to redirect those funds in a way that can be more accretive to both sides of the partnership. I do not see this as being a significant source of bottom line help. I think we're much more in the camp of redirecting and redistributing to encourage market growth, growth in users, and have that happen in a profitable way for both partners.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thanks. Good morning, Jon. Do you guys have any data to suggest you're attracting new consumers with all the sampling that you're doing, and how does that compare to your expectations? Are these consumers younger? Are they shopping more online versus brick-and-mortar, or are they fairly similar to your traditional consumer? And then just also, I'm not sure I heard it. But can you provide the price\/mix volume breakdown between developed markets and emerging markets? Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Sure. So I'm just looking for data here. If I look at volume sales price mix in developed, volume is plus 4%, sales plus 2%, price\/mix minus 2%, for a net of plus 2%. That's obviously the all-in number, but organic volume plus 4%, sales plus 2%. In developing, organic volume plus 3%, sales plus 6%, and then \u2013 those are the major drivers of what's happening there.","In terms of payout on sampling, I'm glad you asked that question. This is something that is typically \u2013 if you can sample consumers at point of market entry or point of market change with noticeably superior products in categories where brand loyalty is relatively higher, the lifetime benefit from that relatively modest investment can be significant, but it is a lifetime benefit. A consumer will take a period of time just to use the product that you've sampled them with. And so that's not an investment endeavor that we typically see immediate returns in. That's why, unfortunately, we got into a practice of reducing that spending because it wasn't producing \u2013 it never produces immediate short-term result. But it's really the area of spending that should be the last that we cut because of its importance in building users for potentially a lifetime of consumption. So we're happy with our efforts to date, but it's an area of return that we'll be monitoring and measuring for several years to come.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. Just to clarify, I think you called out another 1-point headwind on volumes this quarter from SKU reductions and minor brand divestitures and all that. Is that a number that's going to be in perpetuity, or do you have a time certain in mind that that headwind is going to end?","And then secondly, if I'm looking at the Beauty business, and granted the 2% number is much better than we've seen, so that's great. But with Pantene up mid-single digits, and I know SK-II up strongly, I think that that implies that Olay is still really struggling. And maybe that's related to the first question, which is the SKU reductions that I know you've taken there. But what is the timeframe, do you think, for when Olay will return to growth mode? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","In terms of the drag on the top line from portfolio focusing within the 10 categories, that is something that should start ramping down in the back half of this fiscal year. I expect it to continue, though, at some level through probably the first quarter, first two quarters of next fiscal year. But I don't think it's at a level during that period when we're likely to be talking about it; so still significant through the second quarter, reducing in significance sequentially from there.","In terms of the Beauty business, we're very happy with how that's performing overall, as you said, plus 2%. I mentioned the sequential Hair Care acceleration that's occurred over the last 18 months or so. In the quarter, as you mentioned, Pantene was up mid-single digits. Head & Shoulders was up mid-single digits. SK-II was up strong double digits. Our Personal Care business is doing fairly well. Olay is stabilizing. We're going to annualize coming up here in the not too distant future the SKU cuts that we made in the U.S. We should annualize those in the back half. And we're just in the middle of redoing our entire counter system in China, and that includes some reductions in the number of counters to be more relevant in the channels that we want consumers shopping for Olay in and to have a better overall shopping and consumer experience. So I expect that those two items, the SKU reduction in the U.S. and the counter rationalization or redesign in China, will continue to put some pressure on Olay, call it through the balance of the fiscal.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. Jon, you mentioned market growth range here from 1% to 7%, and hopes that you close the gap, tracking close to market growth by the end of the year. Can you give us a sense of what all-in that market growth looks like on a weighted average category\/country basis?","And then separately, even when we back out this 1 to 2-point benefit in China, the sequential improvement is notable, so congratulations on that. I was hoping you could expound a little bit more on the drivers of that improvement, whether it be channel driven, category driven. Just give us a little bit more color.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Jason. In terms of an aggregate market growth number, it's likely somewhere between 3% and 3.5%. I say likely because, as you know, that's a metric that lags, so I don't have data through September, for example. It's been declining modestly quarter to quarter, 6-month period to 6-month period, but I expect we're going to be somewhere in the 3% to 3.5% range overall.","In terms of China, we've made some real progress on a couple important businesses and continue to do reasonably well in some others, with some work in the balance still to do. If we look at Oral Care, for example, in China it was up almost 15% on the quarter. That's driven by continued progress with the Oral-B brush as well as the high-end premium Oral-B paste that we launched a couple quarters ago. Shave Care, to the point of the question is there growth in Grooming, that remains up 17% on the quarter in China. Our Personal Care business is doing extremely well in China, as is SK-II, so that the entire Skin and Personal Care business was up about 10% in the quarter.","Our biggest business in China, as you know, is our Hair Care business, which is a significant portion of the total. We continue to have four of the top leading brands in the market in Head & Shoulders, Rejoice, Pantene, and Vidal Sassoon. I think those are respectively number one, two, four, and five in the market. We're essentially flat there versus year ago, so we do have some \u2013 and part of that is driven by some new entrants into the market. One thing, but clearly it continues to be a strong business and offers some upside.","The one business where we need to make much more progress is on Baby Care, which was down again double digits on the quarter. We feel very good about portions of our portfolio. Our pant offering, for example, is doing extremely well. We have some new premium taped innovation coming into the market in the next six to nine months, which we're also very excited about. But that is a business that we need to keep working on.","In terms of channels in China, we're doing very well in e-commerce, growing ahead of the market, building share in e-commerce, still not yet to the level of our brick-and-mortars shares but improving significantly. We've stabilized and started growing shares in the hyper and super part of the business, which is encouraging. We still have some challenges both in the wholesale market and in building distribution in some of the specialty channels that are among the fastest growing. But as you rightly point out, overall real progress, and as I think about China long term, a significant opportunity on both the top and bottom line for the company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, Jon.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","A quick housekeeping and then a broader question, so the housekeeping question, just because we've gotten a couple inquiries from investors this morning. The organic volume growth number was strong, albeit against a soft comp. Was there any timing benefit in the quarter or anything notable that you'd comment on with respect to retail inventory levels?","And then the broader question, and I apologize if I missed this, what are the market growth assumptions contemplated in your outlook? And maybe you could separate the comments, Jon, into U.S., other developed markets, and then emerging markets. And I ask that in the context, we've seen some of your competitors talk about slowing market growth rates, particularly in Latin America. And maybe you could also comment on whether that outlook or those growth rate assumptions have changed over the past few months. Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","In terms of the organic volume and any timing impacts within that, not really. The biggest driver there is sell-through to consumption as well as the base period dynamic, which you rightly cited. There are certain categories where events are at different times and cross-quarters this year versus last year, but in aggregate that's not a significant driver of the volume progress that occurred.","In terms of the market growth assumptions split developed and developing, this is like foreign exchange or commodities in that I don't know what the future holds. And so our forecast is predicated really on the equivalent of FX or commodity spot rates, which is just simply the latest data. And the latest data we have past three months shows market growth of a little over 1% in developed markets. That's inclusive of Western Europe, Japan, et cetera. And it shows 5% growth in developing markets. Weighted average together you get close to the 3% to 3.5% number that I was speaking with Jason about.","If you look at the trend of those numbers, and I'm looking at sequential three-month periods, I really don't see a significant difference or a significant trend of change across those markets, so 0.1s and 0.2s, but nothing of significance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I just wanted to focus on Fabric Care, if I could, this morning. I guess you guys mentioned in the press release organic sales in developed markets up high single digit. I guess first, how sustainable is that? I assume that number was similar in the U.S. And maybe if you can, compare that to what category growth was in the U.S. And maybe finally an update on competitive activity, particularly from Henkel in U.S. laundry \u2013 or sorry, in U.S. Fabric Care? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","So starting with the aggregate number, as you know, organic sales in Fabric Care grew 5% in July \u2013 September. Within that, North America was up 7%, so we did build share of about 0.4 points on a past three-months basis in North America. The most important thing, though, in North America is the improvement in the rate of market growth, going back to our earlier conversations, up 4 points on a past three-month basis, driven by innovation in the category, which is exactly what we hoped to see. Also, growth within that segment is being fueled by our fabric enhancers business, the U.S. up 7 points versus last year with the scent beads segment, the one we're innovating in the most significantly, growing in the mid-20s; our fabric enhancer share up 1.5 points on a past three-month basis.","We've withstood fairly successfully several competitive dynamics. We don't take that casually, though. But if we can continue to be an innovation leader in the market and moving the market, we believe we'll continue to be in a good position. Will the growth rate stay at that level? I would say likely not to that full extent in developed markets, but they'll continue to be attractive. On the other hand, what's implied deductively in those numbers is declines in developing markets. A lot of that is being driven by the portfolio, focusing efforts within Fabric Care, getting out of some of the lower-priced tiers, the bars, even powders in some markets. And so that's having an impact on growth from a negative standpoint, which should dissipate as we go forward. And so when you put those two things together, I would expect that Fabric Care will continue to be a strong contributor of growth at a total company level.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a couple housekeeping questions. So China category growth, what is it in the markets in which you compete when your competitors are talking about just overall slowdown? I'm just trying to think about whether that's company or category specific. And then from an EPS algorithm standpoint for this year, what's embedded there from an input cost standpoint if you're starting to see things increase a bit there?","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","China market growth, when you look at the \u2013 first of all, it's very different by category, so let me start there. And most of the categories, based on the data that we have, are holding up fairly well. There's been a lot of conversation, for example, about diaper category market value growth. If I look past 12, 6, and 3 months, I see 12.0%, 11.0%, 12.0%. So I don't see a major change in the growth rate of that market, and obviously it's at a very attractive level. If I look at, for example, Feminine Care, again, fairly simple; it's fairly standard growth rates, Fabric Care 4.5%, 4.2%, 4.2%.","Where you do see a significant reduction in the market growth rates in the tracked channel data is in some of the Beauty businesses, but I don't have all the data here in front of me. But that is largely driven by the movement of that business online. It's one of the disproportionate growers on e-commerce in China. And in aggregate, we still see relatively healthy market growth. In total call it 5% to 6% to 7%, without a significant change in that trend over the past 12 months.","In terms of input costs, I said in the prepared remarks that the combination of FX and commodities was a $0.12 headwind to earnings per share. About 2\/3 of that is coming from commodities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.","Caroline Levy - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning, thank you. Looking, I think that the numbers you gave us on developed and developing market growth were volume up 4%, price down 2% in developed; and price up 3%, volume up 3% in developing. The question I would have is, as currencies stabilize, do you think there's less opportunity to get that 3 points of pricing in the developing markets? And so should we be actually a little more cautious on the pricing outlook moving forward?","And then the other thing would be could you just talk about the biggest challenges to market share? I'm assuming it's Olay China and the U.S. and it's a couple of other big things. But if you could, just touch on that.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","I think you're right. To the extent that foreign exchange headwinds diminish, the pricing activity that we'll be engaging in, in developing markets would in all likelihood be lower. At the same time, though, that absence of price increase should lead to stronger volume growth over time. So I wouldn't necessarily look at developing market growth rates as inherently declining. But I think you're absolutely right that the components of that growth should be different. That's relative to price specifically.","Relative to mix, I think you're still going to see some benefit there as major portions of the developing world move up the pricing ladder. The premiumization that we've seen in China, which is the largest developing market, is one example of that. And I expect that will occur in other markets as well as economies stabilize and improve. So net, I still am relatively bullish on our positions in developing markets and the growth prospects that they bring with them.","In terms of market share losses, I mentioned the categories on a global aggregate basis where we're growing behind the market, and one of them is Hair Care. The other is Baby Care. And I also mentioned an opportunity in the U.S. Grooming market. We are on all of those. If you take Hair Care, for example, we're making great progress on Head & Shoulders, up 5 points in the quarter. We're making great progress on Pantene, up 5 points in the quarter. We have some issues, though, with some of our smaller brands, like Herbal Essences, for example, and we have a whole new program and a restage coming to market in the second half of the year.","I mentioned some of the product work we're doing in Baby Care. And when we get that right, we tend to perform very well. If you look at the U.S., for example, where we do have that right, we're building market share both on Pampers and in aggregate. So as I mentioned, there's opportunity to improve. It's not something that will happen overnight, but it's clearly identified and being aggressively focused on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, thanks for the question. So it looks like as of last March, P&G had seen 17 consecutive quarters of negative foreign exchange effect, and it's a record (54:28) going back to 2000, but I don't know about before that. It's pretty extraordinary. In 15 of those 17 quarters, you took pricing, and now we've had two quarters in a row where you haven't, and absorbed a foreign exchange hit. Now that could just be coincidence, or I guess it could be an indication of a new direction broadly. But what I'd ask is first, could we \u2013 following on Caroline's question, can we expect, based on what you know right now, foreign exchange, would pricing be a component of the 2% \u2013 positive pricing be a component of the 2% organic sales target for this year, based on what you know right now?","And when you think about value, as you mentioned in your remarks, can that include probably the highly likely benefits you get from gaining market share right now in developing markets, at a time when foreign currency is almost sure to turn around at some point? Is that included in the value equation when you compensate people when you manage these businesses? Thanks very much.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","There are real differences between, call it the last year and the years prior to that in the FX dynamics, which drive different decisions. You may recall, when we headed into the most recent round of big FX impacts, which was last year, we said that while historically we've been able to regain about 2\/3 of the impact through pricing, we didn't feel we were going to be able to do that this time around. And that was driven in large part simply by a divergence in what was happening to the dollar and what was happening to the functional currencies for some of our significant competitors, namely the euro, the pound, and the yen. And those currencies were weakening over that period of time, and so there was less need for competitors who were reporting results in those currencies to price. And as much as anything, that's what you're seeing being reflected in the actuals.","We're going to be pragmatic. We're going to offer a good value to consumers. But we're also going to work through every means we have available to us, including cost savings and mix improvement innovation to maintain attractive structural economics so that growth is worth something in these markets. And that's a different answer in every category and every market, month to month, week to week. So we're going to try to manage that as intelligently as we can. I wouldn't expect at this point, based on your point on where we sit today, do I expect pricing to be a significant part of the equation the balance of the year? I do not.","In terms of how people are compensated, we are a U.S. dollar functional currency company. We pay dividends in dollars. We repurchase shares in dollars. And our investor base, as you well know, really doesn't care how many rubles we have or pesos we have. What they care about is how many dollars we have. And so the primary compensation lens is through all-in performance on dollar terms. We do, though, also have a look, because we don't want to incent behavior that's too short-term oriented, at constant currency. But over periods of time, we're going to measure our success or failure based on earnings per share and earnings growth and importantly, cash growth in dollars.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks for the question. Hey, Jon, I just wanted to ask a little more broadly about two higher growth potential areas of your business. One is direct-to-consumer, and the second is green or environmentally sound or sustainable, whatever you'd like to call it. Are you happy or satisfied overall with the progress that the company is making here? And I know you have programs like Gillette Shave Club and products like Tide Pure Clean. Is this something that you can accomplish internally, be it internal focus or organic focus, or do you think you need to supplement or look to accelerate it with M&A as well? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Jon. Let me address green and sustainable first. While we're open to both inorganic and organic ways of increasing our product superiority and the sustainability of our products, and that's an important 'and', it hasn't been our experience that there's a lot available on the market that delivers that 'and', which something like Tide Pure Clean definitely delivers. We've been on this for a while. While Tide Pure Clean is new, and is doing very well, if you look at share of the segment, it's done remarkably well in a short period of time. Things like Tide Cold Water, if you look at the entire energy consumption stream involved in washing clothes, there's more consumed in terms of energy to heat water than there is in the process of manufacturing and distributing detergent.","So we're going to continue to look at all vectors that enable us to improve our sustainability across the value chain from a sustainability standpoint to have products that consumers can choose that enable them to improve their impact on the environment while still delivering against the need or the job to be done. So I don't think anything is required from an acquisition standpoint, but I also don't want you to think that we're not very open-minded in our pursuit of this objective, because we are.","As it relates to DTC, this is an area I think that's important that we frame, first of all. Direct-to-consumer sales in our product categories globally currently represent 0.3% of sales. And it's not a reason \u2013 I'm not saying that to indicate that it's not a potentially important tool for us, I believe it is. And we've been going direct-to-consumer. Think about SK-II, as an example, for a period of time. There are opportunities for us to increase our relevance from a selling and brand building standpoint in a direct-to-consumer context across several of our categories, and we're mobilizing against those.","And again, I don't want this to be taken the wrong way, but I don't see a mass move, call it 20% or 30% of the market, to direct-to-consumer consumption. If you just think about the experience of that, how many people do you really know that want to satisfy their household products shopping needs in a month or two by going to 40 different websites with 40 different passwords and 40 different packages that arrive at 40 different times? Again, I'm not in any way denigrating the opportunity that tool presents us and we need to fully capitalize on that, which we're working to do, but I did want to provide just a little bit of context.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

P&G would like to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. Our second quarter results keep us on track with our objectives for fiscal year 2017. Organic sales for the quarter grew 2%. This includes about a 1-point drag from the rationalization of the ongoing portfolio and reduced finished product sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries. It also includes negative impacts from Indian demonetization and difficult operating environments in markets such as Nigeria, Egypt, Turkey and Argentina.","Top line growth was broad-based. Organic sales improved in five of six regions, eleven of the 15 largest markets, all five reporting segments and in nine of ten product categories. In the U.S. our largest market organic sales grew 2%. Over the last three semesters, U.S. organic sales have progressed from up about half a point versus a year ago to up about 1.5 points to up more than 2 points. In China, our second largest market, organic sales growth has also progressed over the last three semesters and down 8% to down 2% to up 2.5% including 3% growth in the most recent quarter.","We\u2019re making similar progress in each of our largest categories. Over the last three semesters, Fabric Care organic sales growth has progressed from up just less than 1% to 1.5% to 3% growth. Hair Care from down 1% to flat to up more than 2%. Baby Care from down more than two points to flat to up about half a point. And Grooming from up point and a half to up over 2 points in the two most recent semesters.","Sales growth in the quarter was volume driven, organic volume was up 2%. Pricing and mix were each essentially neutral to our organic sales growth. All-in sales for the company were flat versus the prior year, including the 2-point headwind from foreign exchange.","Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.08, up 4% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a 5-point headwind on second quarter earnings growth about $0.05 per share worse than we expected heading into the quarter. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share were up 9%. On a year-to-date basis constant currency core earnings per share growth is up double digits, extending the four year streak of high single or double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth. Core gross margin increased 70 basis points. On a constant currency basis, core gross margin was up 120 basis points, including 210 basis points of productivity improvement and a modest benefit from volume growth.","Commodities mix and pricing were each a 30 point hurt to gross margin in the quarter. Core operating margin was inline with the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 60 basis points. Productivity improvements contributed 230 basis points of operating margin benefit. Core effective tax rate was 23.5%, essentially equal to the base period rate. ","All-in GAAP earnings per share were $2.88 for the quarter, up 157% versus the prior year. This includes gain of $1.95 per share from the Beauty transaction with Coty that closed at the beginning of the quarter. We generated $2.4 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We have returned $12.7 billion to shares, $1.8 billion in dividends, $1.5 billion in share repurchase and $9.4 billion in share exchanges with the Beauty transaction. Despite some significant and unforeseen challenges, we stand at the halfway mark of our fiscal year essentially on track with where we hoped we would be.","We are raising our guidance for fiscal year organic sales growth from around 2% to a range of plus 2% to 3% with the fourth quarter expected to be stronger than the third. We now expect fiscal 2017 all-in sales growth to be in line with the prior year. This includes a 2 to 3 point headwind from the combined impacts of foreign exchange and divestitures. We\u2019re maintaining for now our guidance for bottom line core earnings per share growth of mid single-digits.","We continue to deal with an unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty, which is affecting market growth, currency and commodities. We are not immune from these macro dynamics. We are aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate these impacts, but we\u2019re protecting investments in the business to accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable long-term market constructive and value accretive way. Even if it means results end up below the current core earnings per share guidance range.","We continue within our core of earnings per share estimates to reflect a reduction in fourth quarter non-operating income due to lower gains from minor brand divestitures. We now expect the core effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be slightly below last year\u2019s level. All-in GAAP earnings per share are forecast to increase by 48% to 50%, including the one-time gain from the Beauty transaction. At current rates and prices, FX is more than $0.5 billion headwind on fiscal 2017 earnings. Commodities are a $200 million headwind. Combined, they are about a $0.26 per share drag on fiscal 2017 core EPS. We\u2019re working to offset this, but are not yet completely there.","Further significant currency weakness, commodity price increases, or additional geopolitical disruption are not anticipated within this guidance range. We expect adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or better. As you know, fiscal 2017 is a year of significant value return to share owners. We expect to pay dividends of over $7 billion. We reduced outstanding shares by $9.4 billion in the transaction with Coty and we expect to purchase over $5 billion of our stock. In total, about $22 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchase this year.","As David said, again at our Analyst Day, our objective is sustainably balanced growth and value creation. We discussed our focus areas in depth in our Analyst Day presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website, so I won\u2019t elaborate on these again today. Instead I thought the balance of our time this morning could be most productively spent providing perspective on the most frequent conversation topics and questions we have been engaging with you on at and since the Analyst Day meeting.","Top-line progress and prospects, retail trade transformation, naturals products and sustainability, cost structure progress and prospects, portfolio, foreign exchange impacts, and our management approach to them, capital structure and debt and the bundle of trade and tariffs and tax reform. I will take each of these one by one and then I will turn it over to you for additional questions.","First how do we view our topline progress and longer term prospects. We stand modestly ahead of plan. We grew organic sales about a half point faster in each of the first two quarters than we were forecasting going in. We\u2019re making sequential progress and most of our top categories in markets and we\u2019re doing this despite some significant unexpected challenges. India demonetization, the elimination of 500, 1000 Rupee bank notes that accounted for over 80% of that country\u2019s currency in a cash dominated economy was an unexpected headwind.","It was flowing high single-digits growth last quarter to a decline of high singles this quarter. Economic crises in Egypt and Nigeria are dramatically impacting category size; market contractions in Russia, Argentina, and Turkey pose real challenges and we\u2019ve had to manage the market impacts of politically-related currency devaluation in places like the UK and Mexico. Our organic topline for the first half of the year has been affected by the portfolio work we\u2019re doing in the ten ongoing categories and by loss sales to our Venezuelan subsidiaries.","With all these challenges, we grew organic sales between 2% and 3% for the first half, putting us, as I said, modestly ahead of plan. This is very encouraging as our many elements looking forward. We\u2019re now a more focused ten category company, where purchase and intent in choice are driven by a specific job to be done and our products\u2019 effectiveness in doing it. These are predominantly daily use categories that matter to our retail partners.","We said the new portfolio would grow up to a point faster and over the first two quarters of this fiscal year we\u2019re seeing that play out. We are increasing our investments in market-stimulating product innovation. We\u2019re continuing to improve and expand unit dose detergents. This premium price form has already past $2 billion in retail sales. We're currently building on this line-up, launching Tide PODS Plus Downy in North America.","Our scent bead offerings including Downy Unstopables, Lenor, Gain Fireworks and Bounce are growing fast and are growing the fabric enhancer category. In the US, Downy Beads are growing in the mid-20%s and the category is up 7 points. ","In Germany, where we launched Lenor Beads last summer, the fabric enhancer category is up 6% and our share is now over 50%. Our scent beads are available in 33 countries so far, including the recent launch in the Arabian Peninsula. ","Always Discreet has increased market growth rates for female adult incontinence products by roughly 50% in the eight countries that we've launched so far. Last fall, we launched our new Pampers Easy Ups Training pants in US. Since the launch, segment growth is 16% and Pampers' share has increased by over 4 points. ","We are strengthening investments and brand awareness and trial at the point of market entry and point of market change. 70% of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best Pampers product through our prenatal and hospital programs. ","Gillette will sample over 2 million FlexBall ProShield razors with young men on their 18th birthdays. We will distribute over 30 million laundry detergent samples in new washing machines this fiscal year. We were connecting always with girls when they most need reassurance and self-confidence as they enter puberty and become new Feminine Care consumers.","We're making organization changes to improve our execution, speed and responsiveness to local market dynamics. We are increasing our investment in sales resources to improve coverage of fast-growing channels, including eCommerce and specialty stores. We're adding salespeople with deep category experiences in categories like personal health care. And we're changing our talent development and career planning approach to build and reward applied category mastery. ","In our larger markets, we are establishing direct end-to-end lines from each product categories straight through to our retail customer teams. In smaller countries that we manage as market clusters, we're implementing changes to give on the ground business leaders more flexibility to react quickly to competitive threats or customer opportunities. ","We see a significant cost and cash productivity runway ahead of us, enabling us to keep funding smart market accretive growth opportunities. While we're not without our topline challenges, we're currently tracking ahead of plan and are raising our outlook for the year.","So our next topic, you've been asking about is retail trade transformation and the impacts and opportunities for P&G. Our largest opportunity across channels of trade lies in creating and building indispensable brands and products of superior value, and in providing go-to-market experiences that are relevant and valuable to shoppers wherever they choose to shop. ","If we do this well, we should have opportunity across channels and classes of trade. We don't currently envision and\/or retail world, online or offline, mobile or desktop, subscription or a-la-carte. The mix along each of these continuums will vary by category, by country, by consumer and by occasion. We need to be relevant across this mix. One measure of relevance is market share. Our results vary by category and country, but on an aggregate basis, our online shares are currently equal to offline. ","P& G eCommerce sales are now $3 billion. I was with David and the team last week in China. While we have more work to do, our eCommerce business there will reach 20% of sales and will exceed $1 billion this year. With an aggregate eCommerce share larger than the next three largest competitors in our categories combined. ","In Korea, eCommerce is now 40% of our business. We're building a full toolkit of capabilities we can put to work where relevant. For diapers, subscription can provide convenience and increase loyalty. For SK-II super premium skin care, direct-to-consumer counseling either in-store or online can help inform the benefits of regimen usage.","We're prototyping supply-chain capabilities to produce and deliver features at equal cost per unit to current batch production. We're positioning ourselves for relevance across channels and shopping preferences. We remain fully committed to our omni-channel retail partners and shoppers where most of the business remains and where we also see significant growth opportunities.","Stores continue to hold strong relevance for many shoppers. For many shoppers, stores are more convenient, stopping at one location for multiple items. No packages left at the door; no passwords to manage. They can be more efficient for many shoppers groceries, gas, banking, and pharmacy, all in one stop.","Stores can be cheaper, with no membership fees, or delivery charges and for some consumers, stores offer a social experience away from home or a break from out behind their desks. The important points are that we continue to create and build indispensable brands and products whose relevance extends across channels and are building the skills, capabilities and partnerships to win where average consumers choose to shop.","The next question. Is there an opportunity for P&G to better serve the naturals consumer and the increasingly environmentally concerned shopper? There absolutely is. We introduced the first bio-based detergent with the cleaning power of Tide with Tide Pure Clean this past year.","Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients and is produced with a 100% renewable wind power electricity, in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill. While it's still early days, Pure Clean holds a 7% share of the pure and naturals segment and is driving over a 150% of the naturals segment growth.","We're just launching Herbal Essences with bio:renew, a revolutionary blend of antioxidants, aloe, and sea kelp that delivers an amazing product experience. The launch includes nine new collections, including styling products free of parabens, dyes, and gluten and an alcohol-free hair spray.","We are launching new Febreze Air Effects that introduces a proprietary odor-fighting technology, delivered in a plastic can versus the previous aluminum packaging. The plastic can reduces the carbon footprint by 11% and results in a more efficient manufacturing process, using 15% less energy and reducing waste by 10%.","On Charmin, we've added Forest Stewardship Council labels to let consumers know that 100% of our pulp is sourced from environmentally responsible forests.","P&G is a sustainability leader in laundry and home care industry. We're the first multinational company to globally remove phosphates from all laundry and auto-dishwashing detergents without a compromise in cleaning.","We're the first multinational company with 98% of this liquid laundry detergent compacted globally, with a dosage recommendation of 75 milligrams or lower. We're on track to reach 100% compaction in the near future. We believe one of the largest impacts we can make is enabling and educating consumers to use energy efficient laundry wash cycles.","We\u2019ve set a target to have 70% of all machine wash loads completed in energy efficient wash cycles by 2020. We hope to get there with innovations like Tide HE Turbo Clean specifically designed for great performance in high-efficiency machines.","Moving behind the scenes, our supply network transformation enables improvements in environmental sustainability as we move manufacturing and distribution closer to consumption. Since 2010, we\u2019ve reduced truck transportation commerce by more than 25%.","Over the same time period, our plant size have reduced water use by 24% and increased our renewable energy use to 10% with a goal of 30% in the next four years. As we\u2019ve reported on our first-ever Citizenship Report published in December, we've recently achieved our 2020 goal of reducing energy use at P&G facilities by 20%, four years ahead of schedule.","Recently, we set a goal for zero manufacturing waste to landfill from all production sites by 2020. These natural ingredient-based products and our industry-leading efforts to improve the environmental sustainability of our operations enable us to increase the relevance of our brands and products with the naturals consumer and the increasingly environmentally conscious shopper.","Next, how are you feeling about your cost structure as it stands today and going forward? We feel very good about our current cost structure, having made significant progress over the past several years. And we have significant savings opportunities in front of us, which should enable us to invest in smart market-constructive financially accretive growth. We've talked about the historical progress before. We set a goal to save $10 billion over five years and then accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives over that period.","We reduced manufacturing enrollment on a same-site basis by 27 and on an all-in basis, including divestitures by 35%. We reduced overhead enrollment by nearly 25%, excluding divestitures and by about 35%, including divestitures. Net of re-investments and to innovation, sales coverage, media and sampling, productivity savings have enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating profit margin improvement at high single-digit to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last four fiscal years.","Over that same time period, constant currency earnings in our developing market grew 6 times faster than organic sales, significantly expanding local currency profit margins. On the balance sheet, we've improved inventory by around 10 days and payables by more than 30 days over the last five years. Our aggregate 22% core operating profit margin is the third highest in our industry. Only two companies in our primary competitive peer group have higher margins, Reckitt and Colgate, largely due to categories they compete in. Over the last three fiscal years, we've grown our top quintile operating margin by more than two points. What matters more than aggregate margin is the competitive comparison within each category. P&G's category gross margins are higher than competition by an average of about five points up to as many as 14 points.","The comparison favors P&G in over three-quarters of the cases. Over the last four years, we've grown our aggregate gross margin by two points. We see similar advantages in core SG&A overhead. When we compare P&G's SG&A overhead costs to a competitive average, weighted by P&G's business mix by sector, our costs are more than 100 basis points lower than the competitive weighted average. Over last four years we\u2019ve reduced P&G's overhead costs, as a percentage of sales, by 50 basis points; over the next five years, we expect further improvement.","Putting this together, at the operating margin level, P&G's operating margins are higher than competition or more than 70% of the category level comparisons. We have double-digit advantages in several and a notable gap in just one. We have further advantages in below-the-line costs. We borrow at some of the most favorable rates in our industry and have a tax rate that is among the industry's lowest.","We are in an advantaged position but there is significant opportunity remaining to increase structural cost advantages and further improve cash efficiencies. We discussed many of these opportunities at our Analyst Day meeting, including the transformation of our supply chain and the digitization and automation of more of our work processes, both on and off the manufacturing floor. We will continue to improve productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet, creating fuel to reinvest in smart value-accretive growth.","The next question you've been asking is whether we are confident we will maximize value with the recently restructured Company. We believe we can create superior value with the new company that we've just created. We've been through significant portfolio valuation and reconstruction over the last two years. We've carefully and thoroughly evaluated each of our businesses for strategic merit, fit with our core capabilities, financial attractiveness, and historical track record of return.","As we completed this thorough analysis, we felt several of the categories and more than half the brands have the potential to create more value in the hands of other companies, with stronger, more relevant capabilities in the categories in question, pet food with Mars, fragrances with Coty. We moved these categories out, removed all the stranded overhead and monetized the portion of the incremental value for our share owners.","In the last few years, we've transitioned from a Company that competes in 16 product categories to one that competes in 10, or about 170 brands to 65. The businesses we exited represented about 14% of fiscal 2013 sales and only about 6% of our profit. Our new 10 category portfolio has historically grown 1 point faster and then 2 margin points more profitable than the old portfolio.","So our affirmative response to value creation with the current company is not a function of our unwillingness to change or consider alternatives. The conviction comes from having done exactly that. It has only been one quarter, three months since we completed the majority of the portfolio moves but we're encouraged by path ahead of us.","Another reason value creation is maximized with the new company are the synergies that exists in the new company portfolio, which are greater than the synergies that existed in the old portfolio. A number of the innovation platforms we are advancing have relevant and multiple of the 10 categories. The supply chain we are transforming is designed to synergize this portfolio with multi-category production and mixing centers. Most of the businesses we've divested, batteries, for example, or pet food, were self-contained from a manufacturing standpoint and had different patterns and endpoints of distribution.","The mix of businesses we're moving forward with continues to facilitate highly synergized and cost-effective support functions and maintain scale purchasing advantages. For some businesses we chose to divest, we had a significant number of resources to provide the same level of support, a significant cost to synergy associated with the separation. The cost to synergy that completes separation will be massive. The operational dissynergy is extraordinarily complex. The tax implications will likely be very significant as would capital structure dissynergies, resulting in interest expense.","To overcome these negatives and create more value as separate pieces, we would have to be comfortable believing in dramatically higher topline growth rates, more than just one point or two points over many years. At current rates of market growth, this would imply sustained growth above market rates.","Having said all of that, our view to value creation will continue to be an extremely dynamic one. We're not led to the past simply because it is the past. We spent the last two years creating a new company, a new cost structure, a new portfolio. We're now creating the supply chain and the organization structure and culture that will allow us to drive, sustain, balance top and bottom line growth and are encouraged by the prospects.","The next question. How do you think about FX and how do you respond to it? It might be helpful to briefly, very briefly recount how FX impacts reported earnings, or as you know, three impacts. First, exchange rates affect the local cost of imported finished products and raw materials. We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing when local legal requirements and market realities allow it. What was a lag between when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution.","Second, we need to re-value transactional related foreign currency working capital balances at the end of every quarter at current spot rates. This includes a revaluation of working capital balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate on different currencies. Balance sheet revaluation impacts are most pronounced when currencies make significant inter-quarter moves, such as the sharp devaluation of the Mexican Peso in November.","Last, is income statement translation as a result of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollars or functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rates. Given the complexity of our global supply chain and the volatility of currency markets, the degree to which each of these impacts effects us in a given attributable can vary quite a bit.","We've managed through more than $4 billion of accumulative FX impacts over the last four years, nearly half of fiscal year 2012 net earnings. Of this impact, about 30% was from transaction, 20% was from balance sheet revaluation, and the remaining 20% was from translation. At current rates, FX is more than $0.5 billion headwind to the current fiscal year, an increase of more than $300 million since our earnings last October.","Our primary approach to mitigating the impact of FX movements is operational hedging. Where financially feasible, we try to denominate expenses in the same currencies in which we're selling products. One way to do this is with local manufacturing. As we localized manufacturing, more of our labor costs are denominated in local currency, more raw impacted materials are sourced in local currencies. There are limits, though, to localization benefits. It would not make financial or operational sense to build blades and razors plants in 120 companies \u2013 countries, for example. Many material inputs, such as pulp, lauric oils and the crude oil derivatives are globally denominated in dollars. About two-thirds of our global commodity spend is dollar-denominated.","We're sometimes asked why we don't simply hedge away the remaining FX exposures. It's a good question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we prepare our financial plan. The three reasons we typically don't end up choosing to hedge the majority of the exposure. Up to two-thirds of our foreign exchange losses and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian Peso, the Egyptian Pound, the Russian Ruble, Nigerian Naira are some examples.","Second, hedging is neither free nor necessarily cheap. Currency volatility increases this cost. The last shortfall as having as the answer is it solves nothing longer term. It does nothing to help us restore the fundamental margin structure of a business. It simply defers volatility. While it takes time and there's a lag between the hurt and the help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. Russia provides a recent example.","Two years ago, when the Ruble devalued we relax, we were left with negative gross margins across our portfolio of products, requiring us to take action. We initiated pricing and monitored consumer and competitive reaction, making adjustments where needed. Over an 18-month period, we took five pricing actions, resulting in a net 25% price increase across the portfolio. We made product sizing changes to ensure affordability with the pricing. Simultaneously, we aggressively reduced non-value-added costs, and worked to improve our product mix. Our operating approach is measured and practical. It is not defined by a fiscal year or a quarter. It often takes longer than that. We can't stand still but we also can't get out of balance.","Next question. Are we considering any changes to our capital structure? Should we be more leveraged? We remain committed to strong cash returns for share owners as an important part of overall shareholder value creation. Over the last 10 fiscal years, P&G has returned over $123 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchase, and share exchanges. We've returned 100% of net earnings over those 10 years. We have paid a dividend for 126 consecutive years, and we've increase the dividend from 60 consecutive years. Our dividend payout is over 70% of net earnings compared to a U.S. peer group average of about 54%. Our dividend yield is currently over 3%, a four point higher than the S&P 500 average.","At the start of the fiscal year, last fiscal year, we forecasted that we would return up to $70 billion in dividends, share exchange and share repurchase over four years through fiscal 2019. With $15 billion returned last fiscal and about $22 billion projected for this year, we are making good progress towards that goal. We believe we are in a good spot, with our AA minus credit rating and should retain it, particularly as interest costs are poised to increase and as potential tax reform creates uncertainty about future deductibility of interest expense. We're financing around $30 billion in debt at an average interest rate below 1.6%.","Commercial paper makes up about one-third of our debt portfolio. We've been able to access the CP market in several European companies at negative interest rates. Overall, we are borrowing at 70 to 80 basis points below 10-year treasury rates and below 5-year rates. We are among the \u2013 these are among the lowest rates in our industry. A downgrade would provide additional leverage that could be used to purchase more shares or to issue a special dividend. This will obviously be a one-time benefit. It\u2019s not a recurring source of cash. Additional debt service, an increase in the cost of debt service and a less efficient mix of debt, with lower CP capacity, essentially overset \u2013 offset over time the modest cash return benefit.","Finally, we received a number of questions about potential impacts from U.S. policy changes related to trade barriers, tariffs, and tax reform. While we certainly appreciate the appropriateness of these questions, we are guessing and right along with you on what the impacts may or may not be on our business. That said, there are few facts that might be helpful. P&G produces 85% of the products themselves in the U.S. domestically, and we export about 10%. So a net import balance of only about 5% of U.S. sales. The majority of the small amount of imported product is produced in Canada. We estimate that over 90% of the materials we use to manufacture products in the U.S. are sourced domestically. Material imports occur primarily in the case of insufficient U.S. supply. ","From our experience in many other markets, local supply constraints are usually taken into account as governments consider tariffs or other border adjustments. As always in tax and trade, the details matter very much, not just the headline rates and rules. As more details are known, we will update you on how they will affect our business.","Now wrapping up, as I said before, we leave the second quarter essentially on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives, despite unforeseen significant setbacks. We're increasing topline guidance. We're continuing our work to crawl out from under additional FX hurts and we remain on plan to return about $22 billion to shareowners through a combination of dividends, share repurchase, and share exchange. Hopefully, you found this question-guided discussion a helpful one.","I'll now be happy to take any additional questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning. My question has to do actually with the hair care business specifically because I know last year CAGNY that was an area where you cited particularly robust innovation pipeline and all that. But the U.S. market share data has not been good in recent months. So when you called out that as a category that has been particularly strong. It has accelerated, can you explain where that\u2019s coming from is it that the U.S. isn\u2019t accurately reflecting what you are seeing, because there have been any pipeline sale, is it international market, is it non-track channels. And what\u2019s the sustainability do you think of the strength in hair care given how competitive that category is? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thank you, Wendy. The strength in the U.S. is primarily behind Heads & Shoulders and Pantene both of which are doing very well. We are not doing so well on the balance of the portfolio, the smaller brands particularly Herbal Essence. We are just as we speak relaunching Herbal Essence. And I talked earlier in our prepared remarks about the naturals based focus of that launch and we're very excited about that. So part of the dynamic here has been different growth rates across the brands. But we are again relaunching Herbal Essence as we speak.","Across markets we continued to do well in markets like China. Hair care has done very well in Latin America. So there's also a geographic dynamic that's driving the overall aggregate result. You mentioned non-track channels. That's a significant impact and is going to be increasingly frustrating for this community I think. If you look at the U.S. on an aggregate P&G basis, I don't have the data with me for just hair care. But if you look at all of our categories, there is about 1.4 difference or 1.4% that explains the difference between reported growth rates and something like Nielsen and our growth rates that we're reporting through our earnings release. That increase is dramatically when you go to a market like China where that delta is up to six points. So that\u2019s also one of the drivers. And we are doing relatively well from a hair care standpoint online.","I think the program. I know the program strengthens going forward. We're bringing new initiatives to market not just on Herbal Essence but on Pantene and Heads & Shoulders across geographies. So we feel reasonably good about the sustainability of the growth that we've been delivering more recently.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning. So I want to focus on organic sales. First the full year organic sales growth guidance raise is that more due to upside from the first half of the year that you already reported or you also more optimistic about the second half that it should be better than what you originally expected. And does the first half outperformance give you greater confidential and the year growing in line with the categories you previously articulated. And then to the last question, you mentioned the gap between on track and track channels. In the U.S. it looks like it was a couple of hundred basis points in the quarter. So I just want to get more specifics particularly in the U.S. across your business. Is that just that on track channels have really accelerated or the things like shipment timing in there? And do you think it\u2019s true for the industry or is it more of a P&G phenomenon?","Jon Moeller","The answer for your first three or four questions is yes. So we did do better in the first half than we expected we would. So we're at about 2.5% through the first six months and we expect to improve that. Modestly as we go through the back of the year. So, yes it reflects progress to-date, yes, it reflects our confidence in the back half, and yes, we would expect we hope to get close to market growth rates as we exit the year. As I\u2019ve said in our prepared remarks, we expect the fourth quarter to be stronger than the third quarter. There was always the swampy straight line but the answer broadly is yes. In terms of other things besides the non-track channel dynamic, driving differences between what you\u2019re seeing in our reported sales numbers and the market base numbers.","There are always puts and calls in different markets. For example, in China, Chinese New Year fell very early this year. And so there were some part of the normal inventory load that occurs ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday but this year occurred in December. Last year it would have occurred in January or February, I can\u2019t remember exactly when the holiday was last year. So there are those dynamics but broadly I think you can look at the 2% on the quarter is a pretty good number representative of the general strength of the business. It might be just a tad high because of dynamics like the Chinese New Year timing and different year-to-year promotional items but there\u2019s nothing very significant or concerning within that.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. I have a question on SG&A and a question on just pricing. Suppress me with the second one, it was clearly flat to down everywhere and below FX, although you keep saying you want to offset FX and I want to understand whether that kind of the strategy or really just a determination of a weak consumer. And I ask that I guess in the context of is the plan to grow really from market share versus category growth, we\u2019ve all seen the Nielson numbers, for example, slow down, but on a global basis. That\u2019s question one.","The other one on margins, really, as I totally guess the gross margin of 210 basis points of productivity, I think that's great. I want to understand does that continue. So should we expect 200 basis points of improvement in our gross margin from productivity and for how long? So is that sustainable? And then on SG&A specifically, only 20 basis of productivity; I frankly have a tough time with the benchmarking numbers. You're putting up there saying you're actually better than peers without including scale and everything else. But you're 20 basis point seems a little low and I want to get a sense of whether you should expect that to ramp up. And then the 80 basis points reinvestment, how much of that is sampling versus actual kind of advertising expense increase? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","All right. I can't really \u2013 can't possibly answer all of those questions, but I'll take a shot at the big ones within that. In terms of pricing, when we look at pricing, inclusive of promotion, as a component of our top line growth that was neutral on the quarter. It's been neutral to positive for the past 24 quarters consecutively. It has been positive for the last 12 years. So as relates to the promotion part of the question or potential part of the question, as I've said many times, we will be competitive on promotion, but it is not something that we typically lead with. We would rather spend a dollar on innovation or equity when we have that opportunity.","In terms of the flat pricing in the quarter and its vis-\u00e0-vis FX increases; I mentioned when I was talking about FX that there's often a significant lag between when the FX hits us and when we're able to take smart pricing. And if you think about what's happened in the FX markets over the last, call it, six quarters; most of the increase that we're talking about \u2013 we talked about $500 million of FX impact versus year ago. I mentioned that $300 million of that has occurred since we reported earnings on October. So the pricing environment that exists in the market now is reflective of a more neutral FX environment and we'll have to see what happens going forward.","We are very cognizant that with a broad dollar move against most currencies that our pricing flexibility will be somewhat limited or will be less than it might otherwise have been. Nonetheless, it will continue to be part of the strategy, but they'll be a bigger component of cost reduction, mix management, sizing et cetera.","As relates to margin, I think the gross \u2013 and I honestly don't have in my head the exact gross margin numbers quarter-by-quarter, I just don't think about things that way. But the general order of magnitude you've seen is representative of the strength of the productivity program. That's going to differ quarter-by-quarter depending on commodity impacts, depending on how much volume we ship. But generally I expect to see a healthy gross margin contribution as we go forward.","Recall, we mentioned that our next $10 billion productivity program, the majority of that would be in cost of goods, which is part of the reason why you see a divergence between the gross margin benefit from productivity and the SG&A benefit. 20 points a quarter on SG&A, I\u2019ll take that, make time. We obviously have more opportunity ahead of us as I said and we'll see how that progresses. At the same time we've talked about reinvesting in things like sales coverage which we are doing. And that is also reflected in the overall numbers.","I think I\u2019ll leave it there and feel free to get back to me later in the day Ali, if I missed an important part.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks. I'm going to actually try to ask one question, not seven. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about innovation. I thought one of the things I picked up at the Analyst Day around that Tide Pure Clean that was really interesting was the notion of lean innovation, and try to move a lot faster, and bringing things to market in particularly things that are going to be increasingly consumer relevant.","So can you talk if there are other examples of where you are already putting that lean innovation mindset to work or if that's still very much on the calm? And then any other kind of notable news flow that we should be looking for in the next couple of months. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thank you, Lauren. Lean innovation is in its early days in terms of both learning and implementation. It offers significant opportunity for the reasons you describe, quick learning, quick response, lower cost learning, more shots on goal. I was just in a meeting for a couple of hours yesterday afternoon with some of the leadership team on lean innovation. And some of the pilot programs we were applying in that to try to improve, again, both the cost profile, the speed to market, and the number of ideas that we\u2019re screening. So we're very excited about the potential it holds, but it's early days.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers","Great, thanks. Hi, Jon. Just going back to sort of the demand building efforts that you've been making, I was just hoping if you could frame and quantify the magnitude of the year-over-year increases in demand building this quarter, and I'm thinking across trade, spend, A&P sampling, both a little gamut relative to the run rate looking backwards over the course of fiscal 2016 in Q1 versus where you think that trends going forward. I'm trying to figure out if we're at a relatively steady year-over-year increase or if we're poised to accelerate further or decelerate that kind of thing. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Sure, Steve. With pride and we've talked about this a couple of times too both ensure that our demand creation efforts are sufficient and that they are sustained. One of the problems that we created in the past was a fair degree of volatility and support levels for the business. And that's why I made the remarks that I made when I was talking about the bottom line guidance in the context of FX that we're simply not going to make those choices. We're going to continue to support the business in a sustained fashion through the balance of this year, through the balance of next year.","Our support levels are pretty ratable quarter-by-quarter throughout this fiscal year. I don't have all the base period numbers exactly in my head, so I'm not sure what all the index comparisons would be. But I think what you've seen is symptomatic of what you will see going forward.","It's not just though the marketing and trade spending that we're viewing as investments in demand creation, it's also the investments in capability which comes in several forms. We've talked coverage which we're investing in. We've talked about category mastery, both building and hiring and from the outside, we've been doing that. We've talked about category dedication. We've talked about increasing the flexibility of our operations to respond to changes, whether there are changes in opportunities, whether they\u2019re competitive, trade initiated or otherwise.","And so all of this were hopeful has an impact on demand creation. All of us this were hopeful as market accretive in its approach. And we still have a lot to prove, we still have a lot of work to do. But so far it's progressing in the direction that we had hoped.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi ","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Jon, can you just give us an update on in-store execution. I know about something that we talked about at the Analyst Day and kind of some of initiatives we're putting in place to really make sure you get the right assortment merchandising, limit out of stocks et cetera. And has ever been a discussion internally at P&G regarding moving perhaps the P&L responsibility to the customer teams versus the category or the geographic level? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thank you, Nik. I mean clearly in-store execution is another important element going back to Steve's question on sufficient demand creation, significant number of consumer choices on brand and product are made at that shelf. So having the products available, having them be presented in an understandable and compelling way, that\u2019s all incredibly important.","A couple of things here; one, we are whole supply chain transformation. You're familiar with I think the fact that we now are operating these Mexican centers in the U.S., which is designed to get us closer to consumption and are designed to reduce auto stocks. We have significantly improved auto stock levels across our customer base through that, so we\u2019re very happy about that. And this is an initiative that is going to be rolling globally in markets is appropriate. So we expect to continue to improve that. It\u2019s very important.","We\u2019ve also tried to get clear and clear alignment between our brand teams and our sales teams on what are the drivers of both market growth and brand growth in an in-store context. And then frame the tree programs and our execution in store against those drivers, key business drivers and be very focused and really, really, one or the two or three drivers that matter most.","That we\u2019re measuring performance against a combination of those drivers, which are different by category was that delivered in-store and gross margin or gross contribution. So there is an element of profit responsibility and profit consideration that is occurring all the way down through to sales professional in the store. And this is an area I frankly think we have a lot of upside in. There is some great work going on around the world and it\u2019s a clear driver of our business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Hey, thanks. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of things that you are seeing from the key things you are thing that give you the components to raise the organic sales outlook because that to back pretty far to see the last time you guys did that. And is it more function of the category is getting better or that your execution is improving to because it was look like all care to category seems to be getting better. But then some of the source parts in your product grouping there is still some challenges at we\u2019re seeing there like in diapers. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thank you. In general on an aggregate basis category growth continues to decline at a very modest level, but it is declining. Some of that is developing market dynamics associated with some of the big currency moves. The U.S. is essentially, it is very \u2013 it\u2019s pretty stable, may be a slight uptick here or there. So the majority of the progress that has been made is really execution and very little that, in fact I would have to look at specific good numbers, but I would expect that the category growth driver of our growth as a negative in the whole equation, modest negative but a negative.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Hey guys, good morning. I just want to stay on the concept of demand creation for a second and the increase investment you guys are doing and things like sampling and salves coverages. I was just curious in terms of a more broader question the trend that you\u2019re seeing in the overall cost to acquire a customer and to keep that customer versus where it was a five years ago. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","There are actually more options available to us to attract customers to our brand and more tools than there probably were five years ago, so done right. There\u2019s no reason that the cost of acquisition of a customer should be hire today than it was five years ago. Having said that, there\u2019s a lot more complexity in the shopping environment, in the media environment and done wrong, you can\u2019t increase pretty significantly and efficiencies in the cost of customer acquisition. I really can\u2019t give you a more specific answer than that Joe, but I don\u2019t see customer acquisition cost has been significantly increased or inflated as we go forward. We can reach consumers and shoppers today and much richer, more direct ways than we ever could.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Good morning. First one Jon housekeeping question, I don\u2019t believe you gave it. I apologies if you did. Can you provide global category growth and maybe separate that by EM and DM. And then the second piece I wanted to come back to a comment you made and we\u2019ve touched on a lot of these topics, but just to sort of underscore the importance here. You talked about long-term investment, even if it means P&G\u2019s results and the below the current guidance of mid-single digit core constant currency.","And that sounded new to me and you tend to be very joyful about the language that you use. So is it just a matter of the stronger dollar and less ability to take pricing, is just a matter of promotion ramping maybe a bit more than anticipated. I just want to kind of come back to that and maybe underscore some of the key drivers behind that comment, thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thank you, Kevin. We talked about this both last year and this and we\u2019ve done it. We talk about in the context of FX, which is what\u2019s relevant again this year. We need to support our businesses in a sustainable sufficient way and we\u2019re going to do that. The challenge of doing that and delivering and EPS number and the current environment is almost entirely FX. It is not \u2013 of course there are examples by category what promotion levels of increased or by country work promotion levels of increase, but on a broad scale basis as we look over the total business.","That\u2019s not the driver of the challenge from a profitability standpoint it is FX and commodities and I talked about $500 million of FX, $300 million of which has just come on since October and about $200 million worth of commodity costs. We\u2019re committed to work as hard as we can to offset that making smart choices on cost and ideally continuing to push the top line as well. What we\u2019re not going to do is reduce investment that\u2019s working to drive growth just to deliver a near-term quarterly number. So that\u2019s all we\u2019re saying.","And I think that that is maybe inconsistent in totality with our past. I think it\u2019s very consistent with the last couple of years how we\u2019ve been approaching the business. In terms of market growth, developed market growth is about 1% overall, developing is about 5%, not a significant change in either versus the prior quarter that yields about 3% global growth, there obviously significant differences by country, but that\u2019s the aggregate look at that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Hey Jon, good morning. Can you just like add more detail to the delta on the commodity in FX inflation because I think it was $0.12 before and it\u2019s $0.26 now? So you kept guidance obviously, I guess sales are modestly up. So can you just talk specifically how you even try to make up for that gap? And then can you just talk about to the category that stood out good and bad. So like the overall care business obviously came in way better. Was that market share gains or was that acceleration in category growth and then just very briefly in diapers, you talked about higher promotional spending. What is the strategic rationale for that, because I know you\u2019ve talked pretty extensively about promotions being sort of like short-term fix and not a long-term your brand equity driver, thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thank you, Bill. The strategic rationale for the increase in production at diaper category is competitive response. I\u2019ll just leave that there. In terms of Oral Care, we\u2019re making very good progress on both our paste business, but also on our more high end brush business, the automatic power brushing. And that\u2019s growing extremely well in markets like the U.S., but also in markets like China.","In terms of the breakdown of FX, I mean you talked about 12 points going to 26 points about three quarters of that occurred since October and it\u2019s across currencies. If I were to show you a graph today of currencies that are down and up. I\u2019m sure you have one sitting on your desk, as it is they\u2019re all there\u2019s been a significant move that\u2019s occurred. And as I said earlier it\u2019s different by category by country. But we\u2019re going to try to recover that yet through a combination of price increases whether relevant, size and changes, mixed cost. And there really isn't one answer. I apologize, but that gives you an aggregate feel for how that happens. It's markedly different by market by currency. And one of the big differences is a yuan or euro functional currency competitor impacted by the valuation in a specific market or not.","Another variable is, what\u2019s happening to local inflation and how our local competitors cost structure is being impacted by what\u2019s happened. And they have a reason to price or not. Another factor is where are we, in terms of category leadership or followership are we the number one brand or we the number three brand. That has an impact.","So it is a very granular gain and a very executional gain but one that we frankly despite issues within a given quarter, I\u2019ve done generally fairly well at over the last four years offsetting the $4 billion of affects, nobody likes the $3.80 or whatever the EPS number is the people feel were stuck on. But it could've been a whole lot worse. And we\u2019ve done I think a very good job of managing that, and Kevin, I towards managing these in more effectively from a growth standpoint on the topline as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Good morning, thanks. Jon, taking to step back, maybe you could give us little bit more in the genesis of this call I mean it's a different format and kind of walking through the Q&A, it\u2019s earlier I think this is the earliest you\u2019ve ever reported at least that I can remember in terms of since the quarter close and ahead of some of your competitors and you obviously had a message you want to get out there.","So, are you frustrated with the stock price? Do you not feel like people understand what\u2019s going on with P&G after the Analyst Day or there just key issues that you wanted to get out, I mean, just little more color would be great, that was kind of a surprise, obviously to see reporting this early and kind of going through this format.","Jon Moeller","Sure, sure, sure. This was a fairly clean quarter for us and it's obviously not a year end quarter. So we were able to get our accounts together and fairly short order. And having an earlier call, frankly, allowed me to take advantage of scheduling an opportunities next week and it\u2019s simplest that. In terms of the format, I just didn\u2019t thank you while that go through the Analyst Day, March again, since that was about available for you online. And that's essentially the format we\u2019ve used before us to walk-through productivity walk-through portfolio, walk-through topline. I thought I would just diversify a bit and make sure all of the ground was hopefully, helpfully covered for you and that's all there was for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Good morning, Jon. Thank you so much. As always, I\u2019m very interested in what's going on in China with particular interest in whether the heavy discounting in the diaper category has continued. And if you expect that to mitigate at any point, who has the consumer become used to 20% lower pricing. The other area in China would be detergents, where you\u2019ve had some strong local competition and Oral Care, where you\u2019ve had strong local competition, because just bring us up to date on that that would be helpful.","Jon Moeller","I want to step back in China first and then I\u2019ll get to your specific questions. I think it's very important that we understand that China continues to be a very attractive opportunity. This is a market that is among the highest growth rates across the world on a sustained basis and that really hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s a market that as we've talked before, premiumizing significantly customers are trading up to better performing products across categories.","As we move out of the one trial policy, there\u2019s certainly only upside that exist there, as the economy transitions from more of a manufacturing based company to \u2013 economy to a degree of a more consumption-based economy. That\u2019s significant upside and we have a market position there and capabilities that, that allows us to take advantage and participate in all of those upsides. So China continues to be \u2013 as you know it's our second largest market both in terms of sales and profits. So it\u2019s also a big focus area for us.","I mentioned on the call that David and I were there last week. No better way to start the New Year than to go to China. And the business is responding fairly well overall. We went from minus 8% quarter\u2019s not very long goal to the quarter we just completed plus 3%, first half was plus 2.5%. Obviously we still have some work to do, because our markets are growing depending on the category mid-singles.","In terms of specific categories Oral Care, we're doing fairly well and that\u2019s being driven primarily by power brush and by our Oral-B pastes launch a very premium dual phase product that\u2019s doing very well. It is a limited distribution, but that distribution is going to be expanding as that has proven out. We do see continued promotion in the diaper category, but it's important to note that at the same time that that\u2019s happening, that\u2019s really a competitive driven dynamic.","At the same time that's happening, consumers are continuing to trade up to premium tiers. And that is by far the fastest growing segment of the market. So the notion that consumers in China have become if you will price-sensitive, that\u2019s certainly not what we're seeing. This is a competitive dynamic that reflects in some ways the size of the opportunity that reflects in some ways changes in frankly, currency rates and regulation. But it is not something I would expect categorize the category for extended periods of time.","And we certainly \u2013 it\u2019s certainly not a reflection of a desire for lower price on the part of the Chinese consumers, who is very focused on product quality and product performance. Detergents, our Ariel liquids lunch is about on a target with where we expected it to be. We do have as you mentioned very good, strong, local competition, but we also have two very good and strong brands on Tide and Ariel and continue to work to build that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Thanks very much, Jon. Just one question on Fabric Care. There\u2019s been a significant competitive entrant to reentrant into North American Fabric Care. And I think a lot of people have been wondering what implication that might have, when you think about maybe Fabric Care globally pricing little down and then significantly down relative to our currency. Just kind of trying to understand, what's going on? First of all, how North America \u2013 what North America pricing looks like the comment on that. If competitive entry there, or any place else is \u2013 you just mentioned China but it\u2019s having an impact. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","The pricing environment in the U.S. market for detergents has become more competitive over the last quarter or two. As a result, you\u2019ve seen market growth rates go from positive to slightly negative. And that's being driven as much by anticipation on the part of competitors as to what the new entrant is going to do. Then it is anything else. And we'll see how that plays out. We\u2019re \u2013 in terms of how that strategy \u2013 how Henkel strategy is going to play out, it's way too early for us to know that. Our best play continues to be to strengthen our brands both from a product efficacy standpoint and a consumer delayed standpoint, which we continue to do.","Operator","Next we go to Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi, Jon, good morning.","Jon Moeller","Good morning.","Bonnie Herzog","In light of the tough competitive environment in many of your key categories, how much further pricing promotion do you think is needed to drive share. And then you\u2019ve talked in the past about getting your price ladders right in your different categories. So I\u2019d be curious to what percentage if your business now has the right price ladders in place versus what percentage still needs to be treat. And then maybe highlight, which categories might need the most work. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Sure Bonnie. I'm limited in what I can say about future pricing directions legally. But I can talk about current status in general strategy, which I'm happy to do. The majority of our portfolio whether that\u2019s defined by category or by a market is where we feel we need to be from a price ladder standpoint. There are clearly some categories, a couple of categories where we have opportunities.","And again, I really don\u2019t want to name categories, but I bet even I \u2013 if I wrote them on two separate piece of paper we\u2019d find some of the same names. Those are factored into our plans that we have articulated today, we will be competitive on price. But again, we\u2019re not going to lead with promotion as a way to grow market share. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a sustainable way to grow our market share because there\u2019s absolutely nothing proprietary about it. It can be repeated in a nanosecond, which is matched \u2013 which is very different than either cutting edge innovation or idea inspired equity building. So there will be a mix but we will be competitive. We\u2019re generally where we need to be but not in every category country combination.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen","Thanks. Hi, Jon. I had a question on kind of multi-channel discussion you outlined earlier. You mentioned that the company\u2019s aggregate online share is comparable or equal to its offline share. I\u2019m wondering if there are any specific markets or categories, one or two where that that is in the case and you think there is more work to be done. But you could talk a little bit about those and what your intentions are there. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Probably, the primary example of where we have more work to do that matters from a size standpoint is China. In aggregate, our online shares in China are below our offline shares. We\u2019re making a lot of progress though. I mentioned $1 billion in sales in online this year not 20% of our business, that business \u2013 the online business is growing at 30%, 40%, 50% clip depending on the month of the quarter. And we are building share. Our online share is growing. It is not yet though to the same level as our offline shares. And that\u2019s probably the biggest example of where that\u2019s the case. And in some other markets, we\u2019re over developed from an online standpoint. And again it differs dramatically by category.","You can appreciate that categories like power brush, like our electric shaving business, some of the \u2013 certainly the diaper business are very well-developed online and some of the others a little bit less so. But if we were to get and I expect we will get China to market share equivalents online versus offline. The aggregate statement I would be making them is that our online shares are higher than our offline shares.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan","Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to follow-up on the commentary on the omni-channel and wanted to be where consumers shop. So just curious, has there been a change in discussions around pricing and maybe broader product support for your brands giving increasing challenges faced by those traditional retailers and assuming need for greater reinvestment to drive the traffic. I mean, any sort of commentary on last couple of years, last six months, whatever it is that you\u2019ve seen \u2013 that you could talk about, it would be helpful.","Jon Moeller","Everyone, whether they\u2019re an online retailer or an offline retailer is participating in the race to drive traffic to their specific channel or chain. The biggest help we can give any retailer whether online or offline are indispensable brands that consumers need and want. That is by far the biggest driver of traffic for them. And creating offerings instead a relevant for their shopper, which may be different across channels. If we have products that are not irresistibly superior and don\u2019t delay consumers, the notion that we\u2019re going to drive store traffic on those items with a lower prices is a hard one to get comfortable with.","So we\u2019re really focused in our discussions with our retail partners on driving their market basket and market growth through better performing brands that ideally are indispensable to consumers. We\u2019re also very focused with them on making our joint operations as cost efficient as possible, which gives them inherently more pricing flexibility or marketing flexibility than they would have otherwise have. And that\u2019s a big part, certainly not all of the part, but a big part of our approach on supply chain transformation has been designed inherently with this customer enabling focus in mind and reducing their costs as well as our costs, increasing shelf presence in terms of availability, which helps both us and them. So that is by far the majority of the conversation.","Operator","And sir, your final question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for squeezing me into here. Congratulations on another relatively solid quarter especially the progress in the U.S. Its boost to aggregate topline is apparent; I presume this is also an important driver of why mix from a gross margin headwind is abating. So my question is really around sustainability of the U.S. We talked a few times throughout the quarter about the deviation in terms of reported results from what we can see in our data. But from what we see in the data it is kind of concerning.","Overall sales eroding but reported sales sort of accelerating and despite a lot of your comments Jon on promotions and not wanting to lean too heavily it looks like you are leaning really heavily on it. In the data and sort of underlying non-promoter base sales eroding even further. So the data sort of raises questions of whether we have a bit of a transitory disconnect between the data and results, which we see from time-to-time, which usually rever or whether this is now just really different if we had step changes sort of on measured contribution that its going to keep this delta widening on the forward. Can you give us some more color on that and give us a little more reason to sort of not believe the data we\u2019re seeing the consumption.","Jon Moeller","I\u2019d say a couple of things, Jason. If I step way back and look at for example strength of program, front half, back half, I talked about that previously, I don\u2019t see a big change there. Innovation improves and increases in the back half in the U.S. We\u2019re increasingly getting the coverage patterns that we want to have in place with the talent and deep category mastery in place across the U.S. So I don\u2019t see anything at an aggregate level that says that U.S. sales should decelerate. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me in a given quarter that instead of being plus two, it\u2019s plus one \u2013 that\u2019s kind of the range that which I am looking.","There are categories in the U.S. where promotion intensity has increased significantly. And what I am not saying is that, we\u2019re not participated into them. We need to be competitive, I\u2019ve said that several times on this call and we will be competitive. What we won\u2019t typically do is lead promotions spending. There are also times when certain competitors for a very good reasons, we will take a list price decline. And our most efficient response may be at time as for a period of time to increase promotion to get to the right price spread versus our competitor. So well that tactically looks like a differential increase in promotion. It\u2019s all about getting to a net price. Again, us being responsive to what our competitors offer.","So happy to talk that more with you later day Jason, that\u2019s helpful. John and I will be around the balance of the day. Thank you for your time. And hope to see most of you here in a couple weeks at CAGNY.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen and that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.","Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning.","David Taylor, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and John Chevalier, Vice President, Investor Relations join me this morning.","I'm going to provide an overview of Company results. Dave is going to update us on four strategic focus areas superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization and culture. I'll close with guidance for fiscal 2020, and will of course take your questions.","For the fiscal year, we just completed organic sales up 5%. Core earnings per share up 7% currency-neutral core earnings per share up 15% adjusted free cash flow of productivity 105%. $12.5 billion of cash return to shareowners.","Each of these metrics in line or ahead of objectives set going into the year. GAAP earnings per share are lower, reflecting a one-time non-cash accounting charge to adjust goodwill and intangibles carrying values of the Gillette shaving business. Grooming continues to be a very attractive business, organic sales up year-over-year. April-June sales up 4% a truly global business with strong market positions a highly profitable and cash generative operation. Initial carrying values for Gillette were established nearly 14 years ago in 2005.","We significantly over delivered acquisition cost synergy commitments but as outlined in each of our quarterly filings for the past three years, this global business has faced significant an increase in currency impacts over the last decade.","Lower shaving frequency has reduced the size of the developed blades and razors market. More recently, and much less of an impact new competitors have entered at prices below the category average. These factors caused us to reduce the accounting and carrying value for this business on our balance sheet.","As I mentioned earlier, all core metrics organic sales growth core earnings per share growth, currency neutral core earnings per share growth adjusted free cash flow productivity, cash return to shareowners in line or ahead of objectives set going into the year.","All of this progress against strong headwinds. Foreign exchange, commodities, transportation costs and tariffs created a $1.4 billion fiscal year after tax headwind, a 13 point negative impact on core earnings per share.","Within this currency had some more than $900 million after-tax. Large markets with significantly weaker currencies. British pound, down 4%, Mexican peso down 4% Chinese yuan down 5%, Russian ruble down 12%, Brazilian real down 18%, Turkish lira down 14%, the Argentinean peso down 97%.","Commodity cost increases of $400 million after-tax. Pulp up 14%, resin up 7%, propylene up 10% and kerosene up 16%. Trucking costs up significantly in the U.S. with increases in many additional markets annualized tariff impacts approaching a $100 million. All overcome with innovation-driven volume growth, pricing and productivity, yielding strong results for the year.","Happy and a strong year, a very strong April-June quarter organic sales up more than 7%, the four quarters of the fiscal year for 4%, 4%, 5% and 7% on the top-line volume, pricing and mix, each contributing to top-line momentum. Broad based growth in all 10 global categories is growing organic sales. Skin & Personal Care and Personal Healthcare each up mid-teens, Fabric Care and Home Care each up double digits, Oral Care and Feminine Care up high-singles, Family Care and Grooming each up mid single digits.","All six geographic regions also growing organic sales. India, Middle East and Africa up mid-teens Greater China up double-digits, North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific up high singles. Europe up mid-singles. Strong organic sales growth in our two largest markets, up over 7% in the U.S. 10 out of 10 categories, growing.","Continued progress in China improving from a 5% sales decline in fiscal '16, 1% growth in fiscal '17, 7% organic sales growth last year. Fiscal '19 growth up 10%, up 12% in the April June quarter.","Global e-commerce organic sales of 25% now well over $5 billion in annual sales, were about 8% of the Company total. Strong and improving market share trends aggregate global value share up versus year ago 33 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing value share in fiscal 2019, up from 26% in fiscal 18%, 23% in fiscal '17 and 17% in fiscal '16. So in chronological order 17%, 23%, 26% and now 33%. 8 of 10 global category is holding our growing share.","On the bottom line, core earnings per share of $1.10 up 17% versus the prior year, up 26% on a currency neutral basis. Fourth quarter margins improving both sequentially and versus year ago. Core gross margin up a 120 basis points.

In summary, we delivered or over delivered on each of our going-in targets, other than GAAP earnings per share. We did this while offsetting a foreign exchange commodities transportation and tariffs tsunami. We built momentum on sales, share and margin as the year progressed.","We delivered very strong constant currency core earnings per share growth and continued our best-in-class track record of cash return to shareowners. We still face challenges and continue to operate in a very difficult competitive and macro landscape. Our work is not over, but we're making progress behind the integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies.","David will discuss next, David?","David Taylor","Thanks Jon.","One of the most encouraging points about the strong results we've delivered is the breadth of the progress we've made across the categories and countries. The breadth of growth, gives me confidence that the strategies and focus areas that are guiding our choices and investments to the right ones. It also gives me confidence that we're building the capabilities to sustain the growth at or above market levels. The mutually reinforcing strategic choices, we've made are critical to the progress.","We focused and strengthen our portfolio, in daily use categories, where performance drives brand choice. In categories where we occupy a number one or number two position, which have historically grown faster than the balance of the Company and are more profitable.","In the benefits of the portfolio choices are clearly paying out within these 10 categories where performance drives brand choice we've taken a deliberate step to invest in and advance the superiority of products and packages brand communication retail execution and value advantage, growing the markets in which we compete, and strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We've raised minimum standards of competitive advantage across each of the superiority drivers and are investing to meet or beat these new standards.","And superior offerings drive market growth, and this is one thing that's incredibly important about the plan, increase in consumption, creating additional usage occasions, bringing more spend into a category grows the market. This creates top line growth it is typically more sustainable than simply taking business from a competitor, it creates a winning proposition for our retail partners. The pie expansion versus zero sum.","It's a positive versus negative spiral and when where - where we grow markets disproportionately and more sustainably, we build share. We've spoken a lot about the role of product and packaging superiority and growing markets in P&G share but communication go-to-market and value must also win.","We start with understanding our consumers and their needs wants and aspirations, we then create advertising that makes you think, talk, laugh, cry, smile, share, and of course buy. Advertising that drives growth for categories and brands. Advertising that clears the highest bar for creative brilliance, sparking conversations, affecting attitudes, changing behavior and sometimes even defining popular culture.","This year at the Effie Awards, which recognized the most effective marketing communication P&G won the top honor of most effective marketer and Tide won the Grand Effie Award at the Cannen Lions International Festival of Creativity. P&G advertising earned 16 lions, three gold, six silver and seven bronze, In Effie event we announced the series of innovative new creative partnerships that reinvent advertising by merging the world of advertising with other creative worlds.","Such as film making, music, comedy, journalism and technology. Superior in-store and online execution also grows categories in our brands, the right trade coverage with category mastery with the right product forms, sizes and prices and the right in-store or online presence in merchandising execution, delivering against key business drivers for each category and brand across all channels in every store, every day.","On the last earnings call and recent conference presentations, Jon is taking you through some of the recognition we received directly through some of our top customers and then third party retailer assessments of manufacturers capabilities.","We very much appreciate each of these recognitions, but what really matters is retailers improved view of P&G as a partner in joint value creation, driving superiority to grow categories earned stronger distribution, share shelf, display and feature.","The fifth element of superior execution is a winning consumer and customer value equation. For consumers, this means a product that meets an important need and noticeable in superior way with the package that enhances the usage experience with compelling communication presented in a clear and shoppable way at a compelling price.","For the customers this means margin penny profit, thrift generation basket size and very importantly category growth. We're going to continue to work to make progress in superiority extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution, which will require ongoing investment.","The need for this investment and the need to offset the macro cost headwinds we talked earlier and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth including margin expansion underscores the importance of productivity. We are driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of the business.","Now just past the midpoint of our second five-year $10 billion productivity program. Through our productivity efforts P&G has maintained and built its status as a highly profitable company. In the past, Jon has shown you the charges before and deserves PD. P&G's before tax operating margins are among the highest in the industry, behind only Reckitt and Colgate whose margins reflect their concentrations in healthcare.","We have significant below the line advantages operating with one of the lowest interest expense percentages and one of the lowest tax rates, putting us near the top of the industry in after tax margin, already highly profitable and aggressively driving more savings. These results are due to a sustained intense focus on improving productivity across all cost falls and we will continue to focus on this, because it will be a critical driver of our success.","Superiority and productivity are critical, but insufficient to keep us ahead in a world with rapidly changing retail environment, quickly evolving consumer needs, media transformation and revolutionary changes in technology. We must and are leading the constructive disruption of our industry across all areas of the value chain.","We are disrupting the way we innovate by accelerating the speed and quality of learning through LEAN innovation. This new approach is delivering significant benefits in time and costs, helping to reduce our learning cycles from months to even days. We're monetizing innovation across industries to accelerate investment in R&D and broaden societal impact.","We're disrupting retail execution SK-II is using AI supported technologies to enhance the consumer shopping experience with personalized recommendations based on smart scans of a person's skin, product browsing on virtual shelves and shopping through the wave of a hand, it's the first augmented reality retail environment which merges physical and digital technology to give the shopper exactly the skin care regimen needed in new smart packaging that features a companion app for personalized skin care every day.","Going beyond broad demographic targets to deliver exactly what she is looking for solutions designed to work for her. We're reinventing brand building from wasteful mass marketing to mass one to one brand building fueled by data and technology.","We're moving from generic demographic targets like women ages 18 to 49 to more than 350 precise smart audiences. Like first time moms or millennial young professionals or first time washing machine owners to reach the right people at the right time at the right place. We continue to show up our supply chain with transformation across the globe.","In Europe, we've optimized the distribution in manufacturing infrastructure to fewer scaled multi category operations in optimum locations, manufacturing sites are now down 30% and distribution centers are down 35%.","We'll make an organization structure and cultural changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization, focusing effort, clarify responsibility, increase in accountability and structuring compensation and incentive programs to better align with these objectives.","We have an incredibly talented organization of more than 90,000 fully committed people they moved mountains for years to deliver the progress we're discussing this morning; they deserve the credit. We have historically put in their way a lot, competing management structures, lack of clear accountability, lack of end-to-end decision making many people who can say no and few who can say yes.","On July 1, we moved to new organization structure designed to de-matrix of the company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability. We are operating six industry based sector business units or SBUs. The SBUs have profit and loss responsibility for the largest markets, the focus markets, which represent about 80% of sales and 90% of profit. The SBUs CEOs are focused on winning and driving value creation opportunities in these important markets.","We're optimizing the remaining markets which we are calling enterprise markets to accelerate growth in dynamic macro environments. The benefit of this design is the creation of more focused, agile and accountable organization operating at a lower cost focused on winning through superiority fueled by productivity and operating the speed of the market.","North America was the pilot region beginning three years ago for the end-to-end SBU approach in China, following a year or so later. The success of this design is evidenced, by the sales and share progress we've made in both of these markets. We are committed to winning everywhere we choose to compete across both the focus and enterprise markets and we want to win the right way. We want to be a force for good and a force for growth.","We've integrated citizenship and how we do business, enabling us to have a bigger impact on the people we serve, the communities in which we live and work and the broader world that surrounds us. In turn this helps us grow and build our business. I hope enabling us to have a bigger impact on the people we service the communities in which we live and work in the broader world that surrounds us.","In turn this helps us grow and build our business. I hope this is evidence that we have been disrupting P&G. The choices, we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice to established and extend superiority of our brands to lead constructive disruption across the value chain to make productivity an integral part of our culture, just as much as innovation and to improve the organization, focus agility and accountability. These are not independent strategies they reinforce and build on each other.","They position us well within our industry to deal with near term challenges from macro headwinds, trade transformation and anticipated competitive response. And they are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid and long term.","Now going to turn it back over to Jon to cover our outlook for fiscal 2020.","Jon Moeller","We provided details of our outlook in the press release published this morning, so I'm going to focus on the primary guidance metrics in this call. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 4% where operating markets - in markets that are currently growing at a rate somewhat above 3% on a value basis.","Our guidance range brackets current market growth with a bias toward continued share growth, while still expecting a strong competitive response. The range also implies acceleration of two-year average growth rates moving from 3%, two-year average growth for fiscal years '18 and '19 to more than 4% average organic sales growth across fiscal years '19 and '20 in a market growing somewhat above 3%. On the bottom line, we expect core earnings per share growth of 4% to 9% getting us back to our target, mid-to-high single-digit range.","Neither top line or bottom line guidance ranges are layups. Both represent meaningful sequential progress. Innovation-driven market sales and share growth, meaningful gross margin expansion, while investing and product impacted superiority increased investments in media and other demand creation marketing programs. Base period comps that include the Boston land sale, and the gain on the sale of two Oral Care brands in Europe.","Fiscal 2020 will continue a long track record of significant cash generation and return to shareholders. Ultimately, the most important and enduring measure of the successful enterprise. We're targeting another year of 90% free cash flow productivity; we expect to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 to $8 billion of shares in fiscal 2020.","Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, current commodity prices, current foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range.","Now, let me hand it back to David for closing comments.","David Taylor","We delivered our fourth strong quarter in a row, continue to build top line momentum and improving the quality of our bottom line results. Market share has been improving for eight consecutive quarters, our efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry leading margins to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability to constructively disrupt our industry are driving improved results.","But we know our work isn't finished yet to further strengthen results, we will continue to accelerate the pace of change. The macro environment and strong competition are sure to percent new challenges in the year ahead. But we're better positioned to manage through these challenges that we've been in many years.","With that, Jon and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","You guys have just finished, what is arguably your best here in about a decade. So can you just talk through like sort of order of priority and the changes you made that have led to this the improving innovation and the portfolio changes divestitures, you did a several year ago and how the organizational changes that are now in place help to keep out that's just - help up-- help to keep that up that sustainability? Thanks.","David Taylor","The strategy truly is working and we keep reinforcing it but I come back to it. The combination of first, starting with the consumer, making sure we delight the consumer and we do that through superior products packaged communication, go-to-market capability and value is really making a difference and what allows us to sustain and you're seeing this now over three years in more and more category country combinations is an organization design that is putting accountability closest to where the market is in a way that's working and we've clarified responsibilities with focused markets and enterprise markets recognized in - not all markets are exactly alike.","And to me what we've seen increasingly each semester, if you will, the organization respond clear priorities, clear strategy on superiority. They understand if internalized and doing a great job on productivity across all cost buckets and we continue to work to clarify the organization design in a way that delivers an engaged, agile and accountable organization and you're seeing that better and better.","It was reflected in the employee survey this year where the confidence in the strategy, went up significantly by folks across markets and GBUs, which to me speaks to me an alignment of 90,000 plus people on a plan that's working, and that's why I think you're seeing the sequential progress that we've seen quarter-to-quarter, semester-to-semester, and we really look year-to-year. And so it's very encouraging.","Jon Moeller","I would just add a couple of things that David addressed in his prepared remarks. The first is, and it's the thing that gives me the most confidence and sustainability of results is delivering growth by growing markets.","And there are many examples the inflection in the rate of the laundry market growth in North America and other markets behind PODS, significant acceleration in the rate of the market growth of fabric enhancers behind things like beads. significant doubling actually of the growth of the adult incontinence market through all was discrete and there are many other examples.","But those tend to be much more sustainable and much more profitable than when we're simply taking share from competitors. The second piece just briefly is and David also mentioned, this is the importance of balance. That's the only way you sustain this level of growth and investment and still offer return to shareowners.","We need to grow both the top and bottom line the year and the quarter that we just completed our evidence of our ability to do that and we've got a leadership team that's committed to continue that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I was hoping I would ask a question, looking for some example, tangible examples. Because so much of the brand reinvestment work in portfolio work that we've heard about that you guys have talked about has been very U.S. focused and sometimes sitting here it's a little tough to get a full picture of the P&G world. So if you could talk a little bit about some things that are maybe happening in other focused markets, just an example would be we read last month about this relaunch of oriental therapy skincare in China. Just if you could run through some of the - may be to focus on China some of the portfolio work that you're doing that we may not be that aware of just sitting as we are in the U.S. Thanks.","David Taylor","Lauren there are many examples, then we could kind of run around coefficient categories, but I'll just give a few just to sprinkle around the world. Other than the U.S., if I look in Europe where you've seen an acceleration of growth, our dish business and I think auto dish is when we haven't talked a lot about, we've rolled out Platinum across many of the countries, it's, again - it's a trade up.","It's a superior proposition and we've seen meaningful share growth across many countries in Europe where auto dish now is one of our faster-growing categories. If we look in China, we've given many examples over the last couple of years. We now have Fem Care growing double-digits. You've got laundry growing and you've got beads and PODS and then you've got just a series of initiatives across almost each country on whatever is the most appropriate for that country.","The two of them that I mentioned, are those dishes in Europe and frankly several of them in China. But that's true as well, we almost go to every focus market and there'll be a list of them, but it's hard to list one because each of the 10 categories now has a very specific innovation plan that addresses what it takes to grow the markets and better delight the consumers and even our expansion markets. Our newer brands are also doing well. So it's a broad base support right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","So first just a clarification, the Q4 top line result was so strong. I'm wondering, if you included any timing benefit of retailer inventory shifts and if that might impact fiscal Q1 and then you were clear in your prior answers on the internal momentum and what's driving that internal momentum. I was hoping you could give us a bit more detail on the level of risk from an external standpoint. Just as you look at a competitive standpoint on both pricing and marketing reinvestment going forward given a number of your competitors have publicly announced margin resets recently. So, I love a bit more detail on what gives you confidence behind continued market share gains and how you think about that external environment, thanks.","Jon Moeller","Dara, I hand your second more important question to David. On the first part, though, we did see small inventory builds and a couple of customers primarily in the U.S. who increase their commit - their service commitments to their customers relative to the number of days or hours that they were going to have products delivered to their - to their shoppers and they built a little bit of inventory to support that. For perspective, though the organic sales growth rate in the fourth quarter, if you exclude that small inventory build would have remained or does remain well over 7%.","David Taylor","And the second half on competition, certainly our eyes are wide open and we respect all our competitors and yes, we have followed the many announcements on investments in becoming more competitive and we're aware of the guidance that they publicly offer, what we're trying to do and have continuously been doing though is staying focused on the consumers on market growing innovation, if we maintain superiority when we see innovations come out in the marketplace to ensure there are innovations deliver on meaningful superiority, then I think we're well placed.","Part of the reason, we've continued to emphasize the need to generate productivity as we anticipate that we're going to have to invest. It's - we don't know exactly where, how much of what category, but we know that if we can continue to invest meaningful or rather create meaningful buckets of investment opportunity then we're able to remain competitive in the key markets.","To date, we've seen a number of innovations come on from our competitors and to date, we've been able to address those with our innovation and where possible, our intent is to provide innovations to grow the category. And then that environment it frankly, doesn't create a destructive market situation. We have shifted our focus over the last several years on market growth and on meaningful superiority across the five elements.","We're mindful of and aware of what competition does, but we've made sure we don't get distracted on chasing a specific competitor and or innovation, instead play our game and stick to our strategy and it's working well.","Jon Moeller","And there is a concern, the concern that the competitive environment is heating up as a valid one. It's only logical and natural. But what we're seeing so far. Take the U.S., for example volume moving on promotion indexing at 94 in the last quarter, versus year ago. So generally we're in a fairly constructive environment where people are trying to innovate to grow markets and that's the game that we like.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","I guess I'm going to try to jam into one, a quick follow-on to Daren's question. Your guidance calls for commodities and currencies etc. all kind of be net neutral. So certainly a lot more accommodative than we've been in the past and presumably, this is - this is the same type of environment for our competitors and you overlay the investment, how do we think about category growth and particularly in context of the price trajectory as those dynamics play out.","So that's part one, and then part two is still sort of linked to it if commodities, currencies, etc. kind of go net neutral for you and you deliver the productivity ramp you have, it looks like you should have around 260 basis points of margin tailwind from productivity, midpoint in guidance seems to suggest around 80 bps implying that there is over $1 billion of reinvestment is that math roughly right and if, so where do you expect that reinvestment to go to.","David Taylor","Jason, I'll take the first part and I'll let Jon address the margin side. First on category growth rates, as Jon mentioned, they've been relatively healthy. And frankly, if we continue to do our job and if competition does innovate in constructive ways then I think the categories remain healthy. And if I look across the world, the U.S., which is our biggest market has been very constructive at 3% or better. Europe, it's been - it's a 2%.","Our view going forward, it's probably about 2%, maybe a little bit softer next year. The India and Middle East and Africa areas in mid-to-high single digits, at least mid-single digits. China, there has been a modest slowing down, but still very healthy in our categories we're seeing, call it high-single digits 7, 8s and we haven't seen a major slowdown, just a little bit of softening.","Asia Pacific more like two, Latin America has actually been sequentially improving, Brazil sequentially improved a bit from a recession to now modest growth, call it one to two, but that's encouraging versus where it was before.","So broadly what we look across the focused markets, the top 10 markets we're seeing constructive growth rates and at least in our categories we bring meaningful innovation. We're seeing a tick up and that's - that the - to be the strength of this strategy is you've got a consumer right now that is interested in our categories, and the innovation that we're delivering is ticking up some of the growth rates. where we have a meaningful share in most of the categories we participate. We do have meaningful share. So that works well.","There's very few places, there aren't growing now in our major markets. India, is one I did mention, it's double digits and frankly as we look forward, right now we don't see a reason why it wouldn't stay and in the 10% to - 10% to 12% range. So, with the exception of what I call modest growth in Europe, many markets are growing faster in Europe is very solid and profitable. So we like that region as well.","Jon Moeller","And on the income statement question, I think your observations are generally correct in terms of directionality. We should have under current - under the current macro assumptions, the ability to grow margin and to reinvest in maintaining and building our levels of superiority.","Also, as you look at the comparisons remember that there are several significant one-time gains in the base period that we have to lap as well, but we are very cognizant as I think, is reflected in the conversation we're having here about the competitive nature of our categories, our need to continue working on superiority, the investment that's required to do that, but still being conscious of the need and I think the ability to grow margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","I guess I was hoping maybe you could zero-in and just expand on some of the benefits that you're getting from the focus on the lean innovation initiative that David, I think you talked about in your prepared remarks. Just maybe an example or two, you could share that illustrates the continued progress on that front. And then, I guess what I'm really interested in, is the benefits that you're getting. Is that really measured just in terms of speed to market or is there early evidence that the - that lean innovation can actually lead to improved consumer acceptance of the products that are yielded by that process.","David Taylor","Steve, I think the advantage of lean innovation are meaningful across many dimensions. First, there are several examples, we've given in the past. Pampers Pure came to market much, much faster than it would have in the past, because we had a small team dedicated working on it, they fell in love with the problem, they were trying to solve developed the product, the materials, the communication and then went to market, it's done very well.","We gave in the past, I think the example of micellar water in China, which was the line extension on Pantene that's now been added to many brands in many other countries. The benefit in seeing one is speed. The second is a number of hypotheses that we can advance in one problem area and what happens then if you find the consumer idea that's more powerful and given the illustration, if you have one hypotheses you do a large space test, you can get a significant break on a 300 base test.","You test 10 and have small teams and only give them 20 base size, you have to have a major advantage in order to break significance and we actually like the smaller base size, because you have to have a meaningful advantage to be significant. And what we're getting that out of this is, we're testing more ideas and finding bigger ideas, then we can focus on incubate and then advance and whether it's Pampers Pure or micellar water there's many more to come to market.","The last comment I'd make and I think we've released some of this in the consumer electronics show or others the number of transaction learning experiments we are going now which allowing us to learn fast with small teams with relatively small investments. Is at a very high level and that gives me confidence again we're going to find ideas, consumer ideas and business propositions that have great promise with minimal investment.","The idea is you want learning to stay ahead of investments and as long as that happens to me, along with the focus on delighting the consumer to me, we're going to see a robust innovation program come out of our 10 categories each of the 10 categories has a growth works effort to make sure they're growing the core first and foremost.","But also looking at underserved or fast-growing areas that we can enter and win in. And the lean innovation allows us to explore more of those at a cost that's affordable and what you're seeing is accelerated top line and continued strong productivity efforts. So it's done, you can do more with less people and arguably with a better employee value proposition because it's more exciting work.","So we're quite excited about it and we're staying in the learning mode, we're learning from people inside and outside the company and to me this is an area that holds great promise going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","I'm going to try to squeeze in two if I can. One of the areas that Procter has been addressing for the last few years has been instructing execution. So David, Jon maybe you can just give us some metrics on kind of how things have progressed there how things have improved and then the second question is, you talked about data and kind of targeting consumer groups in a more specific fashion. But I'm just curious like as you think about the next three to five years how good is Procter's data capture as it relates to individual consumers. So you can actually target Joe or Jon versus first time mothers. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","In terms of in-store execution is obviously very broad topic, which extends out of the store. So for example, one of the biggest things we need to do is be on stock on a shelf and or behind the shelves in the case of a virtual shopping environment and we've made a lot of progress there coupled both by or driven both by the joint business plans we have with our retail partners, but importantly also the reconfiguration and transformation of our supply chain, which puts 80% of our production within 24 hours of the shelf and allows us to significantly increase service to customers which turns into service to shoppers.","We're also working to do a better job of delivering in in-store experience, that's consistent with what we know our key business drivers are which are different by category, different by channel and ensuring that we're measuring performance of our sales organization, not just on physical distribution, but delivery of key business drivers in store. A huge number of brand choices are made in front of a shelf, whether it's a physical shelf or a virtual shelf.","And ensuring that - that shelf serves that shopper enables them to select the item this right for them is a significant focus. And I could go on. But this is an area where we still have a lot of improvement opportunity, but we've made significant progress.","David Taylor","And on the second half of your question we're actually quite excited about this smart audience work that we're doing in the past, we've had broad demographic groups that we targeted with our media and it's always been said that half your media is wasted and you still don't know what happened.","And we have the data now to find out what have it is and we have developed a very large proprietary database. We have over a 1 billion consumer IDs worldwide meaningfully over that. That allows us to have these smart audiences and once you have the smart audiences, you can do propensity marketing with people that have similar characteristics.","We have a much larger number of cookie data that allows us to touch devices. But we like best where we got unique consumer ideas - IDs and we run programs around the world and we certainly ask consumers and allow them to opt in. But then we collect data, the right way and use it with the appropriate privacy restraints and to make a meaningful difference. It's part of what can fuel the lean innovation work we're doing because we can get very targeted audiences to test new business ideas new products and new propositions.","So I think going forward is only going to get more powerful as we continue to collect data refine it and become more accomplished at performance marketing to taking that data use it in a respectful way to serve consumers products and propositions and messages that meet their needs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I actually wanted to ask about your Baby Care business. First and then second positive of course. I would like to hear more about what drove the improvement. And then I was hoping to get your outlook for this business and really what you guys need to do to continue to improve it. Do you still think additional price adjustments will be necessary and maybe the mid and value tiers? And then given any innovation coming in the U.S. maybe on the premium end to counter the new innovation from Kimberly? Thanks","David Taylor","Bonnie, I give a couple of comments first overall for global Baby Care. There is a very robust innovation program with myself Jon and a team of the most senior officers in the company have spent an extended period of time with the Baby Care team looking at the next three-year strategy including the innovation program by tier, for major markets.","And certainly, we don't announce in advance when we are coming with major innovation but, but the premium in the mid-tier and some of the specialty areas, we have a robust innovation program and it will be coming sequentially and coming fast.","If I step back though Baby Care improved the fiscal year with organic sales from last year to this year. Global organic sales did grow in the fourth quarter, we've seen an acceleration on most markets in the back half. China importantly, in the fourth quarter turned very positive to plus 8 U.S. plus 2. This is for China in the first time we've had sales and share growth in five years and it's been driven by the results in both premium tape and pants.","So those two combined are driving meaningful growth in China. U.S. Baby Care is making progress, we know we have work left to do. Pure protection is doing well, sweaters is doing well, pants is doing well and we're making - we have innovation coming that will improve the superiority in the mid and value tiers and that will be competitive.","We have our eyes wide open. We understand there's other participants in the category and it will be something we have to sequentially, continue to work on. But both global baby, U.S. baby. And then if I look at China Baby there is encouragement and we're excited about the new bundle that's launching this month in China.","Pampers Pure into a super premium tier with natural cotton taped in pants, diapers with natural cotton. We have a product on tape and pants featuring cloud soft diapers with visibility. We have upgrades coming right now on mainline and premium, which we [indiscernible] and new itch bond plus taped with double breathable layers.","So each of those tiers. We have meaningful upgrades coming. So yes, it's robust and yes, it's competitive and our eyes are wide open and recognize this will be one of continuous innovation. It's just a highly engaged category for consumers, but still attractive.","Jon Moeller","And your question about pricing, obviously we can't comment on future pricing, but you should expect as we try and do preimmunize the portfolio that there are pricing opportunities associated with that premiumizations will take advantage of.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","So question for a high level, is that - it seems like the end markets are really accelerating here in terms of total category, in addition to that, you're improving your market shares. So I want to see - is this analogous to call pre-recession levels, when we are in a trade up economy when you saw a lot of premiumization across the different categories. That will be a one perspective and then the second follow-up question for Jon would be. Could you unpack the commodity versus transport versus FX, a little bit are all three going to be relatively muted or as the net effect that they just kind of level out, maybe two or of one is down? Thank you.","David Taylor","Steve, again, I'll take the first as you requested on the growth rates. The growth rate looks to be pretty stable, they're not accelerating, but they are stable at a very good place, and again our innovation is working to grow categories where we can, as I mentioned earlier, they are in the three to four range, a good three right now, it varies by country.","But in the most important market for us, the biggest markets it's pretty healthy. U.S. is healthy, China is healthy, India is healthy, Europe is stable at around two and Japan another large market is flat, but yet we're growing share. So in general, we feel pretty good. Whether it's the strongest, it was pre-recession and I have to go back and look at in 7%, 8% range before it hit 6%, 7% range.","I think we were in the 4% to 5% range then we're right now and I call it the 3% to 4% range. But we feel good about that and what we have seen to your point, when we offer premium products that have meaningful advantages in many of our big markets. The answer is yes, they are trading up, you're seeing that in some of the specialty areas, the natural for sure. It's an area we've been very active. Our Always and Tampax pure, it was launched March of '19 is doing very well the L. acquisition is doing well native our deodorant acquisition is doing well. Pampers Pure we've mentioned before.","So there is many examples Tide, beads, Tide, PODS and the Downy Beads, those are also examples of premium price products where consumers have traded up and they offer delightful benefits. So, yes, on the trade up when you have a meaningful consumer experience advantage and I'd call it healthy relatively stable growth rates of three to four call it 3% to 3.5% right now.","Jon Moeller","Jon, the second part of your question in a very broad sense. I would look at currency is year-to-year. This is going into next year as a relatively minor hurt. If you think about markets like Turkey and Argentina where there's been significant devaluation that hasn't yet annualized. If you think about what's happening in the U.K., and what could continue to happen in the UK. That's certainly not the order of magnitude that we saw last year.","Having said that, if we were having this conversation last year at this time, I would be telling you the same thing, only to update you on our next earnings call with significant hurts. So it's a very - what I would say it's a constant in that space as volatility, but on a spot basis today a slight hurt.","Commodities, on the other hand are a slight hurt on a spot basis that also is a very volatile environment. When you consider the petro complex and all of the natural gas as our biggest commodity exposures and there's a lot happening in the world that can affect those prices. But right now, a small positive transportation, good news is neutral, and hopefully we'll get to the points when we annualized some of the hurts that turns into the small health year-to-year. So that's it in a nutshell.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So a couple things, one is just obviously organic sales growth 7%, very pleasing to all of us. Can you give us a sense of how much of that growth is true, same-store sales growth versus shelf space gain growth versus kind of broader distribution reach growth? I've asked similar questions before but I guess I asked in the context of the guidance of 3% to 4% we get your lapping tougher compares, trying to better understand what the drivers of the actual expected slowdown are along those metrics.","And then the second question is, if one were to pick a little bit, one would look perhaps at margins and see that even the gross margins were up 120 plus basis points. SG&A investments were higher. Of course, to drive the top line but heavier investments throughout the business, higher comp expenses and that seems to be a pattern across consumer packaged goods. So want to kind of elevate a little bit, if you can maybe David, it's part of your constructive disruption, you've talked about, but can you talk more specifically about where the industry is investing clearly performance marketing is example of that and whether we should think about this at all, is kind of a profitable pool shift in any way in terms of other places of the ecosystem. So are retailer getting the benefit here? Or are there other partners getting the benefit of this reinvestment? And whether that investment just have to stay at this elevated level to get to this 3.5% category growth or whether you think that subsides over time. So thanks very much, about the specific in the broader question.","David Taylor","Let me start with the broader one and Jon is going to jump into specifics, but we can kind of bounce back on this one. First the broader question on the market and do I expect elevated investments are required to sustain this growth in many ways we have elevated the investments, and yes, I do believe we have to have meaningful productivity to cover both retailer needs for their value improvement as well as, continuing to meet the consumers' needs with what I expect will be elevated competitive action, but I think that's all doable within the current guidance and that's why we've given a wide range. There's a lot of things that could happen.","Having said that, what we are seeing though is the innovation that we've delivered is contributing to markets that are growing our data would say we are a significant part of the reason the markets are healthy in our categories, and we know we have a robust innovation plan coming forth this year and beyond.","Secondly, we know and we have line of sight to continue on our current productivity program that is generating meaningful investments and it is covering and we will continue to work with our retailers to ensure that they have - we have with them joint value creation plans that meet both needs. In those, we feel very constructive about. We don't overreact by quarter.","So, I don't get overly excited about an overly good or bad quarter. What we're looking for strengths over time and there is very clear trends over the last three years of increasing brand country combinations that we're growing share that breadth covers category and country, look at it by both ways and you see it moved up significantly from '16 to '17 to '18 to \"19, which again gives me confidence that this is a sustainable strategy, and I think the elevated investment is built into our productivity program. Jon.","Jon Moeller","I wouldn't have much to add. The one thing though I would make sure you understand. You can follow up with Jon on this, when you look at the elevated SG&A as a measure of investment. You need to take out of a significant increase year-to-year and our accruals for compensation, it's a 100 basis point impact on the quarter in SG&A everything that David said remains true with that excluded, but it's important to understand that as you think about the true year-to-year trend. And then on the top line, the only thing I would add.","You mentioned rightly the much tougher comps and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we are significantly accelerating the two-year average is in terms of the top line growth rate. We just need to do in an environment as we've all been discussing this morning where we fully expect continued heightened competition and to not allow for that reality within our guidance range would seem less than - less than prudent.","So we've done that. The way to contextualize the top line is we're growing at or ahead of the market with a bias towards growing ahead and that's, as I said in my prepared remarks, not a layup.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell, I'm sorry, Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","David, can you comment a little bit on Grooming the same way as you gave on the Baby - on the state of the Baby side, it was definitely refreshing to see the inflection on a two year stack over the past eight quarters, and as Jon Moeller was saying just now, I think that's an acceleration. But can you comment on how sustainable this trend is going forward and how the Gillette online initiatives can kind of sustain and also in the key markets to where you've learned from the experience in the U.S. that you're bringing over I believe the U.K. and as well, as the channels in club and then in particular, is your key competitor consolidated. So if you can give us kind of that state would be helpful. Thank you.","David Taylor","Very good. Grooming remains an attractive business, as we said and we haven't lost our enthusiasm for many, many reasons and we did talk organic sales, did grow this fiscal year and we had a good ending of the year. A couple of things that are, frankly, very positive about the future. One is the big new innovation called Skin Guard continues to pick up share.","It's already double-digit in several of the focused markets that we have launched it has been expanded around the world right now, and it addresses a very specific benefit of people that have sensitive skin. The strategy that we've pivoted to and I think will bear fruits over time is looking at the full ladder from double-edge all the way up to the heated razor.","So you go from pennies to very expensive products depending on what your need is. We're now more actively playing in disposables including with innovation and disposables with censorial benefits being delivered with things like Luber strips. We now have innovation across the mid tier, which is - in the mark line in the premium line. All those to me are important.","Then by market, we have to figure out what is the right ladder and what is the right demand programs to be able to drive trial and the other - we have to do and you've seen meaningful changes is figure out had to be relevant to GenZ and millennial and we've made progress there as well.","So the SkinGuard initiatives performing well. It's in U.S., Canada, parts of Europe and overall acceptance has been strong. The after use experience is very strong. So all of our efforts now are to drive trial and awareness and if that continues and that's a good tailwind for us.","We have our eyes wide open; we recognize we had a significant headwind on broad, societal trend on shaving and we're broadening our view with how we view Grooming and making sure we have products that also allow you to trim and other ways to take care of facial hair.","And so both the Braun and the Gillette programs to me a very active and robust. And to me that the plan going forward is robust. It will be both relevance, communication, innovation and focused on ensuring that we bring it to life in ways that work with consumers, each market in which we focus.","Operator","And then now we'll go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Just a question on the competitive response and what you're seeing. I know you expect competitive response to the market share gains in the strength. But just want to understand, like - are you seeing a different competitive response, because it doesn't seem that we're seeing the same kind of price cutting promotional levels kind of even around the world. But especially in the U.S., that we have in the past and so are the competitors reacting differently or you just - they haven't reacted yet. And so we're just kind of waiting for those price cuts to come?","David Taylor","We have seen competitive reactions. And I think broadly each competitor acting consistent with this strategy. I would characterize the market is constructive right now. You're seeing an increased level of innovation, which frankly we like and that's a challenge, we look forward to addressing. We're seeing innovation across all price tiers, that's again an approach that we're happy to address.","I believe that generally people have learned a lot from past actions and each company has to decide what their value creation plan is. And to date, I have not seen behavior that would increase concern on market attractiveness in the 10 categories in which we participate.","Operator","And next we'll go to Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Can you talk bit about media spending? I guess there's two conversations, one is a kind of increased focus on traditional media. And then also a conversation about increased spending, media spending directly with the retailers. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that going forward?","David Taylor","First, let me start with the macro headline. We're looking in at stronger media delivery, stronger programs at lower cost. We found ourselves in many cases over frequented. So our frequency of ad presentation was too high and our reach was too low we're adjusting that.","As we do that, we're finding efficiencies in our overall media program. And we've talked about the significant opportunities that exist within the media supply chain including media compensation, our agency compensation and production costs and we're working to reduce that all with the idea of increasing the overall effectiveness of our program which includes the right mix different by category for both traditional and digital media.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","I wanted to come back to the Gillette business as well. First the housekeeping question, just for Jon, on the impairment charge I understand it's non-cash, but more concerned about potentially what it may signal David said it pretty positive a moment ago and results have gotten better. So maybe just confirm, this is an annual requirement as opposed to some sort of triggering event that would be helpful. And then David, I think the question was asked earlier. I'm not sure you necessarily touched on it. Just in terms of the potential implications from Edgewell's acquisition of Harry's and bringing on their leadership team what they may bring your current views on the implications of consolidation in the space and how you see the competitive dynamic potentially changing. And what you guys have embedded in your outlook? Thank you.","David Taylor","We test each of our goodwill and intangible assets every year that's our requirement. And we've been indicating really for the last number of years that the cushion, if you will. In other words, the value that we're coming up with every year, as compared to the value that we're carrying on our balance sheet has been declining. If you look back at any of our financial statements over the last three years, you'll see reference to that. And we've talked about how that cushion has been declining.","The drivers of that are primarily two-fold. One is foreign exchange and you've got here a business with a very broad global footprint and particularly with the year that we've just been through that impacts that value assessment. The second, we've also had many conversations about which is the - the impact on market size in developed markets from overall shaving incidents, which is down.","And those two things as they get factored into our annual evaluation at some point, get us to a value that's less than the value we currently have in our balance sheet and that kicks in a pretty complicated process to get to the new goodwill number and Jon can take you through that offline as needed. But it is-- it's a nondiscretionary annual valuation test. That's led to this outcome has been clearly telegraphed. I think in our financial reports.","Jon Moeller","And I'll take the second part of the question. I'm happy to give more detail on Gillette. First that the Edgewell acquisition of Harry's does this propose additional risk to the business. It's still early, the deal is not closed and we generally don't speculate on what we think competition is going to do.","I will say a few things that we are doing that I think positions us well and broadly, if you step back, Grooming rather Edgewell is going to have to make money they bought a company we've seen both Unilever's acquisition of Dollar Shave Club and now the Edgewell acquisition of Harry's both of the parent companies that have bought those start-ups, need to make money and to me that's not a bad thing for the overall value creation opportunities in the industry.","If I step back again and look at what we're doing, we're doing more differentiation, you've seen our Joy of launch at Walmart has done very, very well as we can activate across the ladder. And what we're seeing now with our willing to differentiate we're rejuvenating both the Gillette, and the Venus brands, the campaigns that we've put out there are working they are engaging very much with GenZ and millennials and we've seen a significant positive 80% positive response millennials to our recent campaigns and there likelihood to purchase Gillette, which I think is positive.","Online, you mentioned the U.S. Gillette DTC while still smallest double than us in the past 12 months our e-commerce business is growing in the UK, when I think both competitors showed up, we in this time and we're much more competitive defending our business ensuring we provided attractive user experiences in value to those consumers.","And we've maintained share leadership in that segment. We've recently expanded Gillette DTC in Germany and Australia launched Venus DTC in the U.S. So we've stepped up ensuring that we can serve consumers on and offline. It's part of the superiority strategy, which is we want to win, where the consumer wants to shop, and while the majority is still done offline.","We recognize, we need to step up our game both user experience value and offerings, but direct-to-consumer more broadly in the e-commerce and have done that. So I believe we are well positioned. We see it as again competitive category but attractive category and the acquisition by Edgewell to me doesn't change our interest are frankly our confidence that the plan is robust.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","I'm wondering if you just step back and think about the last decade has been very challenging for the companies that have already got the big brands and I'm wondering when you might. If you do expect something to shift from advantage small disrupted to advantage P&G and this quarter may be an example of where things are starting to come together. You've seen it in the U.S., you've seen in China for more than a quarter more than a year. Do you think this is going to start happening in other countries and kind of a secondary question on this is how the organization changed such that Harry's or other disruptors are not going to be allowed to flourish before you move.","David Taylor","Just a few comments. Certainly, again our eyes wide open and we do see the environment as highly competitive, we understand there's a lot of new entrants in the category, but we don't have just a strong quarter.","We have got over the last three years, we've seen increasing brand country combinations grow and we've talked about the breadth of our brands and countries improving and we've got now four quarters of 4% or better, which I think is a meaningful sustained level of progress and we certainly expect we need these go out and continue to earn it.","Big brands continue to do well when they address consumer needs, they have to stay relevant and how they present themselves in both package and communication and they have to have an experience that justifies the cost and is better than the best alternatives and our big brands are doing well and we've extended our self into the fast-growing areas in many cases, it's been an extension of the parent brand.","You've seen that on Tide, you've seen that on many other brands. You've also seen that where we've gone into additional areas, whether it's the L. acquisition native Walker & Company and others to ensure we continue to learn.","To your question, do we think the organization is better prepared to deal with the competitive environment we're in. Yes, we have simplified the organization in a way where the focus markets to me have increased focus the enterprise markets because of the high volatility have an organization structure that allows them to address that and get and react much more quickly.","We've shifted broadly to an organization that is engaged much more agile and it goes to everything from how we innovate, which is small teams cycling fast to the fact that we now have one axis of decision making on primary choices that address this threat which is the sector business unit.","And so the need in the past at times to need to get alignment across the organization, it's been meaningfully reduced. We value the input from other parts of the organization, but the leaders that run the businesses are accountable in touch and they have folks in the market.","So, I think we're actually well positioned to see and then respond to competitive threats and if we do our job right, we understand the consumer needs and we're ahead of those. We're creating the new categories, opportunities in segments of growth and we're seeing progress there as well.","But it's highly respectful of our competition aware of increased competitive actions, but believing that this is a robust and sustainable strategy focused on the core superiority funded by productivity and then brought to life by over 90,000 people that have embraced this strategy, believe in it and are executing with increasing excellence.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Wanted to ask more of a broad kind of longer term questions so historically, your portfolio is heard less well during recessionary times, not that were imminently heading into one, but just curious how you think about readying the portfolio or how you think the current portfolio response during an economic downturn and how that we compare to where the company was 10 years or so ago. What's different this time around, do you think?","David Taylor","A couple of comments. One of the areas that I think causes us to be at least well-positioned to deal with whatever comes out is one we're in categories where performance matters to the consumers their daily use categories. So they don't go away, and frankly the need to engage with them, generally doesn't get reduced in a recession and the other is our brands today have broader ladders. We play across many price tiers and many benefit segments.","So, I think we're actually in many ways, better positioned, because we have now identified where we can create value in each category and then established the appropriate both price tiers and benefit delivery for that category and I mentioned automatic dish earlier.","We have a base; we have a premium then we have a super premium. That's true in the laundry category. That's true certainly in Shave Care, that's true in Baby Care. We have many segments represent VIM Care. We have multiple segments representing our Family Care business. We have multiple segments in our Oral Care business.","So if you look at that at least now we're playing in segments and then what we're doing better and better using the data we have is we're understanding the specific needs of consumers in each segment and designing to make sure we're delight but recognize part of the delight is a competitive price point and to me, we're doing that better in, but it gets back to superiority has to be in the eyes of the consumer or the customer or the evaluator and to me where we've raised the bar on the expectation of what we deliver to delight the consumer.","Jon Moeller","Everything that David says of course, extremely relevant. I would just emphasize one point that he made which is the difference in the portfolio. Just think for example of not of Swan Hair Care, Prestige Fragrances much more discretionary items in which discretion is exercised when times get tough.","We have categories now that as David said daily use staples, it doesn't mean we are immune to trade down but that - that goes to his point of having a broader ladder of offerings, the right size offerings in the store then address tightened cash outlay needs, etc.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","So you've told us since 2013, if I add up all of the citation for currency headwind that you've got had what has amounted to something like a little over $2 in today's tax rate and share count, in total currency impact over the past six years. And I guess I'm wondering is it really just as simple as had we had a flat dollar since 2013, you'd be making 40% plus more and presumably, if currency ever reverses or just stays the same, is that just to just think about or if it reversed back to 2013 levels proportionately would we expect to get that as a tailwind in the coming years. I know you cited Jon that currency is still a little bit of headwind for next year. Thanks very much.","Jon Moeller","I mean, directionally, and you can go back and compare our earnings per share to the currency movements over time you can do it on an industry level and you will see a clear relationship between those two. Having said that, as you can imagine in the scenario that you cite where things go back to 2013 levels what ultimately ends up happening from an EPS standpoint it's going to be dependent on pricing moves that competitors and others choose to make as a result of that. So it's not that simple. But directionally, it is tough currency years are tough earnings years, easier currency years are easier earnings years.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Two questions please, first in April of this year, Amazon went to next day prime delivery and saw a sharp acceleration in their business. I'm wondering to what degree you also sure saw an acceleration in your business with Amazon. I know that you've got very well coordinated logistics shared warehouses with them, just like a little bit more detail in terms of how your business with Amazon is evolving. Are you gaining - getting share gains there and do you see this close coordination as a sustainable advantage and the second question has to do with the detergent category grew 5% volume in the quarter? Hard to believe that our global industry is growing that fast. So maybe a little bit of details in terms of where you're gaining share and what's going on in that category. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Let me just provide a little bit of summary level response to that and then I'll give David the detail. We don't comment on dynamics what individual retailers for reasons I'm sure you can readily understand. But we feel very well positioned broadly and we certainly view Amazon as a very strong partner.","In terms of the question on detergent, I'll answer that more generally, too, which is, with the exception of what I mentioned earlier, which has been a small inventory build and customers looking to shorten delivery times to customers in the U.S. We have not seen significant changes in retail inventory levels. We are pretty much tracking our sales growth with consumption growth in most of the markets in which we're operating. So that volume growth you're seeing is largely consumption driven.","David Taylor","And let me add one point on that, just if you could kind of unpack a bit Fabric Care - Fabric Care is more than laundry. Fabric Care also includes fabric enhancers. So you get everything from dryer sheets to liquid fabric refreshers all the way to beads. And that category fabric enhancers is what we call it has been growing very nicely.","Faster than the what you consider the detergent category because you're probably right. You're not going to see a huge spike in detergents, but one of the things we've done in that category and many categories is broaden our view of the benefits we can provide that is why we call it, Fabric Care not laundry.","And in Fabric Care there's many things you can do to extend the life of a fabric and to deliver a variety of benefits beyond just clean or stain removal. It can be antistatic; it can be softening. It can be extended freshness over time, and we do that in a way that's delightful for consumers and created a very large business. Fabric enhancers is now - I think over $750 million business and growing and that's part of what's been a driver of fabric cares outsized growth and they've just done a beautiful job again understanding the consumer need in this broad category called Fabric Care and doing it very well. And it has contributed to an acceleration in category growth in many markets.","The U.S. is probably one of the best examples. If you go back many years, it was flat to 1% and it ticked up several percent behind Tide, pods, beads and frankly we've reinvigorated even the beads business by again delivering benefits in communicating the compelling way.","So part of what every category has to take on is market growth is a key part of the sustainable strategy we have and you're seeing more and more examples of superior innovation driving market growth, which then allows us to have the balanced top and bottom line growth that we aspire to deliver.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen","Just one quick one, you're kind of eight years now into 10 years of productivity and cost savings, which have been significant. This is obviously critical as you've pointed out key to achieving the balance that you're looking for in the business top and bottom line growth with margin improvement. So as you kind of look out beyond two years and take a longer-term perspective.","Is the kind of the cost and productivity opportunity similarly strong as you look out over time, on an absolute or relative basis as it has been over the past seven or eight years with everything you've achieved? Thank you.","David Taylor","I don't have specific visibility to something that's out that far, but I will make a couple of comments. One is the earnings progress that we made and the progress we made in offsetting some of the FX items that Jon was referring to earlier was largely productivity based.","And we were very clear that was not a sufficient program or strategy that we simply had to get the top line growing at reasonable rates while maintaining a focus on productivity in order to create value. And so, hopefully at the end of the two-year period, you're talking about our top line is in fact sustained at a higher rate.","From a productivity standpoint. Well, I'm not going to talk about dollars today. What I would say is that there are increasing number of tools that are available, particularly in the digital space, which give us a reason to continue to become even more and more productive and more and more effective across our set of activity systems.","So that's, what I'd offer you today. The importance of productivity is not going to go away. The tools that we have available increase every day, but we also have to deliver that topline, which by itself from a leverage standpoint is a huge driver of margin improvement.","Jon Moeller","I think that ends the questions, and let me just close with one. Thank you for investing the time and discussing P&G, our strategies are beginning to deliver sustainable balanced growth and value creation. We have our eyes wide open; we know there's still work to do, but we're confident we're on the right track. We must continue and we will continue to build the superiority advantage. We'll continue to invest in productivity, but the credit goes to 90,000 people they are doing - 90,000 plus are doing a wonderful job bringing the strategy to life around the world and continuing to build value for all the stakeholders of this company. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17677":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call January 26, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - CFO","Analysts","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus","Steve Powers - UBS","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call.","P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. In the quarter we just completed, we continued reducing costs and reinvested in growth, reaccelerating our top line and delivering strong earnings and cash flow. Organic sales increased 2%. Core earnings per share increased 9% with constant currency core earnings per share up 21%. We delivered meaningful triple-digit basis point improvements in gross and operating margins on both a constant currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 37% and adjusted free cash flow productivity was 117%. ","This is a reasonably strong quarter which reflects our efforts to accelerate organic top line and earnings per share growth fueled by productivity savings. We continue to operate, though, in a very challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a volume and value basis have decelerated due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 2% to 3%. ","There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets: Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil.","Currencies are weakening across the board, more than three-quarters of a billion dollars since the start of the fiscal and over a $1 billion after-tax versus year ago. This is on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and nearly a $1 billion impact the year before. Across three years, FX has been a $3.5 billion impact over 30% of fiscal year 2013 core net earnings after-tax. Since the start of December, the current year FX headwind has increased by $300 million after-tax with a 40% devaluation in Argentina and additional 15% devaluation in Russia and nearly a 10% devaluation in Mexico. ","The relative strength of the dollar weighs heavier on us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. The dollar has more than doubled against the ruble over the past two years while our euro functional competitors are facing about 50% to 60% of that impact. We expect these dynamics: slowing market growth, geopolitical hot spots and a stronger dollar will continue to be part of our reality going forward. ","Against this backdrop, we\u2019re staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, without changing productivity, transforming our portfolio and strengthening category business models and innovation plans. This transformation strategy, as we\u2019ll explain more at CAGNY, is fundamentally a growth strategy. ","I\u2019ll talk briefly about each of these focus areas: productivity, portfolio, and business model and innovation plans before we get into the details of the quarter. ","We continued to dramatically improve productivity with significant upside still ahead. Our original five-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target. ","We\u2019ve reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity addition. On a same site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. We\u2019re targeting 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017. ","In February 2012, we announced we will reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of December 31, we\u2019ve reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target and are well on track to meet our revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017. In fact, we currently expect to reach our 25% to 30% objective this year, one year ahead of schedule. These figures exclude divestitures \u2013 including divestitures we will reduce non-manufacturing roles by over 35%. ","Continued digitization has been and will be a big enabler of our overhead and manufacturing enrollment efficiencies. We\u2019re reducing non-working marketing expenditures -- costs that do not impact reach, do not impact frequency. Last year we reduced the number of agencies we worked with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We\u2019re aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are non-working savings that enable us to invest in advertising and in trial of consumer-preferred products. We\u2019re strengthening our working marketing programs -- greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness, at less overall marketing costs. ","Last fiscal year in the US we increased total marketing and merchandising support behind Pantene by 440 basis points, increased Tide brand spending by 220 basis points and invested an additional 150 basis points in Fusion behind the new FlexBall innovation. This year we\u2019ve made similar increases to advertising programs in the US on Shave Care, Fabric Care; in Brazil on Baby Care and Fabric Care; in China on Fabric Care and Oral Care. In North America alone, we\u2019ve added nearly 100 basis points to advertising and in-store merchanting budgets since we started the fiscal year. ","In addition to cost of goods sold, overhead and non-working marketing cost reduction, we are driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. The moves we made on the balance sheet have enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2. ","We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We\u2019re also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, a 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past five years we have returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares, and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next four years. ","In addition to transforming our cost structure, we\u2019re transforming our portfolio. As you know we\u2019re centering our portfolio on 10 category-based business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. We will be a company of consumer preferred brands and products in these 10 product categories. ","Within these core businesses, we are also focusing our offerings to maximize value creation. We\u2019re making smart choices for short, mid and long term value creation or going-bad business even when these choices create short-term topline pressure. In our Mexico family care business, we made a choice to discontinue low-tier unprofitable products in favor of very profitable, higher tier products, albeit with lower sales. The top-line drag from this choice will dissipate over the next few quarters and will have a solidly value accretive business going forward. ","In India, we\u2019ve made a choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business which negatively impacts short-term top-line growth rates but will lead longer-term to much more profitable business that will grow strongly. Last fiscal year, organic sales growth slowed by several points but we made significant progress in improving local profit margin, up 700 basis points. We went from losing money in India to triple-digit profits. ","In the quarter we just completed, India organic sales growth was only 2%. The strategic part of the business, the part that we\u2019re maintaining, grew a healthy 10%. Sales in the portion of the business we\u2019re fixing or exiting, which is about 15% of the total portfolio, were down 35%. Profit is running significantly ahead of even last year's improved levels. As we come out of this, we will have strong top-line growth that is really worth something. There is really no point to grow if it isn\u2019t worth something. Choices like this impacted our organic top line growth rate by about 1 point in the October-December quarter but will enable us to increase profitability on an ongoing basis. ","As we\u2019ve improved productivity and sharpened our portfolio, we\u2019ve been strengthening business unit strategies, business models and product offerings putting particular priority against our four largest categories: Fabric Care, Baby Care, Grooming and Hair Care and our two largest markets: the US and China. We\u2019re focusing our laundry business on consumer preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium priced unit dosed detergents, and our market leading and market expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We\u2019re launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil and China. ","In Russia and Turkey where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G share of liquid detergents is up 7 and 11 points respectively. Fabric Care results in the US demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value for best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. ","The US laundry detergent category is continuing to grow, up more than 4 points on a value basis across all outlets over the last 3 to 6 month periods. Within this, our share is growing. P&G\u2019s US laundry detergent value share was up a point last fiscal year and was up a half a point in the December quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we\u2019re introducing a new regiment on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. 70% of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense collection anchored by innovation on Tide PODS brings the proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy fresh protect ordor defense beads, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of ath-leisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym. ","In the US Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communications, trial programs and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers\u2019 value share of U.S. diapers was up more than a point and a half last fiscal year and was up a point in the December quarter. The progress is particularly encouraging considering our latest Pampers innovation with Extra Absorb Channels was on shipment allocation for much of the quarter as demand succeeded our initial supply. With increased capacity in place and continued strong demand, we expect a good start to the new calendar year. We\u2019re increasing our investments in Luvs diapers in the second half of the fiscal year to address share declines following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. ","Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we\u2019ve strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms.","The Gillette FlexBall innovation continues to deliver strong results in grooming. Globally an estimated 25 million men have tried FlexBall in 18 months since launch. FlexBall has been an important catalyst of growth of ProGlide cartridges. ProGlide cartridge sales grew 18% last fiscal year compared to a 7% decline in overall male cartridge market. ProGlide cartridge shares is up 2 to 3 points in each of the past 3, 6, and 12 month periods through December. The strong ProGlide results set a very positive stage for our next cartridge innovation: Gillette Fusion ProShield. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Retailer response to ProShield has been outstanding, delivering launch orders and display levels well above targets. ","We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall, to MACH3 systems, to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags make Gillette much easier to shop. They take up less space on shelves so more product can be put on a peg, reducing out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates, and they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the change in several hundred stores with excellent results, and are rolling out hard tags as fast as we\u2019re able. ","We're also innovating online. With more men purchasing their blades and razors through e-commerce, we\u2019re establishing Gillette as the online leader. While we were admittedly late to build out our online offering, Gillette Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start. We\u2019ve increased our e-commerce share of blades and razors more than six points and nearly double the online consumption since launching Gillette Shave Club. We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers who are offering their shoppers subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club which have enabled Gillette to deliver record online sales in each of the past three months. ","In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the US earlier this month. Pantene\u2019s new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers weightless conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial area for conditioners. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competitors in North America, China and Japan. ","We recently launched two new Head & Shoulders variants in the US \u2013 Instant Fresh and Nourishing Care and are upgrading Head & Shoulders consumer message with a new campaign: Use daily to stay 100% flake free for life with Head & Shoulders scalp shield technology. Driven by these interventions in laundry, baby care, grooming, hair care and other categories, and by our investment in category-dedicated sales coverage, we are making sequential progress in our largest and most profitable market: the United States. ","The US business rebounded from a 2-point organic sales decline in Q1 to deliver 3 points of organic growth in Q2. The US improvement was despite product allocation driven by demand in excess of supply in two of our largest categories: Baby Care and Feminine Care, and despite a record light cough cold season impacting the Vicks brand. Sales are probably a point or so ahead of consumption for the October-December quarter but the progress is encouraging nonetheless. ","Our second largest market both sales and profits is China. Here Q2 organic sales were again down high single digits in line with the Q1 trend. We\u2019ve gotten behind in premium innovation which has been a contributor to our soft top line trends over the last several quarters. We're aggressively addressing this opportunity. David Taylor; Kathy Fish, our R&D leader, myself and several other members of our leadership team spent the last week in China. We\u2019re working with the team there and with the global business units to expand our offerings in the premium price tiers which are the fastest growing \u2013 to invest in trial consumer preferred products and to transform our go-to-market operations. ","We\u2019ve launched premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We\u2019re launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition, and we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide. We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. In Oral Care, we\u2019re launching Oral B Gum Care, a new super-premium gum repair line of Oral B toothpaste. The line includes a two-step paste and other single step paste variants. Consumer tests show the new line wining against top competition in the super premium tier. We\u2019re importing our best feminine care product Infinity to China with premium power toothbrushes and our best Braun razors. We\u2019re increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point of market entry sampling and trial across categories. We\u2019re strengthening our relationship and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing channels in the Chinese retail market. ","We\u2019re investing in coverage of these channels and are working to simplify, standardize, and strengthen our overall go-to-market approach. These moves will take time to fully implement and the go-to-market changes may actually result in pullbacks before progress but we\u2019re confident they will result in stronger growth over time. ","Stepping back then and looking at things on a macro level. The environment continues to be very challenging: slower market growth, steep foreign-exchange headwinds and a volatile political and policy environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity to focus our portfolio and to invest in superior consumer preferred brands and products. We\u2019re putting particular priority against the four largest categories: Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming, and against our two largest markets: the US and China. ","With that context as background, let me get into the details of the quarter we just completed as well as the outlook for the fiscal year. Two house-keeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we\u2019re reporting today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the beauty and battery businesses that we\u2019re in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In late October, we provided the restated 10-K for fiscal 2015 presenting the historical results on the same basis. ","Second, starting last quarter we\u2019re no longer consolidating the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries in our reported numbers. ","Organic sales were up 2% for the quarter versus the prior year. Each segment was at or ahead of year ago. As I mentioned previously, sales were slightly ahead of consumption. Organic sales in China and Russia were significantly lower versus last year, negatively impacting total company sales growth by more than a point. The category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another point of organic sales decline. These impacts were more than offset by progress in the United States and growth in Latin America. ","All-in sales were down 9%, including 8-point headwind from foreign-exchange and 3 points from the Venezuela de-consolidation and minor brand divestitures. Core gross margin and core operating margin each improved on both an all-in and ex-currency basis driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 210 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 290 basis points. ","Core SG&A costs improved 140 basis points, driven primarily by overhead cost reductions. We continue to invest in marketing, reinvest in non-working cost savings. Marketing expenditures were in total equal to year ago as a percentage of sales. Core operating margin was up 350 basis points versus the prior year behind 270 basis points of productivity savings. ","On a constant currency basis, our core operating margin was up 390 basis points. The core effective tax rate was 23.6%, up nearly a point versus last year. Core earnings per share were $1.04, up 9% versus the prior year quarter. This includes a 12 percentage point foreign-exchange headwind, approximately $300 million after-tax. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew 21%. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings-per-share were $1.12 for the quarter, up 37% versus the prior year. ","We generated $3.8 billion in free cash flow, yielding 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $2 billion in share repurchase. ","Moving to guidance. We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in-line to up low-single digits versus fiscal 2015. We\u2019ve been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Baby Care. We\u2019re launching a number of new consumer preferred premium innovations over the next few months in both developed and developing markets. We\u2019re investing in selling capabilities to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest-growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets. ","We've also invested in targeted price reductions to narrow consumer value gaps in several categories. All of these efforts along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last fiscal year give us confidence we will continue to grow organic sales in the second half. The level of growth could be impacted by our access to dollars for finished product import into Venezuela. About 60% of our Venezuelan business is imported. The sale of imported products from the importing subsidiary is still reported in our consolidated results. Failure to continue this business would result in up to a half point impact to top-line growth in the fiscal year. ","The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of the year. We now expect FX will have a 7 percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. Also the combined impact of the Venezuela de-consolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results. ","We\u2019re also maintaining constant currency core earnings-per-share guidance of mid to high singles with our internal outlook currently at the low end of this range. Given the magnitude of the foreign-exchange impact, I thought it might be helpful to again recount how FX impacts our earnings. I will use the example of the Argentinian peso. We\u2019ve been most pleased to see the early decisive approach of Argentina\u2019s new leadership and believe the actions they are taking will create long-term benefits for which we are well-positioned to participate. ","But the nearly 30% to 40% devaluation of the peso will significantly impact our reported earnings in three ways. First, transaction impacts increase the cost of non-peso denominated inputs. We import, as an example, Gillette blades and razors from Mexico into Argentina. Widening of the cross-weight between the two peso currencies increases the Argentina unit cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles which are denominated in dollars and imported into Argentina for the production of fabric care and hair care products have increased significantly. These transaction cost impacts affect all manufacturers, multinational or local whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated. We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing when local legal requirements and market realities allow it. Though there is a lag between the time when a currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution. ","The second impact is balance sheet revaluation. We need to revalue transaction-related payables and receivables balances at the end of each quarter. This includes the revaluation of balance as related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example, while razors produced in Mexico are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Argentina, our Argentinian business holds a Mexico peso-denominated payable on its books. At the end of every quarter, payables and receivables balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revaluing transactional balances flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings-per-share. ","Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Argentina that do not use US dollar as a functional currency are translated back to US dollars at the new exchange rate. Thus the Argentinian peso transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant, at about 70:50 and $20 million after-tax respectively or a total of $140 million after tax for the year. Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts total nearly $300 million after-tax in the December quarter, $700 million fiscal year to date and are forecast to be a $1 billion impact after-tax profit hurt over the course of the fiscal year. ","When we talk about foreign-exchange impacts, we\u2019re sometimes asked, why we don't simply hedge these away. It\u2019s a very valid question and something we look at internally and with a different set of outside eyes every year as we prepare our financial plan. ","There are three reasons we typically don't end up choosing to hedge. Up to two-thirds of our foreign-exchange losses and a significant amount of our forward exposure is in currencies that are either non-deliverable or are very difficult to hedge. The Argentinian peso, Venezuela bolivar and the Ukrainian hryvnia are three examples. ","Second, hedging is neither free nor cheap. Currency volatility in itself increases in significant ways this cost. So when you want it most, it becomes difficult to afford. ","The last shortfall of hedging as the answer is that it solves nothing longer term. It also does nothing to help restore the margin structure of the business. A hedge simply defers volatility. When the instrument expires, you have the same hit with the same margin impact you would have had, had you not hedged. While it takes time and there is a lag between the hurt and the help, we typically look to pricing, sizing, mix enhancement, sourcing choices and cost reduction to manage FX impacts. We\u2019ve historically recovered about two-thirds of FX impacts with pricing over time. We think this time given differential impacts for euro and yen functional currency competitors, it will be somewhat less than that. ","I said in our last call that we would invest where it was appropriate to do so. I said we would not cut smart investment to offset foreign-exchange impacts, which meant we could very well end up below the earnings-per-share guidance range. FX is a near-term reality that has gotten significantly worse. We\u2019re doing our best to offset FX impacts with productivity savings and pricing while continuing to make investments in brand equity, innovation, trial and value equations. We think we struck a reasonable balance of investment to improve the long term health of the business even though it requires we moderate our short-term earnings outlook, including foreign-exchange. ","We\u2019re reducing our core earnings per share guidance to a range of down 3% to 8% versus last year\u2019s core earnings-per-share of $3.76. This earnings-per-share guidance includes headwinds of 8 to 9 percentage points from the combined impacts of beauty deal and transition expenses. These are for the businesses moving out to merge with Coty, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower operating income and a higher -- non-operating income, excuse me, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings-per-share growth with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange. ","Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about 3 points higher than last year, roughly a four percentage point headwind on core earnings per share growth. The core tax rate in the back half of fiscal year \u2013 last fiscal year was below 19%. We expect a tax rate of closer to 24% in the back half of this fiscal. ","We continue to expect non-operating income will be a 2 to 3 percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth mainly impacting the fourth quarter. We had nearly $440 million of non-operating income gains last year with over $400 million coming in the second half, including $355 million in the fourth quarter. We expect modest non-operating income gains in the back half of this fiscal. ","With most of these impacts hitting in the back half, the core earnings per share growth headwind across Q3 and Q4 is roughly 13 percentage points or about $0.24 per share. FX adds another 7% or about $0.12 per share headwind in the back half. So while the midpoint of our new guidance range points to roughly a 15% core earnings-per-share reduction in the back half versus last year, or roughly flat excluding the tax and non-operating headwinds and up mid singles if we adjust for currency. ","Given very strong progress to date, as I said before, 101% in Q1, and 117% in Q2, we\u2019re increasing our free cash flow productivity target from 90% to 100% of earnings. We continue to expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and shares that will be exchanged during the third quarter in the Duracell transaction. In addition to the shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion and total $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchange and share repurchase. ","We now expect all-in GAAP earnings-per-share to be up approximately 42% at the center of our guidance range. Going forward we are committed to balanced top-line and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. We will continue to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We will defend our positions and we will invest behind brand trial, awareness programs and of course consumer preferred innovation. We will do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We\u2019ll smartly invest to accelerate top-line growth and we will continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders. David and I both look forward to talking with you at CAGNY about the plan and priorities to deliver balanced growth and value creation beyond this fiscal year. I will provide an update on our productivity progress and the significant opportunity that remains in front of us which can help fuel investment and growth. David will discuss our strategic choices, how we plan to sustainably improve top-line growth and the organization and culture changes we will make to accelerate our progress. ","That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which we posted on our website www.pg.com following the call. With that, I\u2019d be happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian ","Good morning. I wanted to focus a bit more on the topline results. Q2 was a solid sequential improvement despite some of the retail inventory cuts you mentioned in the release. And your full year sales guidance on org sales, looks like it\u2019s moving up given the all-in guidance is unchanged despite the greater FX pressure. So what's driving that more favorable expectation? Are the factors behind it more longer-term in nature, temporary to this year? And then also, can you help explain \u2013 if we look at Nielsen Scanner data, we haven't seen improvement in the US, Europe, or emerging markets -- so if you could help explain the dichotomy between the improved expectations but the lack of scanner data sales improvement, that\u2019s be helpful. And then last, last quarter you mentioned second half organic sales growth would likely be above Q2. Is that still the case?","Jon Moeller","So, first of all, Dara, we have maintained our organic sales growth guidance for the year, which is flat to low singles. So there\u2019s really no change in the overall outlook, which as you rightly say was for acceleration in Q2 and then further improvement in the back half of the year. As I mentioned, the extent of that improvement in the back half of the year is going to be potentially impacted by what happens with access to dollars for imports into Venezuela and it\u2019ll obviously be impacted by other things as well. But even with that we remain confident that we can continue to grow in the second half.","In terms of the businesses in the US and the comparisons to scanner data, as you know we pretty dramatically accelerated our growth in the US from minus 2% in the quarter before to plus 3% this quarter. I mentioned that there was about a point of sales that\u2019s ahead of consumption. That\u2019s on things like the ProShield razor that we shipped into the market but still even adjusting for that acceleration as we expected. It\u2019s getting increasingly difficult to look only at scanner data as a measure of a market\u2019s health or a business\u2019 health. That's particularly true in markets like China where a huge portion of the growth of the market is coming in the e-commerce channel which doesn't cross a scanner. And you have some of that same dynamic in the US. So, for example, the Shave Club sales depending on how they\u2019re executed may or may not cross a scanner. And I think that's part of the dichotomy. But generally if we look across several quarters to dampen out some of the short-term volatility and the noise, we continue to be pleased and encouraged by increasing strength in North American business and we expect it to grow going forward. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson, Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson ","Hi, first question just on housekeeping, I think you said China, your sales were down high single-digits. Do you have a sense for what the category growth was, just so we can compare that? and then second question, kind of more broadly on pricing, I guess, two components. Number one, in emerging markets where we continue to see currencies devalue like Russia, like Brazil, how far are you into your price increases, are you going to continue to take price increases to keep in line with inflation or sort of what\u2019s outlook there? And then second part of that, with regard to pricing in North America, it\u2019s surprising to me that there is still so much positive pricing kind of across the whole sector in light of the lower commodity prices. I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s just the reflection of a stronger US consumer or more innovation but if you can comment kind of broadly on your outlook about pricing in North America and whether you think the price increases you\u2019ve taken are sustainable?","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Wendy. Well first, China, it depends on the individual category but the market growth rates range roughly from, call it, 5% to 8%, so mid to high singles across the categories. And as I mentioned, we see significant opportunity remaining in China with those very effective growth rates albeit somewhat slower than they were two or three years ago. With the conversion from a manufacturing to a consumption-based economy, with the dramatic potential that exists as a result of larger family sizes from the possibility of two children versus just one and with the premiumization of the market which as I indicated admittedly we\u2019ve not been as agile as we need to be in exploiting. But really, as I mentioned I was there last week, I was there weeks before the Christmas holidays and I walked away with a tremendous sense of encouragement while acknowledging that we have work to do. ","In terms of pricing, the pricing dynamic should continue to be favorable contributor to topline growth as we move forward, even if all we do is take forward the price increases that have already been executed, they are not fully annualized yet. So that should continue to be a positive on the top line. The pricing calculus or algebra is fairly complicated. You really have to look at the combination of currencies, commodities and competition to determine a course of action going forward in any individual product category or market. And the sum of those three things is very different depending on what market you're in, as influenced by both currencies and by competition. In general the companies in our industry continue to price at some level for foreign-exchange. I mentioned in our prepared remarks that we expect our ability to price to be somewhat lower than it has been historically and we will make up for that over time with productivity and other savings. ","And in the US, first of all, the commodity impacts aren\u2019t as significant as you would assume, just looking at the headlines on oil prices, for example. If you look at everything from diesel to resin to other inputs that are derived from the petro-complex, while the pricing benefit or cost reduction has occurred, it is not anywhere near the level yet of the crude price reductions. So I think that's a potential source of disconnect as people think about this. Generally we\u2019re taking pricing behind very strong product innovation. We\u2019re looking to improve the strength of our overall value equations, the combination of pricing, product, performance, consumer usage, experience, static [ph] and done in that way I think that continues to be a contributor to growth and value creation. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman, Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman ","I\u2019ve got a question on SG&A and reinvestment level. So we sort of keep track of the moving piece of your share each quarter and it looks like reinvestment in the business decelerated a bit in the second quarter. And then also to tie to your full year outlook, SG&A probably needs to go up in the back half. So can you just tell me if that\u2019s sort of on the right track and if it\u2019s going up, what the specific areas of reinvestment will be versus the pace of the overhead take-out?","Jon Moeller","So we expect, for example, our media spending to be up double-digits in the second half versus year ago. So as reinvestment as compared to the prior year that will definitely be increasing. As we look at those choices, we\u2019re obviously not encumbered by the math. We\u2019re looking at the value creation potential that exists behind those investments in both the short and importantly mid and longer-term and we will invest where we have opportunities to do so. So I think that, you should think of the level of investment, reinvestment sequentially increasing as we go forward. I think, I know that will be the case this fiscal year. I expect that will be the case next fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher, JPMorgan.","John Faucher ","Thanks. Just to follow up on that. Jon, it seems as though you\u2019ve delivered upside on the sort of FX neutral earnings growth year-to-date, particularly today you\u2019re going to the low end of the range. Is that because of some of the incremental investments you are talking about? Is that ad spend sort of incremental to what you were thinking before? And then separately -- and thanks for the color on the FX piece \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty wide range if we look at that over the balance of the year in terms of the FX impact, it\u2019s probably something in the neighborhood of like $0.20. And so I guess I'm just wondering what drives those differences in outcomes from an FX standpoint because, just so we understand where we need to go within that range?","Jon Moeller","In terms of over-delivering and then maintaining the constant currency guidance, yes that definitely is reflective of additional investment, I mentioned in our prepared remarks that in North America, for example, we\u2019ve increased our budgets by about 100 basis points since the start of the year, most of that occurring relatively recently, that\u2019s driven both by our encouragement from a response standpoint to the spending that we have in the market and the acceleration of growth particularly in the US. And so yes, your interpretation is correct in terms of the various moving pieces. The guidance range is really reflective of what the underlying constant currency range of outcomes could be and then we just apply the current FX math on top of that. And there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 we\u2019re operating in a more volatile environment than we ever have, and I think our range is reflective of that reality as it should be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara ","Hey thanks, Jon, make you rehash this a little bit but I guess I'm not -- I'm not totally understanding why the back half EBIT would decline. So I think I understand the below the line impact of tax rate and other. But it looks like FX probably gets less of that in the back half of the year. So I think you said that, right, yet your guidance range really implies a deceleration in EBIT. So and a reasonably substantial one from this past quarter. So I guess, correct me if that's wrong but do you guys expect the gross margin acceleration to slow in the back half of the year, maybe I guess what might I be missing?","Jon Moeller","Some of those impacts -- that 8 to 9 point impact of things like Venezuela deconsolidation and the beauty transition costs and the non-operating income difference are all in the EBIT line. So that\u2019s a significant driver of lower EBIT comparisons second half versus first half. As I mentioned, most of those hit the second half disproportionately. In terms of currency, there is some let up but not a lot in the back half. And I expect our margin progress to continue to be reasonably strong, certainly constant currency on both gross and operating. So really the comparison is most dramatically driven by FX and by things like the Venezuela deconsolidation, the transition costs associated with the beauty business that are not in discontinued operations. For example, if we have employees in our global business service organization that are working to stand up the new company in terms of building the systems that are required etc. those are employees that are going to remain with Procter & Gamble and therefore their costs are not in discontinued operations, they are in continuing operations. And then as I mentioned, the divestiture gain in non-op is a big driver as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz ","A couple of questions, just a housekeeping one. Do you still think Duracell is going to close roughly in any day now and is Coty still set to close July, August? And then my real question is, when do you guys \u2013 when does market share really start to matter, because I know you\u2019ve kind of sort of downplayed it and said, we\u2019re about expanding categories and protecting the structural integrity of our categories but it just seems that some of the share decline, as some others mentioned, especially some of the emerging markets are a pretty significant. So can you just tell me like, if you\u2019re going to have a point in time where the focus is going to shift, and you\u2019re going to start focusing on market share again and then just in a quarter what percentage of the business is gaining market share?","Jon Moeller","Duracell, as I mentioned earlier should close this quarter. The exact date will depend on work that still needs to occur but that's on track. Coty is currently scheduled to close as well on the timing that we initially indicated, which should be in the back half of the calendar year, so no changes on either of those, both progressing towards the desired end points that we would hope. ","In terms of market share, our objective is balanced growth and value creation with the growth objective being over time at to slightly ahead of markets. So market share does matter but particularly in a time when we need to restore structural economics and in response to currency moves we can get ourselves in big trouble, as that becomes the driving metric. And so as we\u2019ve said we\u2019re prepared to lose some share in two situations. One is where we\u2019re restoring our structural economic attractiveness and having a higher market share with a negative gross margin isn\u2019t helpful to anyone. And also where we are doing some of portfolio cleanup that I mentioned on the core categories but we will be in a much better position longer term from both the growth and value creation standpoint if we can focus on the parts of our portfolio that are really working for us. So if you look at the percentage of business that is holding our growing share, it\u2019s about 45% globally currently, we would expect that to be higher going forward. In the US where we are further ahead in the strengthening of our portfolio et cetera, we\u2019ve got about 60% of business holding in our growing share. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan, Stifel Nicolaus.","Mark Astrachan ","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to go back to China, Jon. So, does the sales growth guidance for the back half of the year anticipate an improvement in current trends? And then related to that, given the time that you talked about being in the market, do you think it's realistic you can be competitive in all the categories in which you compete today? ","Jon Moeller","The current guidance does an improvement in China in the back half and that should be very doable just based on the math alone. In other words, the annualization of some of the changes that we made in our go to market and inventory levels in the back half of last year. So we do expect that will improve and again as I said our view on China is an opportunistic one, not a pessimistic one. We really think that there is significant continued opportunity there both top and bottom line. And I think we picked the categories that we\u2019re going to compete in, in the new portfolio based on our view of our capability to be more than competitive to win. These are categories that we have won in, we\u2019re global leaders in almost every single one, I think seven out of 10, and we are among the leaders in the balance. There is a margin structure that allows for a significant investment and growth in each of these businesses. These are higher margin businesses and they are businesses that importantly leverage our core capabilities as a company. So they have been deliberately chosen for success. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Steve Powers ","Thanks, Jon. So, I guess on the one hand, I think we're all very pleased with the return to positive organic growth, especially alongside the strong cash productivity and margin progression that you called out. And then on the other hand, volumes were still down 2%. I guess 1%, if I exclude the businesses you've chosen to exit. But negative essentially across the whole business nonetheless. And market share, sounds like it was down in aggregate. So I guess just some further comments there would be helpful in terms of how and when you're likely to come out of this negative volume phase? Because if I go back over the last 15 years or so, we're sort of in this anomalous period where last year and sounds like this year we're in negative volume territory. The only time that's ever happened was the financial crisis. So I guess again, how and when can we sort of inflect positive on that key volume number? ","Jon Moeller","So the two drivers of the volume reduction, one, as you indicated there is a portfolio cleanup within the core categories that are still reported within continuing operations and as you rightly indicated, that\u2019s had about a point worth of impact. And the other is the market reaction from a consumption standpoint and in some cases the share price evolution, as we take pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts in large devaluation markets. So if you take Russia, or the Ukraine as an example, where devaluation has been 70%, 80%, 110%, we have negative gross margins, we need to price over time as well as do everything we can from a savings standpoint to restore those margins at least to a positive levels, so the growth is meaningful. And during that process, both at a market level, the markets tend to contract in response to higher price points and sometimes from a share standpoint and Russia and Ukraine are good examples where we\u2019re competing against strong European competitors, in other case, Russia, Japanese competitors as well, and sometimes there's a modest share impact that comes with the pricing that we deem necessary to take. ","We are not prepared to lose share indefinitely. Our history in this area is that it takes kind of six to nine months to work our way through this. Some of the pricing that we\u2019ve taken has been recent because a lot of the devaluation has been recent. So I don't -- I haven't actually looked at it quarter by quarter to see what\u2019s the quarter where volume will re-inflect positive. We\u2019ll have to work our way through this pricing. I don't believe -- go back to the comments on market share, we fully intend to grow at market growth rates or slightly ahead of market growth rates over longer periods of time, that requires volume growth. I mentioned market is growing 3 percent-nish, we\u2019re not going to be able to take 3% pricing indefinitely, nor is that our intent in any way. So we will -- also we\u2019re not in markets where competitors don\u2019t respond from a pricing standpoint. Remember we \u2013 because we are the market leaders typically have to lead or nothing happens, so we\u2019re exposed for that period of time and competitors can take six to nine months sometimes before they respond or they cannot respond at all. And to cases where they don\u2019t respond to the level that are necessarily to maintain are value equation comparisons or where they don\u2019t price at all, we will reduce price. We\u2019re not going to be un-competitive, we\u2019re not going to lose share on a sustained basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi ","Just two quick questions. Jon, can you maybe provide just a quick bridge on the volume? When you talk about the US going positive and helping us reconcile how you got to the total consolidated number, just so we get a geographic viewpoint. And then the bigger question is, as you kind of push responsibility closer to those 10 business leaders, how long does that take to really start affecting business decisions and on the ground results? I'm trying to get a sense of what the time lag typically you would expect after making a move like that. ","Jon Moeller","Thanks for the bigger picture question, Nik. It\u2019s actually something we will spend some time talking about at CAGNY. It\u2019s interesting, the market on a relative inflection point standpoint, that\u2019s growing the strongest which is the US, is one where these changes were made first. They were made about year ago, where basically in addition to the 10 categories and their ability to operate somewhat independently, we\u2019ve sectorized our sales force and so we\u2019re going end to end from GBU all the way through to customer with dedicated sales support. We\u2019re not moving people as rapidly across categories. The GBUs have full decision rights on the amount of resources that are supporting their business from a go to market operation standpoint, which has led to some choices quite frankly to increase coverage in some channels, it\u2019s led to choices to hire mid-career talent that has experience in a category that extends beyond the experience of our current employees. So it\u2019s having a dramatic impact and every change has a slightly different timeline in terms of when it could reflect in the business results. But I think we can \u2013 I think we\u2019re making good progress in this area. I think we have more to do. Again we will talk about that at CAGNY, and I don't think it takes a long period of time to make a difference.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante, Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante ","Hi, good morning everyone. Going back to Nik's questions, which I don't think -- at least I didn't hear the response, is that could you break out geographically the growth at, say, in emerging markets between -- also between volume and pricing? Secondly, it is true that volume has been negative for four quarters in a row. To what extent you feel that this has been problems in the way you execute pricing as it happened in Russia and Mexico and whether those execution issues have been resolved? My understanding is that you have removed some of the heads of China and Latin America. All these changes are over. Shall we expect pricing to be less disruptive going forward? ","Jon Moeller","First, sorry, I did miss the first part of Nik\u2019s question, thanks for bringing that back. The relationship of organic volume to organic sales in the October-December quarter, developed markets organic volume was plus 2, organic sales were plus 3. If you look at developing, organic volume was minus 6, organic sales were flat versus year ago. If you look at those comparisons, they are indicative of exactly what I have said a couple times in this call in terms of what\u2019s driving the volume reduction is pricing in developing markets to offset FX where you don't have as much of an FX impact. For instance in the developed markets our volumes grew at 2% in the quarter. ","In terms of \u2013 you mentioned Mexico as an example, we actually had a very good quarter in Mexico. The changes that we\u2019ve made there, we\u2019re very pleased with. Organic sales were up 4% in Mexico in the quarter and remember I talked about the tissue towel impact \u2013 the tissue change in the portfolio which has negatively impacted organic sales, that\u2019s in Mexico. Excluding that, Mexico organic sales were up 8% in the quarter and volume was up as well. So again there is a bit of noise as we work through the combination of the portfolio and foreign-exchange. But we expect volume will grow as we go forward and share will also be something that becomes increasingly attainable. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello ","First question is on Brazil. I apologize if I missed this, but what were the Brazilian sales in the quarter? I think last quarter was down 12%. You were hoping for a little bit of bounce back this quarter. Secondly, on commodities, Jon, you mentioned earlier that you're not seeing the benefit that some would think you would given the move in oil but obviously it is a positive for you this year. So what kind of boost do you see from commodities to earnings this fiscal year? ","Jon Moeller","Thanks Joe. Brazil, for the quarter organic sales were up 11%, that compares to minus 12% the prior quarter, I think that again is another good example of the volatility that\u2019s going to occur here as we get the right pricing set in the market and as well our ability to pull that through and generate growth on a sustainable basis. So again Brazil was up 11% on the quarter.","In terms of commodities, look that as a single area, so the reduction of input costs, that impact is about $500 million on the fiscal year. Some of that we anticipated going into the year for us but that\u2019s the amount. I would argue that in total, in other words, inclusive of consumption impacts in oil producing countries where there has been massive disruption and instability, if you think about markets like Saudi Arabia, markets like certainly Venezuela, I would say that the net impact in our P&L is likely neutral negative but the pure cost impact is $500 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell ","Jon, I just wanted to follow-up, since you had highlighted kind of the changes made both in Mexico and India and the not worse gaining sales, if they're not worth anything. I think you said that costs about 1 point to organic growth in the quarter. If that's right, is that the expected impact for the next two, three quarters and is this kind of a program that may accelerate as we move into fiscal \u201817? ","Jon Moeller","The amount is the correct amount, you are right, it was about a point in the quarter. We would expect \u2013 we really started this work in terms of execution in July-September, maybe some in the latter part of last fiscal year, so we would expect this to continue through the next couple quarters but then it should dissipate going forward. There may be a few additional choices we need to make but in general you will see it for the next couple of quarters and then it should start to dissipate.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj ","Hey, guys, thanks for fitting me into the call. Believe it or not, I still have a few questions. One is just go deeper on volumes. Look, your compares clearly get easier over the next couple quarters, so that should certainly bode well. But can you elaborate a little bit more and perhaps even quantify the inventory management change by retailers and the trade term change that you mentioned in the press release, which is mentioned as a negative. Particularly in the context of what you said on your prepared remarks, which is that sales being slightly ahead of consumption. So give us a sense of the ongoing effects of those if you could? Number one. ","Number two is on your FX kind of multiplier between the top-line and the bottom-line impact, why did it change so dramatically versus your \u201816 guidance? So what I mean is that in July, your FX impact was going to be negative 4% to 5% top line, negative 3% to 4% bottom line, so kind of a less than 1 ratio. But now it's a negative 7% on top line, negative 10% on the bottom line, so very quickly shifting to a greater than 1 ratio, despite your efforts to localize more, et cetera. So is that all Argentina devaluation? Or is there some forecasting math that I'm not getting or can you give us a sense of how your business is structured or levered differently than we would expect it, because it's big switch in a short period of time? And then third question is more in terms of running these conference calls. Should we infer that the decision was made, because I know you guys were thinking about this, that your CEO will not be on these quarterly calls and will only be at things like CAGNY and the annual calls like AG was doing? Or are you still in the deciding mode? Thanks for the two questions. ","Jon Moeller","On the FX multiplier, as you can imagine the different currencies that have \u2013 we have no ability to forecast which currencies are going to move and how much they are going to move. And top and bottom line relationship between currency movements is very different depending on the market. It depends on how the markets source, it depends on the balance sheet of the market, I mentioned balance sheet revaluations, so for example, in Argentina we\u2019ve talked about the balance sheet revaluation that occurred there, so it\u2019s really a function of what actually is happening in the marketplace country by country, how we source to markets and what the balance sheet exposure is in different markets. So I guess I am saying we don't really have a good ability to forecast exactly what the currency impact is going to be on either the top or bottom line and frankly we spend very little time thinking about the relationship between the two. ","In terms of the comments on trade inventory reduction, that is largely a China dynamic. I mentioned in prior calls that our inventory levels were too high particularly in the wholesale channel in China, and as a result our pricing was too low which was driving a bit of a distortion and difficulty for our distributors. And so we\u2019ve made some choices to address that and that has a short-term volume impact. That\u2019s really what that comment was designed to indicate. ","Relative to senior executive engagement with the investment community, we intend to be fully engaged with the investment community through a combination of quarterly conference calls, investment conferences, meetings here in Cincinnati. Dave will be on the road frequently as well interacting with the investment community. So again our strategy is one of very high engagement. ","End of Q&A","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17487":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) F3Q 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 23, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - CFO","Analysts","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Michael Stieb - Credit Suisse","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Steve Powers - UBS","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Caroline Levy - CLSA","","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.","\"Organic\" refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings.","Any measure described as \"core\" refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, and good morning. Our January-March results came in as we had expected, keeping us on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives. All-in sales were unchanged, versus the prior year, including a three point headwind from foreign exchange.","Organic sales grew more than 3% in a very challenging macro environment, with significant market level events in places like Venezuela, Argentina and the Ukraine, declining levels of market growth in both the developed and developing world and weather-related issues in North America. Organic sales were at or above prior year levels in each of our five reporting segments.","Organic sales growth was driven by strong organic volume growth of 3%. Volume was at or above prior year levels in each of our five reporting segments. Pricing added one point to sales growth and mix reduced sales growth by one point. Fiscal year-to-date, we deliver between 3% and 4% organic sales growth, leaving us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year.","March quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.90. All-in earnings per share include approximately $0.04 per share of non-core restructuring charges, and $0.10 per share of non-core balance sheet revaluation impacts resulting from foreign exchange policy changes in Venezuela.","Core gross margin declined 110 basis points, cost savings of 200 basis points, pricing and volume leverage were offset by product category and geographic mix of 150 basis points, foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points and higher commodity costs.","Core SG&A improved 130 basis points driven by marketing efficiencies and overhead productivity savings. Importantly therefore, core operating margin increased 20 basis points. Core earnings per share grew 5% to $1.4, leaving us on track to deliver 3% to 5% core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Foreign exchange was at $0.12 per share headwind for the company on the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, core earnings per share grew 17%.","The effective tax rate on core earnings was about 20%. Tax accounted for roughly $0.03 of earnings per share benefit on the quarter versus the prior year. We generated $3.2 billion in free cash flow, achieving 119% free cash flow productivity, and remaining on track to deliver free cash flow productivity of about 90% for the fiscal year.","As planned, we returned to 1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends. We also announced a 7% increase in our dividend. P&G has now been paying a dividend for 124 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890. This is the 58th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend.","We repurchased $1.5 billion in stock bringing year-to-date share repurchase to 5.5 billion. Stepping back, we are satisfied with our top line growth, particularly against the difficult macro backdrop. Constant currency earnings progress was very strong. We're reliably converting earnings to cash, and are building on a strong track record of cash returned to shareholders.","As we move forward, value creation for consumers and shareowners remains our top priority. Operating TSR is our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level, requiring sales growth, margin progress and strong cash flow productivity. Operating TSR drives focus on core brands and businesses, our leading, most profitable categories, and leading, most profitable markets.","Our strongest brands and business units and total company positions are in the U.S. We need to continue to ensure our home market stays strong and growing. The actions we've taken over the past two years to restore consumer value, expand our vertical product portfolios and horizontal regimens, and lead innovation have enabled us to restore value creating share growth in more parts of the business.","We still have a lot more work to do, and the competitive environment is intense, which leads to choppy results on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we're making steady progress.","We'll continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets, with a focus on the categories and countries with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. This is where the world's babies will be born, and where more new households will be formed. Developing markets will continue to be a significant growth driver for our company this year and for years to come.","We'll continue to focus the company's portfolio allocating resources to businesses where we can create value. Over the past six years, we exited businesses that have accounted for over $6 billion in sales, including coffee, pharmaceuticals, snacks, kitchen appliances and water purification. Last quarter, we announced our exit from the bleach business. Two weeks ago, we announced our plan to exit the pet food business. Mars will buy our business in the Americas and several other countries. We expect to sell the European business to a different buyer.","The $2.9 billion purchase price Mars has agreed to pay for the nine European business represents a 1.8 times multiple of sales and an 18X multiple of EBITDA on an average of the past two year's sales and profits for the global pet food business.","We'll begin the process of selecting a buyer for the European market in May; early interest in this asset is strong. We'll continue to exit businesses where we determine that potential buyers with difficult capability sets can create more value than ourselves.","Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we're continuing to drive productivity and cost savings. We made solid progress over the last fiscal year and a half. We have strong productivity plans for fiscal 2014, and we're accelerating some 2015 savings into 2014.","Versus a target run rate of $1.2 billion, we are now forecasting about $1.6 billion of cost of goods productivity savings this fiscal year across materials, logistics and manufacturing expense. Versus a going-in target of 5%, we expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We're up more than 7% fiscal year-to-date.","At the CAGNY conference, we announced the complete redesign of our end-to-end supply chain in North America. We operated 35 manufacturing facilities in North America today, only six of which are multi-business or multi-category. We're consolidating operations into multi-category sites, located closer to the customers and consumers we serve, allowing us to respond quickly to their needs and provide better service at the best possible cost.","We're examining the potential for similar improvements in Europe. At the same time, we are converting to common manufacturing and technology platforms for faster innovation, qualification and expansion. We are designing supply systems to allow for more online product differentiation and customization.","We're also transforming our distribution operations, consolidating customer shipping and product customization operations into fewer distribution centers, which are strategically located closer to key customers and key population centers, enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper.","All of this would drive step change improvement and responsiveness, reducing out of stocks, taking down inventory and lowering cost. It leverages the scale and scope of our production and distribution network in a way we've never done before.","Savings from this transformation will accrue over three to four years, and should be in the range of $200 million to $300 million annually, which will be incremental to the $6 billion of cost of good savings we previously communicated. We expect additional top and bottom-line benefits from improved service levels.","Turning to overhead, we have exceeded our 2014 fiscal year non-manufacturing enrollment reduction goals, and have accelerated over a thousand role reductions originally planned for fiscal 2015 into 2014. Through March, we're down 8000 roles or 13%. Our strict objective is to get substantially to our end of 2015 objectives by the end of 2014. This would put us close to, or within, the 16% to 22% reduction goal we've established one to two years ahead of target.","Underpinning this progress are some important and fundamental changes in our organization structure and focus. We've organized into four industry-based sectors or global business units. The businesses in each sector are focused on common consumer benefits and needs. They share common technologies. They partner with common customers and common trade channels, and they face common competitors.","These sectors or global business units are big enough for scale and small enough to stay in touch with consumers and markets and move with the agility and flexibility to consistently grow value.","We've made a significant clarification in roles and announced a significant de-duplication of effort between the GBUs and the go-to-market operations. GBUs will create design, manufacture and market our brands and products. They will be the focus of brand building at the global, regional and local levels. Brand franchise building resources will be in the GBUs.","We've changed the name of our go-to-market organizations from MDO to SMO, Sales and Market Operations. This is more than a name change; it clarifies the work SMOs need to do in the work they do best, superior, effective and efficient, selling, distribution, shelving, pricing execution and merchandizing; every day, every week and every store.","Selling resources will be concentrated in the SMOs. We're aggregating the SMOs to be more logically focused on the consumers, channels, customers and markets we serve. We're merging western, central and eastern Europe into one European organization. We're merging India, the Middle East and Africa into one IMEA region. We're more fully integrating Greater China, ASEAN, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Korea into one Asia SMO region over the next year. Within the SMOs, we'll aggregate countries at a higher level, reducing the number of geographic country clusters to about 25, a 20% reduction versus today. And back in the GBUs, we're moving from four disaggregated brand building functions; design, consumer and market understanding, communications and marketing into one integrated brand building or brand management organization.","We have embedded resources that are required to win in the GBUs and SMOs, reducing the size of the standalone support functions, following those resources to work and outsourcing more of their activities.","The changes I just described are significant. They will reduce interfaces and transaction costs, clarify who is accountable for what, de-duplicate effort and simplify operations. These changes will enable us to operate with more agility and speed, to operate with clear accountability and effectiveness, and to operate at a lower cost that will also enable further enrollment reduction.","Moving next to marketing expense, we continue to drive marketing effectiveness and productivity through an optimized media mix with more digital mobile search and social presence, improved message clarity and greater non-advertising marketing efficiency. We expect marketing spending to come in below prior year levels, due to productivity improvements in non-working marketing and advertising cost. Importantly, the overall effectiveness and the consumer impact over advertising spending will be well ahead of the prior year.","While acknowledging the progress I've just described across cost of goods, overhead and marketing, you maybe asking yourself \"Where have all the savings gone?\" This year, a disproportionate number of them have gone to offset FX. We have leading positions in some of the markets where currencies have soften the most, Japan, Venezuela, Ukraine, Russia and Turkey.","As I mentioned earlier, January to March earnings per share would be 17% ahead of a year ago on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, constant currency core earnings per share is up 11%. Partially as a result of devaluation or the same significant wage inflation in developing markets, which we also need to offset, and we're making targeted investments and innovation and then selling covers drive growth.","The majority of the offset though has been FX, which hopefully will annualize and will be partially offset by pricing. As more savings come online and we see several more years of significant opportunity, we will get a greater percent reinvested in growth or brought to the bottom line. We're committed to make productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage.","We're equally committed to maintaining innovation leadership in our industry. Innovation and productivity are the two most powerful and sustainable ways we can drive value creation for consumers and shareholders. The IRI Pacesetter results for calendar year 2013 demonstrate our commitment to leading innovation. P&G launched seven of the top 10 non-food U.S. consumer product innovations in 2013 with Tide Pods topping the list. In addition, six P&G innovations were included in their list of rising stars.","Innovation is creating value on building cumulative advantage in the fabric and home care sector. Our breakthrough of proprietary three chamber unit, those laundry technology launched as Tide Pods, Ariel Pods and Gain Flings has reset that the life of consumer usage experience, product performance and convenience store. Unit-dose detergents are currently available in over 20 markets around the world, and have generated well over $1 billion in retail sales.","The recent launch, Gain Flings is going extremely well, reaching nearly a 3% value share in the U.S. laundry category in just two months. Unit-dose now represents 11% of category sales of which we have an 80% share. The balance of the fabric care innovation bundle that we launched in North America in February is also off to a good start. And so, our execution of Tide Simply Clean and Fresh has gone very well.","Total pricing share was up more than half a point over the past three-month period, an indication that so far Tide Simply Clean and Fresh is attracting incremental users to the brand. Improved scents and new sizes of Downy Unstoppables and Gain Fireworks in Wash Scent Beads have helped accelerate growth in this new product segment.","The broad range of baby care innovations launched in the U.S., last fall, continue to deliver excellent results. Nearly every diaper across all sizes and price tiers was improved to deliver better absorbency, comfort or design. Overall, P&G U.S. baby care share was up two points with share growing in 90% of retail customer. This has led to our largest market share in the past 20 years, enabling us to retake market leadership from Kimberly-Clark. The extension of the Swagger's form in the sizes four and five has been particularly successful. Swagger share is up three points to a 10% value share of the U.S. diaper category.","At the CAGNY conference in February, we announced we will be launching two new innovations in blades and razors. The first was the launch of Gillette BODY, which is moving well. The second and more significant innovation will be announced next Tuesday, April 29th. Men have told us they prefer the new innovation two to one versus the best selling razor in the world. More information will be coming to you soon on how you can watch the unveiling of our newest male shaving system.","Product innovations like the one I've just described at laundry, baby care and grooming are critical to drive in strong sustainable top line momentum and delivering superior consumer value. We're also working to improve execution and operating discipline. We're seeing this improvement play out in the supply chain, in the execution of innovation launches in stores, and then the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs. We are performing better, but there is still more to do. Operating discipline and execution have always been and must continue to be a core capability for Procter & Gamble.","We believe that the focus we are bringing to these four areas; operating TSR, productivity, innovation, operational excellence, along with targeted reinvestment will enable us to continue to improve results even as it work to address several remaining opportunities.","We remain on track to deliver our 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line and cash. We're maintaining organic sales growth range of 3% to 4%. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of two to three points, which leads to all-in sales growth of approximately 1% for the fiscal year.","We're maintaining our forecast for bottom line core earnings per share growth of 3% to 5%, offsetting stronger headwinds from foreign exchange and softer market growth rates with productivity savings. We currently expect foreign exchange to be roughly nine point headwind to core earnings per share growth. As a result, our guidance translates to constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 14%.","Recall that with the planned sale of the pet care business, we are restating pet care earnings from continuing operations to discontinued operations. This will reduce core earnings per share by approximately $0.03 and $0.04 per share for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 respectively. All-in earnings per share growth remain the same.","We have included a table in the press release this morning, which provides an estimate of the quarterly restatements. Please pay attention to this when you adjust your models as the impacts vary across quarters. On an all-in GAAP basis we now expect earnings per share to grow approximately 1% to 4%. This range reflects the non-core impacts from foreign exchange policy changes in Venezuela, approximately $0.15 of non-core restructuring cost in fiscal year 2014, and the restatement of pet care earnings into discontinued operations on both the current and prior fiscal years.","The fourth quarter earnings growth that's implied within our guidance is driven by a combination of operating growth, driven by productivity savings and devaluation-related pricing, a low tax rate of about 21% on core earnings and $0.03 to $0.04 of small brand divestiture gains.","We expect to deliver another year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase of about $6 billion. This comes to the assumptions included in our guidance; we want to continue to be very transparent about some key items that are not included. The guidance that we're confirming today is based on last week's FX spot rates. Further currency weakness is not anticipated within our guidance range.","We continue to monitor and invest on several markets, the Middle East for example, and Ukraine, Venezuela and price controls access to dollars for imported products and devaluation present risks as do import restrictions and price controls in Argentina. Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth rates.","Our year-to-date results are in line with what we expect to deliver, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year and make progress towards our long-term objectives. We continue to operate in a volatile environment with uncertainty in foreign exchange, deceleration in market growth rates and a rapidly developing policy environment. Against this backdrop, we have maintained a top line growth, and improved constant currency operating earnings growth.","We launched a strong round of innovation in the third quarter and have significant new innovation coming in the fourth quarter, which will be complemented by further savings from productivity. We're making targeted investments in our core business, most promising and developing markets and biggest innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving productivity and cost savings. Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which will be posted in our website www.pg.com following the call.","I'll be happy now to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan","Yes. Thank you, good morning. Jon, as we look at the cost savings, particularly on the gross margin line, they're not really flowing through at this point. Obviously some of that is the big transactional impact, but you have also got this very big mix impact, which is really offsetting a lot of the work you're doing there. How should we think about that over the next couple of years? And is this going to continue to be a massive drag? Or is it -- should it dissipate as you get more local manufacturing in place? And just give us a little bit of an update there. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So, there are two things as you rightly pointed, John, and as we talked about in prepared remarks that are offsetting the cost savings on the gross margin line, and one is FX, which is significant. Hopefully that annualizes, and as I mentioned we're committed to price we are legally allowed to help mitigate that effect as well. So, hopefully that portion of the dynamic dampens going forward.","The other dynamic as you rightly point out is a mix dynamic, which has two components. One is -- two primary components. One is the category component. In the quarter, we just completed -- we had a great quarter of growth, both volume and sales in our home care segment, which is very profitable overall, but which does have lower gross margins than the balance of the business. By contrast, we had relatively soft quarters in our healthcare business and our grooming business, which are higher gross margin. I look at that as one quarter's impact. I don't think that sustains itself going forward. Some quarters, it will be positive; some quarters, it will be negative.","The second component of that is the geographic component made up as you all know by faster growth in developing markets, which have lower gross margin. That impact will continue to exist. I don't see a scenario in the near-term where developed markets grow faster than developing markets. We will make progress on the margin in developing markets as manufacturing is localized as we build scale, but it's going to continue to be a component of drag.","Do I think we can get to a place where this mix dynamic is only partially offsetting cost saving such that we're growing gross margin? Absolutely, and I expect that absent -- other big foreign exchange event, that would characterize the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning.","Jon Moeller","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I was hoping you could discuss the sustainability of the gap between organic sales growth of 3% or 4% this year, and the local FX, core EPS growth of 12% to 14% particularly with a negative geographic gross margin mix impact. Do you think that gap is sustainable as you look out the next year in longer term?","Then, just on a related note, I know you are not going to obviously give guidance on EPS next year, but given as a company that's in difficulty hitting the initial EPS targets over the last few years, I'm just wondering if conceptually there might be more of a need to bake in some conservatism as you set guidance going forward, particularly given the royalty, it's more volatile and obviously there had been a lot of external issues that have pressured results and could going forward, and if that's part of your thought process as you look to next year's guidance?","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Dara. In terms of the spread between organic sales growth and constant currency earnings per share growth, for successful in delivering basically the $2 billion of savings per year that are implied in our $10 billion five year goal; that by itself is 11 points of earnings per share benefit. You add that to 3% to 4% organic sales growth and you're in the ballpark of the spread that we are talking about for this fiscal year. We have no intention of letting up our cost savings and productivity efforts and see several years of significant savings ahead of us. So, I think that relationship is representative of the work that's going on. How much of it actually gets to the all-in bottom line numbers will be a function of FX, and also a function of some degree of reinvestment is good, opportunities present themselves.","In terms of philosophy on guidance, obviously we haven't spent a lot of time focusing on next year yet, but in general what we are going to try to continue to do is be incredibly transparent or as transparent as we can. If you look at the year that we just went through, the one reduction in guidance we made midway through the year was due to currency in Venezuela. The way we handled that in the initial forecast of the year was by communicating that we didn't have anything assumed in the numbers. We didn't know when or what the devaluation was going to be. We wanted to provide full transparency, so that you and other could in essence use your own understanding and knowledge to come to a form point of view what you thought the result was going to be.","At minimum, we will continue to be very transparent, tell you what's in, tell you what's not in, and generally we like making our goals. We don't like not making them, and that will be reflected in our approach as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi Research","Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about the comment that marketing efficiencies helped sort of generate all that SG&A leverage? How much of that was a shift from advertising to promotion? How much of that is just part of AGs long-term, \"Hey, we want to lower advertising by 100 basis points?\" Is there a risk that in some of these categories given how competitive the market is; is there a risk you are underinvesting or maybe just comment on all of that. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Sure, Wendy. So, the SG&A offset to gross margin, which resulted in operating margin accretion is driven by both overhead productivity and marketing effectiveness and efficiency improvements. Within marketing effectiveness and efficiency, a significant portion of that is a reduction in non-working dollars, tighter operations, if you will, and the design and creation of marketing programs. And another big portion of it is the work I mentioned to get to more effectively target consumers through new capabilities that are available to use new forms of media and consumer engagement to generate more effective communication, as well as more efficient communication with our targeted consumers.","So, it's really all of that. As I tried to say in the prepared remarks, we are very focused on assuring that the overall impact of our advertising program, the number of consumers that we are reaching, the quality of that interaction grows, does not decline. I think there is -- we are at a point where simply looking at dollars, it's just not representative of the strength of a marketing program in a rapidly changing marketing landscape.","We do -- to your question of underinvesting; that is something that we look at very carefully. There have been some categories this year, where we have reduced spending as the years going on, and there have been some categories where we have increased spending as the year going on. We are not going to underinvest, but we are going to be effective and efficient in our investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Great, thank you. Good morning, everybody. So, a couple of questions; first one is, can you just break down the growth in emerging markets versus developed markets? And then I know we really talked about it, but can you talk a little bit about family care, because I think they are like your second and third largest businesses in the U.S., and clearly that slowed quite a bit. I know you cited some competitive promotional activity, but maybe yelling for that business and kind of how you respond to it, because it is obviously a decent chunk of the U.S. business. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","First of all, the breakdown between developing and developed; developing in the quarter was plus five, developed was plus one. We are in here with a total of plus three. In terms of family care, you rightly pointed to the issue, Bill, which is a -- which heightens competitive activity reflected in the amount of promotion that's going on in the category, primarily driven by Georgia-Pacific. I'm not at liberty to talk about future actions that we might take, but I'll assure you that that's a category that we intent to be competitive in and will be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks. So, just first real quick, Jon, I think you mentioned that there were gains coming in the fourth quarter -- you said three to four points. I just wanted to confirm that, but the real question is, look, obviously you face a ton of headwinds this year. And when you talk about productivity, you guys are using a term pull forward savings, right? You brought fiscal '13 savings into '14. You are almost at your 16 to 22 target on non-manufacturing roles. Can you talk about what that leads for '15? What do you need to sustain that pace of productivity? You need some of the supply chain stuff to start to come through? Or do you still see incremental runway from the sort of blocking and tackling savings that you are doing already? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So, first on the small brand divestiture gains in the fourth quarter, those should be between $0.03 and $0.04. Those are things we've talked about before; which is primarily the closure on the bleach sale, which we announced at CAGNY. That isn't a certain event we are going to have to wait to see how the regulators proceed. I think it is a certain event in terms if it's eventually happening, but the timing that is uncertain, but that's what's assumed in those numbers that I gave you.","In terms of productivity going forward, as I mentioned, I see -- we see several more years of significant productivity opportunity. I wouldn't take the acceleration of savings into last year, or this year as an indication of reduced savings potential next year or the following year. And I can assure you that as our leadership team discusses this topic, that's not the mindset that we have. So, I would expect similar levels of savings for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America","Great, thank you. I appreciate it. First, is it possible to parse out the impact of mix from a country perspective versus a category perspective considering that you think that the country will continue to be in a case of developing (indiscernible) developed versus the category which may flow overtime? Then, can you also update us on the percentage on market share that you are holding or gaining in overall also for the U.S? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","In terms of the components of mix, it's about half-and-half, Olivia, between the two drivers that you cited, and of course that varies quarter-on-quarter, but think of it as roughly 50-50. And then, yeah, the market share question, sorry. We are about flat on the quarter, the market is growing about 3% and that dynamic is true and our aggregate basis both globally and in the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah, thank you very much. Just a quick clarification, Jon, the organization design changes that you talked about, is that a function and output of what Jorge Uribe was working on, and if there is any more work to do in that area? And then, the actual bigger picture question is, can you just give us an update on the OTC business? And it seems like a scalable business where P&G can win with their brands. Any appetite for M&A; I know there is a lot of assets out there that potentially could kind of get unlocked for purchase. So, I just wanted to get a philosophical viewpoint on that. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Sure, Nik. First, as it relates to organization design, some of the changes that I talked about are very much a product of the work that Jorge Uribe and others have been leading. Most of it is just been put in place now or in the summer. And I fully expect that as that happens, not only our operations going to improve as we reduce duplication and increase clarity of accountability, but I expect that we will identify additional opportunities from those new ways of operating. That's very much what we saw when we set up the sector organizations a year ago. We had an estimate for savings that could be possible, but as we got into it, it became clear that there were additional savings possible.","This is again something we are going to keep grind in way at day-after-day, week-after-week, and create an organization that's not only more efficient, but is more effective that has a broader range of job responsibilities and is a funner, easier place to work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Ali Dibadj \u2013 Bernstein","Hi, guys. Do you want to go back to pick a few things; one is on the negative 75 basis points roughly of the mixed element on gross margin that should dissipate? Can you give us a sense of kind of over what timeframe you think that will happen, given all the investments you are making to grow the categories, but also frankly on a geographic piece as well I think your plans etcetera like the one in Brazil?","The second thing is, you mentioned on the release in the beauty section, the sales declines in salon and skin care, primarily in Asia. So, that mean you are getting better skin care stability in the U.S. And then, the last question is want to understand better the grooming negative 4% mix that we saw in the quarter. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Okay, let me first -- I apologize, Nik, I breezed by the second part of your question. Let me go back to that first, and then come back to you and if I continue my trend this morning forgetting the second part of the question, you can remind me what they were.","Nik, in terms of OTC, it is a space that we like, and certainly demographically advantaged, it's an area that we feel we have strength in within select product treatment areas. As we have said for several years, it is a place that we would consider adding to our business both organically. Clearly, the Teva joint venture has enabled us to accelerate our progress internationally quite significantly. We added the new chapter asset recently. So, it is a space that we will continue to look for opportunities in, but we are also going to be choiceful and value-driven as we pursue and evaluate those opportunities.","Only on the glide paths for mix, the developing\/developed split is so much informed by foreign exchange. I mean, there is a constant FX cost differential. I'd say that's -- I think we have talked before probably a three to five year glide path, it's not overnight, but we will get there just as we have in China, just as we have in Russia, just as we have in Saudi and places that we have been operating for longer periods of time. How much of that actually gets to the bottom line is going to be a function of FX, which is why I hesitate to say definitely it's going to be X period of time.","The second piece on skin care, we had a reasonably good quarter on both U.S. skin care, which was up mid single-digits, and on U.S. Pantene, which was also up mid single-digits. We continue to have opportunity in Asia. I wouldn't say that we have necessarily fully rounded the corner on either U.S. skin care or U.S. Pantene, but certainly are making a significant progress.","Then on Gillette mix, large part of that is geographic as you're probably well aware. We have some category growth challenges in the U.S., so the size of that market is down, and that's the most profitable piece of the business. That's something as category leaders were responsible for managing and we are actively doing that. We certainly like the position that we start from in that task. We have 70% of market share, the most profitable segment, huge levels of consumer loyalty, very high, especially relative to other participants in the category, net promoter scores. We offer really a significant value to consumers. A man can use Gillette Fusion ProGlide for a cost of about $1 a week. For that he gets uncompromised quality from a brand that spanned over a century developing the best shaving products for men.","We have significant innovation coming to market in the shave care space as well, which should help both market growth and mix going forward. We have launched the body product that we talked about at CAGNY. On the 29th of April, we will be revealing the next major innovation for Gillette, and well, I can't give details of that today. All of that will be revealed on the 29th. What I can tell you -- what man are telling us, which is that they prefer this product two to one versus the world's best selling razor currently. So, we are active in terms of managing the category challenge in the U.S. and are excited about some of the innovation that we are bringing the bearer to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Stieb with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Michael Stieb \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning, Jon. You mentioned earlier that emerging markets growth I think in the quarter was 5% if I understood that correctly. From memory, I think it was 8% in the last quarter. Could you just tell us where you are seeing most of that -- majority of that slowdown, please? And then on that note, could you also provide us an update on the growth that you are seeing in China, please?","Jon Moeller","Well, China continues to be a very attractive market. We have grown that business 50% over the last three years. And quarter-to-quarter there can be some chop, but it continues to be a very attractive market for us. Market growth in general in developing markets has slowed by one to two points over the last six months, and that's what explains most of the slowdown that I mentioned in our developing market business. Fiscal year-to-date were high singles, call it 7%. So, the 5% is two points lower than that. If you look at share as a measure of whether we are holding or losing ground, we built share in Brazil by more than half a point. We have built share value there for 22 consecutive quarters. We build share in India, where we have grown double-digits now for 47 consecutive quarters. We built a modest amount of share in Russia.","China; frankly is very hard to read shares at the moment. There is a significant channelship that's occurring, for instance, to e-commerce where we are doing very well on share point, but which Nielsen doesn't measure. We have wholesalers that are shifting from Nielsen measured retailers as their source of volume to non- Nielsen measured distributors. It's a bit complex, but again, it's a business we feel good about. We have got good innovation coming to market there. We just launched a premium diaper which in its early days has done extremely well taking market leadership in three out of the four, major e-commerce platform is for diapers in China in its early entry period.","So, as I said in our prepared remarks, I expect developing markets will continue to be a disproportionate source of growth across the board for many years to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. Two questions, first, a small housekeeping item. Can you give us a sense of what sort of gains you expect on the pet care business once it's sold, just as we think about modeling into next year?","Then, back to my other question, I want to go back to the organizational changes that you talked about in prepared remarks and a little bit in Q&A. I get the cost efficiency benefit of reducing role redundancy and merging countries into fewer SMO clusters, but I was hoping you could help me on your agility comment. How does further centralization and decision making in an already heavily centralized organization make you more agile? As you move forward with this, how do you ensure that local execution doesn't falter? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Good question. First relative to the gains, I think if we go back to the press release we issued moving out to the sale, we said we expected very little impact, positive or negative from a one-time gain standpoint from the sale of the pet business. John, can give you more specifics there later today, but generally it shouldn't be a major impact.","In terms of the organization question, I think there is couple of things that we can do a better job explaining. One is that there seems to be a notion that when we talk about global business units, that by definition moving work into global business units centralizes that work and moves it to a global level. I understand completely why one would have that conclusion, because when we describe it that's just what it sounds like, but that's not what happens. So, we have GBU resources at a global level, at a regional level, at a local level. We have brand managers at a global level, at a regional level, at a local level for each of our major product lineups.","So, what we are trying to do is just clarify that the work of brand building belongs with those people, locally, regionally and globally. It shouldn't be done by other organizations in addition to those resources. We need those resources focusing on one of the most strategic things we do, which is sell and build joint value creation with our customers. And you can imagine if you have two different organizations working on the same thing, from an internal standpoint how that can create a lot of complexity, if you're in an executional role in the organization, it's hard to know what to execute when you're getting multiple sources of direction. And so, clarifying this, de-duplicating it, should have both, I think, cost, opportunity associated with it, as well as enabling us to be more agile, be clear, be more decisive, be quicker in terms of the action that we take.","And to-date, over the last roughly two years, we reduced the number of overhead roles by 8,000 people. We've done that without significant business disruption, without significant organization disruption. It doesn't mean it's all done easy, but it gives us confidence that we can continue to improve here without being overly concerned about business disruption.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Please proceed.","Steve Powers - UBS","Hi, Jon. Good morning. Regarding your North American and potential western European supply chain restructuring programs, do you have any estimates for the costs, whether cash or non-cash associated with those programs in the 200 million to 300 million savings you mentioned? I guess how should we be expecting the flow over the three to four year life of the program? Will there be non-core charges, elevated CapEx; will it show up another area, etcetera? That's my main question.","Then just if I can tag on one more, which is related to taxes, I think the quarter and your guidance for next quarter imply kind of a tax rate for the year in the 21% to 22% range, if my math is right, I just wanted to get your update on whether you think that rate is sustainable going forward and what the risks are in either direction to sort of the more normalized tax rate as we look ahead? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","On supply chain, there will be costs, there will be capital; those will be significant, so obviously we wouldn't do this if we weren't running a significant return on those. We'll try to detail those for you at some level when we provide guidance for next year. As I mentioned earlier, we are still working through ordinary exploratory process of this in Europe. We would like to come to you with total package, which we will do as we provide our guidance for the year.","Within that though capital spending I don't see going -- I see it's staying in kind of 4% to 5% range as we execute this program. We'll continue working very had on working capital reduction as an offset to this. We've been able to do that successfully over the last three or four years with our whole build out program in developing markets, really maintaining our free cash flow productivity targets despite somewhat higher capital spending, and that's certainly the objective going forward.","So, I wouldn't consider it net of major change to the cash profile of the company. There will be some cost to execute it. Some of those will be non-core, some of those will be core, and we will provide more contexts with guidance.","Tax rates on the year, based on everything we know today should be 21%. We saw it a quarter ago. So that can change, but that's what we're seeing currently. This is going to continue to be a bit lumpy as we go forward. You're going to see quarters, where it's going to be lower that, you're going to see quarters, where it's going to be higher than. And that's a function of geographic mix, as you can appreciate. It's also a function of the timing of audits and reserve establishments and reserve reversals etcetera. We'd try to provide disclosure on the big chunks of that within our financial disclosures in our statements.","In terms of what can -- what are the major drivers that could affect tax rate going forward, clearly, again geographic mix can affect it. That should be generally a net positive as we go growth, assuming that developing markets continue to grow faster than developed markets, and there are lower tax rates in developing markets. The other change of course that is unknowable and can affect us either positively or negatively is our policy developments, both in the U.S. and overseas. Well, to say those in general, there seems to be a lot of competitiveness on the part of governments to maintain business-friendly status in a slower growing economy. So, I think it would be somewhat unlikely that there would be a major adverse event that would affect our tax rate significantly, but of course that's completely unknowable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. I just had a question for clarification on the supply chain savings. I think you were talking about $200 million a year, could you say if that is only for North America, and when you'd expect it to start?","Jon Moeller","The 200 million to $300 million range I gave you, which is a very off-range at this point, is inclusive of our early thinking on Europe. So, it's North America and Europe. We will start seeing some of those savings next year, particularly the distribution-related savings, as we consolidate distribution and customization centers into fewer distribution centers located closer to customers. That's a relatively smaller portion of the overall savings, which will accrue the major savings will start accruing in three and four years from now.","So, it's something that -- we're changing our footprint so dramatically that we want to do it in a very disciplined, organized way to avoid business disruption. The savings will be significant, but they will be -- they are not immediate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I will like to come back to the emerging market negative mix issue, and basically if you can help us, Jon, kind of like at least have an average emerging market gross margin and operating margin figure? And also, more philosophically, you have over $30 billion in sales in emerging markets, which is much -- these are much bigger than most your competitors combine, and essentially you have lower profitability, and then the question is, is it because you're leading with long categories, leading with categories that have low margins as opposed to leading with categories like beauty or healthcare, and essentially you're doubling down in the negative mix by leading with the legacy businesses, which is detergent and some paper as opposed to the high margin businesses, beauty, healthcare and grooming? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Javier. We'll give you some better gross and operating margin breakdown relative to company average for developing markets as part of our guidance for next year. The reason I'm not giving that to you right now is because it's all changing as we put in pricing for FX etcetera. And I'd like to get to a more stable situation, so I can give you something that's actually useful, but I understand the need and we can provide something that hopefully will help there.","In terms of our developing market business profitability, it's really a tale of two cities, in markets where we have been for extended periods of time, where we've developed the scale to justify localization of the supply chain, where we've built local organizations, and where we've developed significant relationships with our retail partners, we have very good margins; in many cases, at the company average, and in some cases, above the company average. So I mentioned markets before, like Russia, like China, like Saudi; there are number of examples. And take China as an example, that's not only our second largest market in terms of sales, it's our second largest market in terms of profit. So, obviously it's a very profitable situation there. And I think that is more what needs to occur than altering the mix of product categories in the markets where we're earlier on in our journey, like Brazil and like India.","We need to get the cost structure. We need to get consumer usage of premium products, which is happening -- it happened in China, it clearly happened in Russia; it's happening right now in Brazil, a little bit less so in India. Those are the things that will enable us to get margins to a place that I'm very confident that we'll get to, which is somewhere close to -- little bit below the company average.","Your point though on other categories is an important one. I mentioned earlier that we are really through the joint venture with Teva for the first time, building out our healthcare business, which is very high margin across the globe, including developing markets. We've talked before about the less expansion in Russia and Eastern Europe. We have some things going on in Latin America. And so, we will continue to where there are smart value-creating opportunities, expand not just the paper and detergent businesses, but also the beauty and healthcare businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning. Jon. I guess first question is in terms of the innovation strategy and how you're seeing it right now? Given that we've seen you go down market recently with Tide, also up market, it sounds like in blade razors, well, the emphasis still be on moving up market going forward and staying true to what has been a very successful trade-up strategy for you guys? Or given the environment, do you think the innovation going forward will be a little more balance between mid-tier and premium price points?","And then secondly, in terms of the outlook for next year, I know it's very early, so I'm not going to ask for guidance here, but given that you're going to be anniversarying the FX headwinds and given that the manufacturing startup costs are behind you, what do you see as the biggest headwinds of you guys in fiscal '15? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","In terms of innovation, we'll continue to pursue a balanced innovation strategy. If you just think about the laundry bundle in North America now, it has lower priced components, deigned for consumers for whom prices are a biggest part of their personal value equation, it also has premium items. We generated more new sales on Gain Flings than we did on Tide Simply Clean and Fresh in the last quarter. And innovation decisions are going to be guided by consumers, their needs and wants. It's less about price point, and it is about value for a particular consumer. Value, as you know is a combination of pricing and product efficacy, consumer experience, our communication of that experience etcetera. So, we are going to continue to be focused on consumers with whom we can create value and to whom we can provide value.","Relative to headwinds going forward, I think one of the biggest headwinds is market growth, both in developing and developed markets. The good news is we have a say in that, and we can create growth with innovation by trading in consumers, in many markets, trading consumers up in other markets, but that is -- it's challenging in a 3% growth world, and that's just the reality that we're going to have to adapt to. It is part and parcel of the combined productivity and innovation strategy. Those are the two things that are required to win in a slower growth environment. And the two things were committed to deliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please proceed.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Thanks for the question. I just want to go back to divestiture of the pet business, and I think we will go back few years when the divestiture of the coffee business, the plan was to take the proceeds and reinvest in actually restructuring and try to offset some of the dilution. And this divestiture, there is just for general corporate purposes. So, just trying to understand at what point, 2.9 million, 5 billion, I mean is there a philosophy change in terms of maybe reinvesting some of this money back into the business or reinvesting it to share repurchases or kind of a thought, because this doesn't seem to be one of the smaller divestitures you've done over the past few years?","Jon Moeller","A couple of things here; first of all, the 2.9 billion becomes 2 billion once we pay Uncle Sam. So that's the amount of cash that we're looking at this point. And really that cash that we'll earn next fiscal year, when the deal is likely to close; buyers have a nasty habit of not paying new until they have certainty on ownership of the asset. And so, we'll build that cash into our planning for next fiscal year, and we will be very clear with you how we're intending to use that.","Relative to the Folgers situation, there are two things that are different with regard to restructuring. The first is that Folgers was much more dilutive than pet is going to be, and so the need was greater from that standpoint.","Second, at the time that we announced Folgers, we didn't have a non-core restructuring program. And so, we chose to increase restructuring to accommodate that objective. We have a fairly robust restructuring program right now. We're not capped or limited. If there is more opportunity to generate return and create value by all means, we will. But again, this is a next year cash flow, and we will get back to you with the use of that cash as we describe plans for next fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Please proceed.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning. I have just a couple leftover housekeeping questions. You're 1% organic growth in the developed regions; can you break that out in terms of volume price and mix?","And my other question is when you give us your EPS growth adjusted for currency, could you explain what you take out to get to that number? Do you take out the pricing that you're getting in emerging regions? Is there an offset to currency? Do you take out all the cost benefits, the local cost benefits you're getting as the result of currency as well? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Developed market organic sales breakdown, we had 2% volume growth in developed markets, a minus 1 point price mix dynamic getting you to 1% organic sales growth. So that's the breakdown there.","The currency numbers do not include pricing. They do include the total transaction impact on the cost structure. So, if there are local cost benefits that's in the currency number. We just take our currency exposures on the rate of change, and that's the number we're providing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Yeah. Thanks, and good morning. I wanted to clarify a couple of things on the North America beauty business. Was there any benefit from restocking from destocking, a year ago, six months ago?","And then, from the slowdown in developing markets, any commentary there about whether the categories or a category-specific has become more promotional as a result of the slowdown?","Jon Moeller","I think the beauty organic sales numbers are representative of the state of the business. I don't think they include any one-time, significant one-time impacts of any sort. So I think you should look at them as decent numbers.","Relative to promotion levels, we're seeing increased promotion in North America in a few categories. We talked earlier about the family care category, where we have some increased promotion. We've seen increased promotion not surprisingly in response to our laundry innovation launches in North America. And we've seen increased promotion relative to -- in response to our innovation in the hair care space. But we look at those generally as temporary in nature, and it's not -- as I've said many time before, promotion is not high on our list of strategic choices to grow business, so it's certainly not a dynamic that we're going to be encouraging. If you look at price mix, inclusive of promotion, for the last quarter it was a positive impact on a global basis. It's been a neutral or positive impact for 13 consecutive quarters. It's been a positive impact for the last nine years.","So, we're going to try to compete on the basis of innovation, make sure the base price of our product is as sharp as it can be as a result of our productivity efforts. We'll need to be competitive on promotion levels, but it's not (indiscernible) that we're going to drive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Please proceed.","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Yeah. Good morning, Jon. You mentioned a significant shift to e-commerce in I think referring to China that you're seeing, but I guess, I suspect you are seeing a similar shift in perhaps developed markets as well. Should we think about this as a net positive for P&G manufacturers in terms of reach your ability to target consumers, even profitability? And if you could just discuss maybe that opportunity and any plans you have to capitalize on that channel shift over time?","Jon Moeller","We want to be available for consumers wherever they want to shop, and that includes the e-commerce space. Jon, you mentioned some very attractive aspects of that space. One is the ability to target -- to more narrowly target consumers, more effectively target consumers, and that's certainly relevant. There is also an opportunity to provide sometimes some more information as \"E\" in general becomes what we're calling the Zero Moment of Truth, and sometimes it's the zero and first moment of truth.","In general, e-commerce shoppers represent a more attractive demographic. We're seeing larger basket sizes in some of the e-commerce channels than in bricks and mortar, not always, but in some cases. And we're working very hard to ensure that our share of both sales and profits is at least as good as the case and more traditional retail channels. And that currently is the case. But this is a channel that's been evolving fast, and we'll continue to change significantly in the next three to five years and it's something that we need to do and intend to be a significant part of.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please proceed.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Good morning, Jon. It's on margins, I'm just looking at the EBIT margin expansion in beauty and grooming, and I'm wondering if going forward you believe you will be able to sustain that, or if you actually see some pickup in margins in any other divisions?","Jon Moeller","Well, I think sustaining 17% earnings growth, which is what you see in the beauty segment in the last quarter, is not an objective we would have. We're happy with that growth. We want over time to achieve more balance between that top line and bottom line. We're still delivering a very strong bottom line. And the bigger margin improvement opportunity I think comes as we do three things; 1) get the higher margin categories growing at their rate of category growth, and that includes beauty. 2) Improve our margins in developing markets as we've talked about with several of you this morning, and 3) is continue focusing on growth behind innovation in developed markets where we have higher margins. And that's -- all three are very much part of our thought process and activity system presently.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17516":["Procter & Gamble Co.

Bernstein & Co.","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call.","P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business, and has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Thanks and good morning.","As David Taylor said on the press release we issued earlier this morning, we continue to make progress on the transformation we are making to return P&G's results to a balance of strong top line growth, bottom line growth, and cash generation. We achieved a significant milestone this quarter in the transformation of the product portfolio with the exit of batteries business. We delivered another strong quarter of productivity improvement and cost savings. And we increased investments in innovation, advertising, and selling capacity to enhance our long-term prospects for faster, sustainable top line growth and value creation.","We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a volume and value basis have decelerated, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 3% to 4% globally. We now expect 3%.","There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory, with significant economic and political instability impacting incomes and consumption in many large and important markets: Russia, the Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the balance of the Middle East, Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil. We generate more than 10% of our annual sales and profit in these markets.","Currencies have weakened across the board since the start of our fiscal year. While the dollar has softened a bit recently, we still face up to $1 billion after-tax net earnings impact versus year ago, a $200 million increase since just the start of December. Across four years, FX has reduced net earnings by about $4 billion after tax, nearly 40% of fiscal year 2012 net earnings.","Against this backdrop, we remain focused on large opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step-changing cost and cash productivity, transforming our portfolio, strengthening our organization and culture, and reaccelerating top line growth with strength in category business models and innovation plans and, where appropriate, improved value equations. This transformation is aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth and leadership value creation. I'm going to talk briefly about each of those transformation steps, productivity, portfolio, organization, and top line reacceleration, before getting in to the details of the quarter.","We continue to dramatically improve cost and cash productivity, with significant upside still ahead. Our original five-year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, $1 billion or more above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down 20%. We're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017.","In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of March 31, we've reduced these roles by more than 24%, almost 2.5 times the original target. We expect to meet our latest target of 25% to 30% by the end of this year, one year ahead of schedule. Including divestitures, we'll reduce non-manufacturing roles by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017.","We're reducing non-working marketing expenditures, costs that do not impact reach, frequency, or continuity of our advertising and trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency fees. Last year we reduced the roughly 6,000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year, reinvesting those savings in advertising and sampling of consumer-preferred products.","Net of reinvestments in innovations, selling, media, and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating profit margin improvement in each of the last three fiscal years, driving double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of those years. We're on track to improve gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency impacts, again this fiscal year. We're driving productivity up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down. Payable days are up. Balance sheet productivity has enabled us to extend our long track record of very strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% in Q1, 117% in Q2, and 105% in the quarter we just completed, even as we spend capital to transform our supply chain.","We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. Over the past decade we have returned more than $118 billion in cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.","We said four years ago that we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity both inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in cost over the next five years. Our supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first in North America and Europe, then in Latin America and in India, Middle East, and Africa.","We're in an investment mode now, with savings to start in three to four years. Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of store shelves. We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations to replace smaller single-category sites in less cost-effective locations. We're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and facilitate faster innovation. We're employing smart automation and digitization to improve manufacturing productivity, raw material and finished product logistics, and demand planning. We have additional opportunity to optimize working capital and further increase the efficiency of our capital spend.","After two strong years of savings, we'll enter next year still spending $1.5 billion in agency-related marketing costs, still more room to improve. We'll continue to look for efficiencies in working media with better advertising targeting and earned media campaigns with engaging content.","As we fully operationalize the new focused 10-category company, there will undoubtedly be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility, and speed of decision-making. Digitization will continue to enable smart productivity choices.","Finally, we'll be working to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our promotion spending. We currently spend about $18 billion in deductions between gross and net sales. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of this spend for both us and our retail partners and to improve its efficiency.","So we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next five years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D and product and packaging improvements, sales capacity, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth and to create value for shareowners.","In addition to transforming our cost structure, we're transforming our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we've divested, discontinued, or consolidated 55 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 50 more brands in the exit process, including the 41 Beauty brands in the transaction with Coty. The S-4 registration statement for the Beauty transaction was filed last week. We're on track to close the deal in the second half of the calendar year.","In total we'll exit 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of fiscal 2013 profit. Going forward, we're anchoring our portfolio on 10 category-based business units and about 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company.","Within these core businesses, we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid, and long-term value creation, forgoing bad businesses even when these choices create near-term top line pressure.","In Mexico, for example, we made the choice to discontinue low-tier, unprofitable, and commoditizing toilet paper products in favor of very profitable high-tier differentiated products. Sales are down 75%, but before-tax margins have improved by more than 50 basis points, from very negative to nicely positive. It will take a few more quarters for the top line drag to dissipate, and we'll have a solidly value-accretive business going forward.","In India, we've made a choice to deprioritize several unprofitable lines of business which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates, but will lead longer term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly. The strategic portion of our India business is growing at a high single-digit pace. Sales in the portion we're fixing or exiting have been down more than 30%. This top line pain is worth it. We're making significant progress in improving local profit margins, up about 700 basis points. We've gone from losing significant money in India to triple-digit profits in just two years.","We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches and tablets, and value-tier detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag of nearly a point on the global Fabric Care business, but profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business improves. Combined, these choices are causing about a one-point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and then dissipate as we annualize more of the impacts. As we come out of this, we'll have stronger top line growth that is worth something on the bottom line.","We're transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together are significant and important. As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We eliminated overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability. Reflecting this, we changed the name of the market development organizations to Selling and Market Operations, small but very important.","We're increasingly staffing leadership roles in the selling and marketing operations with leaders who have significant selling experience. We're changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple, improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to winning.","Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets, sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is a change. We're aligning incentives at a lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and to increase accountability.","Another example of the evolution of our thinking on the organization is what David talked about at CAGNY. He said that P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent and that we intend to maintain our develop-from-within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role may not be inside our organization. Going forward, we're going to look at outside hiring more often when we need it to field the best team possible. The bottom line is that we're committed to getting, keeping, and growing the right talent in the right place to better drive business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively they are big and important changes for our organization and culture.","A very important area of transformation is the reacceleration of top line growth. We expect to make progress in all 10 product categories, but we're putting specific emphasis against the four largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care, and Grooming; and the two largest markets, the U.S. and China. These four categories represent over 60% of sales and profit. These two countries represent nearly 50% of sales and more than 50% of profit.","We're growing our Fabric Care business with consumer-preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium priced unit-dosed detergents and our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. We're exiting slower growing, lower-priced, more commoditized product forms where it's more difficult to distinguish our products and create value. Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrates what's possible when we deliver superior value with best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry detergent market is continuing to grow behind these efforts, with the category up more than four points on a value basis over the last three, six, and nine-month periods.","The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancers category is growing, up more than six points on a value basis over the last three, six, and nine-month periods.","Our share is growing. P&G's U.S. laundry detergent and fabric enhancer value shares were each up nearly a point in the March quarter. We will continue to be the innovation leader in Fabric Care. In North America, we're introducing a new regimen on Tide and Downy that addresses the odor problems common to athletic wear. Seventy percent of consumers wear athletic gear multiple times each week. The Odor Defense collection, anchored by innovation on Tide Pods, brings a proprietary formula of enzymes and surfactants that break down and remove stubborn soils and residues for a great clean and fresh scent. Paired with the added cleaning power of Tide Odor Defense Rescue laundry booster and Downy Fresh Protect Odor Defense beats, this regimen promises to eliminate odors from the fast-growing market of athleisure clothes people are wearing far beyond the gym.","Next month we start our learning market on Tide Pure Clean liquid detergent in the U.S. Naturals is a large and growing segment in several categories, but naturals are only about 3% of the laundry category. Unlocking growth in naturals is about solving the tension between green and clean. People want performance and sustainability. Pure Clean provides the cleaning power of Tide with 65% bio-based ingredients, and it's produced with 100% renewable wind power electricity in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill.","We're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, and China. In Russia and Turkey, where we launched superior compact liquid detergents early last calendar year, P&G's share of liquid detergents are up seven points and 14 points respectively. We've increased sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and change for consumers. Last fiscal year, we distributed 5 million samples in washing machines globally. This fiscal year, we'll distribute about 17 million. In calendar year 2016, we'll distribute 30 million samples of our best performing products.","In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs, and a robust online presence have led to strong growth for Pampers. Pampers value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up a point in the March quarter. Pampers' latest Swaddlers and Cruisers innovation, Extra Absorb Channels, was off to a good start in the new calendar year, with Swaddlers and Cruisers share up more than a point in the last quarter.","We strengthened investments in brand awareness and trial at the point of market entry. Seventy percent of new moms in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal baby shower and hospital programs.","Last fiscal year marked the seventh consecutive year of sales and value share growth for the Luvs brand in the U.S. However, results have been down so far this year following a significant price reduction taken by our primary competitor. We're taking steps to improve the awareness, trial, and consumer value of Luvs. We increasing equity-building advertising, strengthening in-store programs, and have product and packaging improvements slated for launch next quarter.","Baby Care results have been softer in other markets. To address this, we've strengthened our value proposition in several markets and accelerated premium innovation on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point of market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms.","In Hair Care, we launched our new conditioner innovation on Pantene in the U.S. last quarter. Pantene's new breakthrough conditioner technology delivers Weightless Conditioning, addressing the most significant consumer trial barrier in the category. The new conditioner innovation is a consumer blind test winner versus our best competition in North America, China, and Japan.","We continue to strongly support Head & Shoulders, one of our steadiest and strongest growing brands, delivering over 8% compound average sales growth over the past 10 years, even with significant currency impacts. Organic sales for Pantene and Head & Shoulders were each up high single digits in the U.S. in the March quarter.","Gillette has delivered steady growth in international markets so far this fiscal year behind strong innovation, advertising, and sampling programs. Gillette is holding or growing value share in each region outside the U.S. The growth in international markets has been offset by soft results in the U.S.","To improve our growth and the growth of the market, we're investing in innovation, new user trial, and improved consumer value. We're expanding our performance advantage at the top end of the market. Our most recent cartridge innovation, Gillette Fusion ProShield, launched last quarter. ProShield with lubrication before and after the blades shields against irritation during every shave. Early consumption results in the U.S. have been tracking ahead of plan.","We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall ProShield to MACH3 to premium priced and superior performance disposables, with stronger consumer value communication. We're facing more aggressive competition at lower price points, and we will respond to ensure our brands remain a superior consumer value.","We've stepped up new trial activities in the U.S. with our 18th birthday sampling program. We have put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men, over 2 million samples last year, a 33% increase over the prior year level. We've now begun sampling the FlexBall razor handle and the ProShield cartridge, our very best combination of shaving technologies.","We're not standing still in the other categories. We've delivered solid organic sales growth in the U.S. this quarter in the Feminine Care, Family Care, and Home Care categories, all big and profitable businesses for us. P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our U.S. categories. In the IRI Innovation Pacesetters report just published, P&G had four of the top 10 innovations and six of the top 13. Top innovations recognized for 2015 sales were Tide Simply Clean & Fresh, Always Discreet, Fusion ProGlide FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Febreze Unstoppables, and Tide Plus Ultra Stain Release. Overall in the U.S., organic sales were up 2%, in line with underlying market growth of our categories. Organic volume was up 3% for the quarter.","We're making progress in China, but there's still more work to do. We narrowed sales declines by half this quarter and expect to improve again next quarter. We recently upgraded our Pampers premium diaper pants to improve fit and softness, and we have new innovations coming soon on mid-tier pants and premium taped diapers. Oral-B Super Premium toothpaste launched in over 700 stores last quarter, reaching roughly a 5% share in those outlets. We'll triple distribution on this item this quarter. Ariel is growing in China following the concentrated liquid detergent launch in January. Gillette Fusion FlexBall has driven male razor system share growth over the past three, six, and 12-month periods. And SK-II continues to deliver very strong growth, with sales for the quarter up nearly 20%.","So some bright spots are emerging, but it will take time to get fully back to target growth rates. We are realistic that improvements in top line growth won't happen overnight and they won't happen in a straight line, but they will continue to improve over time.","Let me move now to the quarter we just completed and to the outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales were up 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. The impact from the portfolio cleanup efforts I discussed earlier was about a one-point drag on organic sales growth. All-in sales were down 7%, including a five-point headwind from foreign exchange, three points from the combination of Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures.","Core earnings per share were $0.86, down 3% versus the prior year. Core gross margin increased 270 basis points. Core operating margin increased 300 basis points. This quarter's core earnings per share results included a net FX headwind of approximately $90 million after tax or $0.03 per share, comprised of a negative spot rate impact of about $230 million, which was partially offset by a $140 million balance sheet revaluation impact in the base period that did not recur this year.","Venezuela continues to be a difficult market and was also a drag on March quarter results. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we announced our decision to deconsolidate our Venezuelan operations, no longer reporting sales or profits from products locally manufactured and sold in Venezuela. We continue to recognize sales and profit on products sold to our Venezuelan subsidiaries from non-Venezuelan P&G entities. We highlighted at CAGNY that a disruption in our Venezuelan subsidiary's ability to access dollars to pay for these imports of finished products could have a negative impact on our top and bottom line results.","We've been unable to access U.S. dollars in any size since November, and as a result reported no sales or profit for Venezuela in the March quarter. This caused a 20 basis point organic sales growth reduction in the quarter. On the bottom line, the total impact of Venezuela was $0.05 per share or 6% in terms of core EPS. Assuming these financing constraints continue, the bottom line impact on the year will be up to $0.10 per share or minus 3%.","The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, up 800 basis points versus last year, a $0.10 per share impact on core earnings per share and 11 percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth. The base period tax rate was unusually low due to the geographic mix of earnings and due to audit settlements, and the current period rate was inflated by a valuation allowance against net operating loss carry-forwards. These two items account for about six points of the eight-point change in the tax rate.","These three impacts, FX, Venezuela, and tax, were a combined core earnings per share growth headwind of 20% this quarter.","On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.97 for the quarter, up 29% versus the prior year. We generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, yielding 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.9 billion to shareholders this quarter through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividends and $1 billion in share repurchase. In addition, we received approximately $4.2 billion of stock through the Duracell transaction.","Earlier this month, we increased the dividend 1%, making this the 60th consecutive year the company has increased the dividend. The size of the dividend increase reflects FX headwinds, the cash impacts from streamlining and strengthening the business unit portfolio, and our plans to increase investments in the business to accelerate top line growth.","Moving to guidance, our outlook for the fiscal year reflects four large factors driving lower earnings in the fourth quarter. First, lower non-operating income; we expect about $100 million less in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Second, tax; the Q4 tax rate will likely be again about 800 basis points higher than last year due to the geographic earnings mix and audit settlement benefits in the base period. Third, investment levels; we'll have a significant increase in advertising expense coupled with continued reinvestment in R&D and selling capabilities. Fourth, FX; we'll continue to see significant spot rate impacts on both the top and bottom line in Q4 and, unlike the last two quarters, will not have offsets from base period balance sheet revaluation changes. Combined, we expect these four factors to lower Q4 net earnings by more than $800 million and reduce core earnings per share by more than 32% versus the prior year.","For the fiscal year, we're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes we'll no longer benefit from sales of finished product to our deconsolidated subsidiaries in Venezuela. This will be roughly a 30 basis point drag on Q4 organic sales growth.","In addition, the roughly one-point drag from the core portfolio cleanup will continue into Q4. We expect FX will have a six to seven percentage point impact on all-in sales growth for the fiscal year. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestitures will have a two to three percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales will be down high single digits versus fiscal 2015.","We continue to expect constant currency core earnings per share growth in the mid-single digits for the year. Foreign exchange will reduce net earnings by approximately $1 billion versus the prior year, resulting in a nine percentage point or $0.35 per share impact on core earnings per share growth for the year.","With one quarter left in the year, we're tightening and improving our core earnings per share guidance range from down 3% to 8% to down 3% to 6%, which puts the midpoint of the range at $3.59 per share versus last year's core earnings per share of $3.76. Fiscal year earnings per share guidance includes headwinds of 10 percentage points from the combined impacts of Beauty deal expenses, Venezuela deconsolidation, lower non-operating income, and a higher tax rate. Adjusting for these items, our guidance translates to modest core earnings per share growth, with meaningful growth excluding foreign exchange.","We expect the core effective tax rate to be 25% or higher for fiscal 2016, more than four points higher than last year, roughly a six-point headwind on core earnings per share growth. We're raising our fiscal year outlook for free cash flow to 100% or more of adjusted net earnings. We expect to reduce outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of direct share repurchases and the shares that were exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total, $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchases. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be up in the range of 46% to 51%.","Moving briefly to 2017, David is going to join me on our next call, scheduled for Tuesday, August 2, to discuss our plans and outlook for fiscal 2017. We're currently in the early planning stages for next year and will give guidance on the next call, but there are a few things to keep in mind as you review your estimates between now and then.","We expect improvements in organic sales growth, though core portfolio cleanup will still be a headwind. Venezuela will be a drag on the first two quarters of the year. If currency exchange rates hold steady through next fiscal year, FX should be much more manageable than it's been for the past few years, but we'll still have a headwind on both the top and bottom line, particularly in the first two quarters.","Likewise, if commodity costs hold at recent levels, we'll continue to see a modest tailwind in the first half or so of next fiscal year. We'll be increasing investment in R&D, in product and packaging programs, in sales capacity, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to accelerate top line growth in a responsible and sustainable way. We'll defend the relative consumer value of our brands and invest to address value gaps if and when they emerge. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint, and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of cash return to shareholders. There will be an EPS benefit from shares eliminated with our category exits, though the exact amount of which will depend on when we actually close the Coty transaction. We'll obviously give more specifics on all of this on our next call, but we thought it might be helpful to offer you these early thoughts.","To sum up, we continue to make progress on returning P&G to balanced top and bottom line growth. We're nearing the completion of the portfolio transformation. We have created and are sustaining strong cost savings and cash productivity momentum. We're strengthening the organization and culture, and we're investing to accelerate top line growth.","That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will available in slides which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. Now I'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Good morning, thanks. Jon, you mentioned that advertising was up 120 basis points, and it's been a while since we've seen an increase of this magnitude on the ad line. So is this a level we should expect going forward, or does it still move materially from here?","And then price overall came in, so how much of that was incremental promotion, step up in sampling that you're doing, and things like that? Perhaps you can break out what the impact of price was between developed and developing markets, if you could help us out there.","And then just lastly, you tightened the core EPS range, as you mentioned. But given that there's just one quarter left in the year, you left the full-year organic sales target unchanged, which obviously implies an incredibly wide range for Q4. So maybe can you refine your expectations a bit there and the main factors that impact where you fall within that range? Thanks a bunch.","Jon Moeller","First of all, congratulations, Olivia, on the birth of your child, and welcome back to work. You're coming back strong with four questions in one, but it's great to have you back.","In terms of the advertising rates, we were up about I think 130 basis points in the quarter. We expect to be up about 140 basis points on the second half, so there will be some sequential strengthening of that comparison as we move forward. I tried to say eight or nine times in our prepared remarks that we will be investing to grow our top line. We'll be funding that with productivity and bringing to the bottom line with it.","There has not been a significant increase in the percentage our business being sold on promotion, nor has there been a significant increase in the depth of those promotions. We have in several markets used sales deducts as a way to adjust pricing back to competitive levels where we took more of a price increase than our competitors ultimately did, so you see that impact. And I would just think about price adjustment and value gap closures as being the explanation for the change in the price component of the top line.","And as for fourth quarter guidance, we just provided it. It is what it is. And I think that the range, you rightly point out, is a wide one. That's the reality of the world that we're operating in, with very significant volatility, whether it's input costs, FX, geopolitical and geo-economic dynamics, and the consumer impacts of things like oil prices. And we're going to be living with that volatility for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen Powers","Great, thanks. Hey, Jon, I think you called out $18 billion in gross-to-net spending, which is close to 27% \u2013 28% of your expected net revenues this year. And so first, can you just confirm that I heard that right? Second, assuming that I did, can you just talk about how that spending rate compares to maybe five or 10 years ago because I think it's up significantly?","And then third, I'm curious how you assess the ROI on that spending. And as you optimize it going forward, how much opportunity do you see to reduce it? And then of that reduction, how much is likely to get reinvested elsewhere in the P&L as we think about the next several years? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So yes, Steve, you got the number right, it's $18 billion. Yes, it has increased over time, driven in part by expansion of modern retailers on a global basis, who have brought that business model with them to other parts of the world that previously were, for example, largely a distributor and wholesaler in markets.","There is significant opportunity within that bucket of spend to first and foremost increase its effectiveness, ensuring that we're spending it in ways that drive category growth on a sustainable basis as opposed to short-term pantry loading, for example; shifting spending to our best product offerings, to increase the trial and repurchase rates of those items with consumers, again, not driving so much in some cases the lower end of the portfolio; the vehicles that we use to communicate in store and how those are constructed and utilized in conjunction with our retail partners. So there are just massive opportunities to improve the effectiveness of that spend as we work to reaccelerate the top line growth.","There are also efficiency opportunities. And this is one of those unique and wonderful costs, if there is such a thing, where if you're able to reduce it, benefits both the top line and the bottom line. But we'll be very judicious as we do that. Again, really wanting where we have opportunities to shift that from ineffective spend to effective spend is the primary activity in this space. But I'm convinced within an $18 billion spend pool, we have efficiency opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz","Hi, Jon. Good morning.","Jon Moeller","Hi. Good morning, Bill.","William Schmitz","Can you just give us some more color on the reinvestment strategy? So you talked about the increases this quarter and next quarter. But how long will the advertising restoration period last? Where are you going to focus? I think you talked about hair care, laundry, and diapers to start. And then what you trying to achieve? Because I think maybe the last two or three years you said market share is not a primary driver of the business. It's really about growing the categories profitably. But does that change as you feel more pressure to close the gap in organic growth versus your peers? Frankly, I think the scoreboard you have is organic growth, right? And so I think that's obviously really important.","And then really quickly, just a housekeeping item; I know you don't have the exact numbers. But can you give us a rough cut at what you think the earnings upside is from both the Duracell and the Coty divestitures?","Jon Moeller","You asked a very important question, Bill. How do we think about top line growth and what are we trying to achieve there, and how do you think about the different metrics, whether it's category growth, organic sales, or market share? First and foremost, we need to accelerate our top line growth rate, and there's no debate about that.","The reason that we've talked a little bit about not following share out the window, we can be gaining shares in categories that are declining, and that's not going to grow our top line. What we need to be doing as innovation leaders in our categories is getting the market growing through that innovation and gaining a share of that growth. That's exactly what we're doing in Fabric Care in the U.S., for example. And it's taken a while, but it's worked extremely well. And the category is growing 4%. We're getting a disproportionate part of that growth. And that's what we are looking to do across our product categories. So it's bringing innovation to the market, which grows categories for the industry, for our retail partners, and allows us to gain a little bit of share in the process. And look, we need to be growing at the rate of the market or better, but market growth is an important element of that in terms of how attractive that growth ultimately ends up being. So it's all of the above.","In terms of earnings per share upside from Duracell and Coty, I think we've talked before that we plan to be non-dilutive from day one. We've been working for two years on the stranded overheads that are going to be created as a result of this. And we also expect that the portfolio that we're going to be left with is a healthier, stronger portfolio that will grow and will grow more profitably.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning. I'm not sure if you fully answered what Bill had referenced in terms of the reset on advertising spending, so I'm guessing he's still looking for some color on thoughts around reinvestment and maybe extending beyond just it being about advertising, but also the investments in product quality and packaging and timeline for that.","I also wanted to get color on your comments on consumer value investments, particularly in Gillette in the U.S. and Baby in the U.S. Just in Luvs, I wonder about how you think about Luvs pricing versus private label and positioning. And then for Gillette, it seemed like you were talking about the lower end of where you compete in the shaving category. But anything else you can share there would be great. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Thanks for the save for Bill there, Lauren. Sorry, I did miss that. As I said in the earlier remarks, we're reinvesting in not just advertising. I went through three examples of sampling to generate trial, getting our best products in the hands of consumers. That's a significant portion of investment. I mentioned as well expanding our sales capacity. That's happening across some of the newer channels, but also in our existing channels, dedicating sales coverage to individual categories and sectors, which has required and will require some investment. So it's broad-based. You mentioned package. There are clear opportunities to continue to improve our first moment of truth, which is a lot about the package, and we'll continue to do that as well.","In terms of specific numbers for next year across those buckets, we're in the early stages of putting our plan together for next year, but our intent is clear, I think. And as I said, we'll continue to work to fund those investments through continued productivity savings as well.","On value equation, there's really no change here in terms of our intent to be competitive across price tiers on big businesses that matter and big markets that matter. And clearly that involves Grooming in the U.S. You mentioned Baby in the U.S. I'm not going to get into specifics about the pricing moves that will be made. I'm not allowed to do that by law. But we'll be competitive. I don't think \u2013 in fact, I'll leave it there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher","Thanks. Jon, you mentioned improvement in profitability, I think it was in India, over the past several years, mostly coming from I think improved manufacturing logistics in local markets. Can you talk about the state of that process? And are there still markets in emerging markets where you're losing money where you could benefit from moving that?","And then I guess on the flip side of that, volumes have been weak generally. And so how do you deal with some of the stranded manufacturing capacity in some of the major markets where you've been producing this product, and is that a piece of the productivity we've been seeing for the past couple of years? And then how long do you think it takes to get to a more sustainable operating margin in some of these emerging markets on a broader basis? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","On the broad question of developing market margins and steady states, I can't answer that without getting into, unfortunately, FX. The answer to the question involves what happens to foreign exchange rates going forward.","For perspective, we've been growing constant currency earnings in developing markets well ahead of constant currency sales, going back three years ago 2x, the year after that 4x, last year 8x, this year 8x. And that reflects the things that you're describing in terms of the supply chain. It also reflects the overall productivity program and its benefits in the developing market, and it reflects a lot of work that we've been doing on our portfolio, as I described in our earlier commentary. The biggest driver of the really nice profit improvement in India has been that portfolio work. So it's all of that.","In terms of volume and the impact that it's had on our fixed cost rates, if you will, in the supply chain, it's definitely had an impact. The good news is that we're right in the middle of the supply transformation, and that's going to be multi-geography in nature. So that gives us an opportunity, where we need to, to rationalize that fixed cost infrastructure. At the same time, hopefully the main benefit going forward in terms of that is reacceleration of volume and sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Thanks. Jon, can you provide some context on where within the P&G organization are the pricing decisions made? And have those decisions changed, or are you planning to change who dictates local market pricing for new innovation and the core portfolio? Any context on that would be helpful.","Jon Moeller","So there are two forms of pricing decisions, if you think about it. One is what I'll call strategic pricing choices. That's the establishment of the pricing strategy, the price corridors you want to hold between markets, the price corridors you want to hold between competitors, whether they be branded or retail competitors. And those choices are made by our global business units, who have representation in both regions and countries, more representation in regions and countries than at the global headquarters. These are people who are very close to what's happening in the marketplace in terms of consumption, in terms of trade customers, in terms of competitors and consumers.","And then there are tactical adjustments that occur on a routine basis as each day and week unfolds. And we're trying to give more flexibility to resources located closer to the action, to manipulate \u2013 or to move agilely there as they need to. So we're going to hopefully achieve the best of both, and we'll see how that works going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, good morning, two questions. First of all, can you talk a little bit more about China? I know you said that your business is showing some signs of improvement, down not as much given some of the premium price innovation you're doing. But how confident are you in the strategy of pursuing what sounds like almost exclusively premium price innovation? Because it does sound like from some of the other competitors out there that there is also price-based competition going on in some of your big markets. So if you can talk about China more broadly and the strategy there, that would be great.","And then my second question has to do with your comment that I think we've heard. I think we heard it from Bob McDonald a few years ago that P&G was increasingly open to hiring from the outside. And I know we've had certain partnerships in R&D stuff. But in terms of actual physical new hires, outside of legal and tax and HR, I can't think of anybody on the business side who you actually have brought in from outside. So given that you've been saying that for so long, are there particular areas where you think that that is a priority? Is it marketing? Is it something in specific businesses? And why say it for so many years and then not have it actually happen? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So first on China, I'm glad you asked the question you did, Wendy. That big middle of the portfolio is very important, and we're not losing sight of that. We have fantastic positions in that portion of the market which we intend to maintain and build. But we also want to take advantage of the higher growth portion of the market, which is currently the premium tiers. Fifty percent of consumption is currently in those tiers across our categories. They're growing at high single to double-digit rates. And we obviously want to participate in that, not only for the sales and volume benefit, but also for the equity halo that it provides to our brands. So it is clearly an \"and\" strategy, not an \"or\" strategy.","Your question on our approach to bringing in talent from outside the organization, I think David was very clear about that at CAGNY that we are going to maintain broadly our promote from within and develop from within, most importantly, program. But we are going to put the right people, the best people in jobs across the organization. And when that requires that we go outside, we'll do that. We have, for example, hired a number of experienced salespeople. I mentioned building our sales capacity. As we're dedicating selling organizations to categories and sectors, there are cases where we can find more experience outside the company, people who have had 10 years' experience in a category where we may be underrepresented, and we're bringing those people in.","The whole area of digital marketing and media, where we need resources, we're either partnering with agencies who have that capability. In some cases, we're bringing it in. I don't think that's limited to any portion of the organization. That includes line management. But we're going to approach this deliberately. Having someone come in just for the sake of having them come in and being able to say that we're making progress there is obviously not something that interests us very much. But having the right people in the right jobs, bringing mastery to help us win across the board, we're definitely committed to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hi, good morning.","Jon Moeller","Hi, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian","Jon, as you look out to fiscal 2017, are you expecting to be able to recover some of the net negative historical gap between FX and pricing from the last couple of years through pricing? Or with the lower commodities and at least less onerous FX, is pricing not expected to be a large factor next year?","And then also, I was just hoping for some commentary on if you're confident that you'll see an equivalent level of volume rebound going forward as the overall level of pricing decelerates. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Dara. I would expect pricing to be less of a dynamic next year than it has been the last two years, simply because at current spot rates FX would be less of a dynamic next year than it has been the last two years. I also mentioned that in some cases where we've had large gaps emerge, we'll be working to close those. But we're still seeing significant devaluation in some markets. There are still situations where we're going to be taking additional pricing where we feel that that will be matched. So it will continue to be a dynamic, but a little bit less going forward.","On the volume piece, I certainly don't have a crystal ball. But if I look at what's happened historically, that volume has come back over time. Sometimes it depends on the market, but volume reacceleration in markets like Latin America has been fairly quick. In other markets, for example, Russia, the last crisis it took us three years to get back from a volume standpoint. So we'll have to see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William Chappell","Thanks, good morning, just two things. One, on the U.S. shaving business, can you give us a little more color? It's a focus area, both the U.S. and shaving. You've had new innovation. But do you see signs that as we move through the quarter, as we move into next year that the growth dynamics can change and maybe follow more like laundry?","And then also maybe for a bigger question, I understand that next year is still a transition year and you're stepping up advertising and marketing. How long does it take to get to your kind of growth algorithms excluding stuff like Russia or a global crisis per se?","Jon Moeller","In terms of Grooming, this is really primarily driven by two things. One is the market, as you rightly point out, and the other is some of the promotion at primarily the lower end of the portfolio. If you look at the past three months, market consumption in tracked channels was down 4%. That's largely due to lower shaving incidences. And also that number, just the math of that number, doesn't pick up the volume from direct sellers, and that's had some impact on that tracked channel number as well. We estimate that total market growth inclusive of e-commerce sales is flat to slightly growing versus year ago, and that's an improvement versus where we've been.","The top end of our portfolio is doing very well. ProGlide cartridges sales grew 18% last fiscal compared to a 7% decline in the overall market, and those kinds of trends are continuing. As I mentioned, we need to do more work on the lower end of the portfolio. We also need to be more present than we are in the direct-to-consumption e-commerce channels. And we need to bring innovation equally across the portfolio and marketing equally across the portfolio, which we're committed to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Good morning, everyone. Jon, I think that it would be helpful if you gave us a sense in a very top line way, volume and pricing between developed and emerging markets. I know that the U.S. was up 3%, but I would like to know what's happening with Europe as well. And how was the aggregate growth in emerging markets?","And in emerging markets, how much of that has been \u2013 continues to be destocking in China, or are there any other one-time in terms of wholesalers' dynamics that is impacting your growth in developing markets? And again, in China, why is destocking so protracted? Shouldn't you be better off to just purge the wholesalers' inventory and just starting to roll out whatever innovation that you have? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","So in terms of the breakdown between developed and developing, Javier, volume in developing was down 5%. In developed it was up 3%, which is really strong, by the way. Organic sales growth in developing was down 1%. In developed it was plus 2%. And so obviously price\/mix then deductively was plus 4% in developing and minus 1% in developed.","In terms of the trade stocking issue in China, we're making progress. As I said, our rate of decline was halved in the quarter, and in many categories we've returned to growth. And we're doing everything we can to bring that back in a responsible way, and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good morning, everybody. I know you don't want to give too much detail on fiscal 2017, but you talk about expected organic sales growth to improve in the year. I guess given FX headwinds in the first half and your prior commentary about not focusing on market share given FX headwinds, is it fair to say that any share improvement then would be back-half weighted?","And then more broadly, how should we all think about reinvestment required to return the business to top line growth? You talk about all this reinvestment on a go-forward basis, but if there's some way that we can quantify it or measure it not just in terms of what the advertising spend is on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But is there some sort of bogey out there or benchmark that helps us figure out basically where you're headed?","Jon Moeller","Fair question, Mark. Unfortunately, I have a difficult time answering that as we sit here today. We're literally just beginning the process of putting our plans together for next year. To give you some insight into that process, though, we're going to go through each of the large category\/country combinations and ensure that we're efficient in terms of our investment to change the growth profile and ideally to grow at the market, and then as we go through the year try to improve that. I'm not going to call a quarter in which that's going to happen. It's going to take time, as I said in the prepared remarks. It's not going to be a straight line, but I think we'll see improvement over time.","And there's no bogey in terms of a number related to investment. This is strategic planning at the category, country, and brand level that we're just beginning to do. You've seen the increased investment profile in the back half of this fiscal year. That's the only one I really have real insight into at this point. And I certainly wouldn't expect the investment levels to be lower as we go forward into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Altobello","Thanks, good morning, guys. First question, in terms of the 1% organic growth, can you tell us how that compared to consumption? I know it was a deceleration from last quarter, but last quarter you shipped a little bit ahead of consumption, so I was curious if that evened out in this quarter.","And then secondly, just going back to Bill Chappell's question for a second, what is P&G's long-term algorithm right now given the changes in the portfolio, and how quickly can you get there? I imagine 2017 is probably too optimistic, but could we see a return to that by fiscal 2018? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","In terms of the relationship between consumption and shipments, you're right. We had said in January that for the December quarter there was a little bit more sell-in than consumption and you see that reflected in the third quarter, and that's where that's really reversed itself and evened out. So I think we're in a steady state at this point in the process. I think that's also an important point in understanding the difference between the 2% last quarter and the 1% this quarter in terms of organic sales growth. That and Venezuela really explain all of that change. So thanks for asking that question.","I think it would be \u2013 in terms of the long-term algorithm that has not changed. We want to be growing with the market to slightly ahead of the market. And we believe that with continued productivity progress, that should translate into mid to high single-digit earnings per share growth. I do think that getting back fully to that algorithm next year would be difficult, but again, we're just beginning to put our plans together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. There we go. Can you hear me?","Jon Moeller","Yes, Jason.","Jason English","All right. I'm going to ask a multipart question as well. First, coming back to top line, you mentioned category growth slowing from I think 3% to 4% to roughly 3%. How much of that is volume-related versus price-related? And per your comments on the forward with FX if it holds, commodities if they hold, potentially price abating, should we expect global category growth to slow even further?","And then the second question was on the savings target. This could just be a matter of semantics, but I heard you say up to $10 billion. So should we consider $10 billion as the cap and a bit of a stretch goal that may not be achieved? And also on the supply chain side, you mentioned upfront investment, savings will build in three to four years. Should we be thinking about the delivery against those savings as being further out, so a bit more protracted than what we've seen over the last $10 billion?","Jon Moeller","Great. So if I just look at the difference between value growth and volume growth in the markets, to get at your question of how much of it is pricing, in developed markets, if I just look over the past year basically, volume growth has actually accelerated a little bit, gone from zero to 1%. Value growth is unchanged at about 1%. And in developing markets, value growth has gone from 9% to 6%. Volume growth has gone from 2% to 1%. So I think with that set of numbers, you can put the picture together that you're looking to put together.","In terms of the savings target and the semantics around \"up to\", those are the words we've used since we first started talking about this back at CAGNY, and that doesn't imply a cap. There's no reason to cap, but it does imply a range of outcomes. And last time we said $10 billion, we over-delivered that. So again, there was no cap. I think $10 billion is a good number to shoot for, and I'm sure we'll get somewhere close to that, if not there. You may recall a conversation that some of us were having four years ago on this topic, and there was a lot of concern about whether we would actually get to $10 billion. And I said again, that's the right number to shoot for. And if we only get to $9 billion, I'm going to be pretty happy. And I look at it the same way this time around, so really no change there.","On the supply chain transformation, that particular portion of the savings will come later, as we've indicated since we started talking about supply chain transformation. I wouldn't take that as indicative of the entire program. Last time around, it was pretty evenly paced across the fiscal years. That's not the design intent. That's just how it fell, and I don't see a reason for it to fall significantly different from that this time. Remember, though, and I know you know this, we are going to be reinvesting a lot of these savings. And on a relative basis more of that investment acceleration, if you will, will occur in the early years. And then as that gets fully in place, it will obviously have less of a year-to-year impact.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. I actually appreciate the tradition of always giving me the last word on the call. I hope it's a sign of respect for our work. So two things, one is I know you're pretty reluctant to talk about 2017 guidance on this call, but it would seem that analysts and investors have at least been interpreting some sort of message from you guys, given many EPS numbers have come down over the past month or so, and significantly more negatively, it would seem then, Jon, some of the messaging you've talked about at least on this call. So I'm trying to get a sense, especially with the Coty benefit or the share retirement benefit. So I'm trying to get a sense of a recap of your thinking on 2017 in terms of reinvestments and returns because clearly there are some messages being interpreted out there. And if you can balance the \"continued progress\" that your CEO says versus the not straight line that you mention and give us a little bit more color, I think it would be appreciated because there is some message getting out there, clearly.","The second question is, Jon, you joked a few years ago that you wouldn't want to be CFO of P&G at a time where the dividend didn't grow. And I think we're all collectively glad that it did grow. But can you give us some more color on the 1% dividend increase? Shareholders have been waiting around for you guys for quite some time. You've had some very challenging times. The macros have been very challenging. Others in your peer group suggest that they increased their dividend a little bit more aggressively than yours. And I get your dividend yield and I get your payout ratio. But what would in the end be the true cost of a slight ratings downgrade here to reward shareholders a little bit more aggressively? Thanks for those two.","Jon Moeller","In terms of the message that's being interpreted externally, I personally have a hard time sorting through that simply because of the very wide range that exists in estimates right now. So I'm not sure what message is being received. In terms of the message we're providing, it's very much the one you ascribed to David just a minute ago, which is continued progress on both the top and bottom line as well as our cash flow. And obviously, we want to accelerate all of that as quickly as we're able, but do it in a sustainable, responsible way. And as I indicated, we're just putting our plans together for next year, and we'll see what amount of progress we make.","Our competitors don't sit still. Markets are volatile, and so that's where the not straight line comment comes in. I just think that's a reflection of reality. The Coty benefit in terms of the share retirement will depend on exactly when those shares get retired, but there should definitely be a benefit associated with that, and we view that as part of the overall equation.","In terms of the dividend increase, as you know, we're very committed to the principle of cash return to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, as I mentioned earlier, we've returned $118 billion. This year between dividend and share repurchases and share exchange, we'll effectively return $15 billion to $16 billion.","There is not a lot of juice, if you will, to the amount of cash available from a borrowing standpoint between our current credit rating and one or two notches down. So to do that to the credit rating for a small amount of additional dividend increase is not something that made a lot of sense to us. We were very happy to increase the dividend. We remain committed to cash return to shareholders, but we also need to reflect reality in our dividend planning, significant FX headwinds. We are creating a smaller company, and our earnings per share are below year ago. And we have a responsibility there, as you'll appreciate as well. So it's a balancing of those two things. I completely get and understand the question. It's a very fair one, but that's where we net it out. I'll leave it there.","Jon Moeller","Thank you, everybody, for questions this morning. We'll be available for the balance of the week to talk through any of this with you. We're very happy about the progress that we're making, but we clearly understand we have more to do. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17488":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call August  1, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","AG Lafley - President and Chief Executive Officer","John Chevalier - Director, Investor Relations","Analysts","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Steve Powers - UBS","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble\u2019s Quarter End Conference Call. Today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. I am joined this morning by AG Lafley and John Chevalier. We will start our discussion with a review of fiscal year and fourth quarter results, AG will then discuss our going forward strategy and plans to strengthen our results, and I will close with guidance for fiscal 2015. One housekeeping item before we begin all the numbers we will be discussing today assume discontinued operations treatment for the pet care business, reflecting in our planned exit. Impacts of the move from operating results to discontinued operations were provided previously in an 8-K filing and are available online.","Now, on to results, we grew organic sales 3% in the fiscal year we just completed in line with median performance in our industry. We essentially held market share. Core earnings per share increased 5%. Organic sales and earnings per share results were both within our target ranges. In fact, they were both within the pre-Venezuela devaluation ranges that we established going into the fiscal year despite more than a 25% reduction in market growth rates from 4 points a year ago to 2.5 points to 3 points currently and significant negative foreign exchange developments versus our going in plan. Our productivity program, which we will talk more about later, was a significant enabler in delivering in this outcome.","On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew double-digits despite market growth headwinds. All-in sales grew 1%. All-in earnings per share grew 4%. We generated $10.1 billion of free cash flow with 86% free cash flow productivity. We increased the dividend 7%, the 58th consecutive year that the dividend has been increased. We have returned $12.9 billion in cash to shareholders, $6.9 billion in dividends, and $6 billion in share repurchase. About 110% of net earnings all-in. We made significant progress on productivity, operating discipline and execution. We delivered $1.6 billion of cost of goods savings, well ahead of our target run rate of $1.2 billion and ahead of our going in estimate of $1.4 billion.","We improved manufacturing productivity by over 7%, reducing overall enrollment while adding new capacity and new sites. We opened the first new multi-category distribution center in the U.S. with five additional centers slated to come online by early next calendar year. We continued to accelerate overhead reduction. In February 2012 we announced the targeted 10% reduction of non-manufacturing enrollment by June of 2016. As of July 1, 2014, we have reduced roles by 16% more than 50% ahead of the original objective two years earlier. We have made good progress driving marketing effectiveness and efficiency through an optimized media mix with more digital, mobile, search and social presence, improved message clarity and greater savings in non-media spending.","While acknowledging the progress I just described across cost of goods sold overhead and marketing you maybe asking yourselves, where have all the savings gone. In the year we just completed most went to offset FX. We have large leading positions in some of the markets where currencies have softened the most Japan, Venezuela and Ukraine and where our price controls are in place. Excluding foreign exchange core earning per share were up double digits. Partly as a result of devaluation we are seeing significant wage inflation in developing markets as much as 30% per annum, which we also need to offset. We are continuing to make targeted investments in innovation, trial generation and in selling coverage to drive growth.","In addition to productivity, we made good progress this year in continuing to focus the portfolio. Just yesterday we closed the Americas pet care sales to Mars. Mars has also chosen to exercise their option to purchase the Asia business which accounts 10% of sales. We are working the European pet transaction with a different set of buyers. We exited concierge health services business and MDVIP. We exited the bleach business and we divested several additional smaller brands Latin America Pert as an example.","Moving from the fiscal year to the fourth quarter organic sales grew 2% in a very challenging macro environment with decelerating levels of market growth in both developed and developing regions and intense competitive spending in several categories. Organic volume was in line with prior year levels, pricing added two points to sales growth. All-in, sales were down one point including the two point headwind from foreign exchange and a modest negative impact from minor brand divestitures.","Core earnings per share were $0.95, a 20% increase versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $0.04 headwind on the quarter. Excluding foreign exchange, core earnings per share grew 25%. This includes the 5 point benefit from tax and a 4 point benefit from minor brand divestitures. Core operating margin improved 170 basis points driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin was down 50 basis points. Cost savings were approximately 270 basis points were offset by product category and geographic mix, foreign exchange and higher commodity costs. Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales improved by 220 basis points, driven by overhead savings of 110 basis points, marketing efficiencies of 30 basis points and other SG&A reductions.","As we previewed in the last call non-operating gains from minor brand and business divestitures added approximately $0.03 to core earnings per share on the quarter. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 19% bringing the fiscal year rate to 21%, consistent with the outlook we provided in the last call. June quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, which include approximately $0.04 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.02 of charges from legal reserve adjustments.","In summary, we have just completed a challenging and tough but on-target year. We met our objectives, delivered double digit constant currency earnings growth, meaningfully advanced our productivity and portfolio focus agendas and built on our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. There is more work to do to deliver sustainable sales growth and reliable profit cash and value creation.","I will turn it over to AG to talk about strategies and plans to accomplish this.","AG Lafley","Thanks Jon. So that we are crystal clear, as John reported we delivered our business and financial commitments in 2013-2014, but we could have and should have done better. If just a couple of businesses that missed their going in operating plans had delivered, we would have achieved our internal leadership team goals of 4% sales growth, built modest market share, delivered 7% core EPS instead of 5% and 5% core operating profit growth instead of 2%. Despite all the market realities Jon described, country volatility, market slowdowns, currency hurts, customer and competitor challenges, the point here is delivering a better year was solely in our influence and control. So, while operating discipline and executional capability is getting better, a lot better around here, it must continue to improve to reach the levels of performance this company and our organization is capable of. We are increasing our focus on shoppers and consumers, they are the boss.","Everything begins with consumer understanding winning the zero first and second moments of truth and everything ends with winning the consumer value equation, consumer preference, purchase and loyalty. We are focused on creating and building consumer preferred brands and products that generate leading industry growth and value creation. This is how we will generate top tier total shareholder return. We need to continue to strengthen our brand positions, our product portfolio and pipeline and our selling effectiveness in the country\u2019s channels and customers in a way that maximizes shopper trial and regular purchase, drives brand and category growth and delivers more reliable value creation for customers, partners for P&G and of course for shareowners.","Today, we are announcing an important strategic step forward that will significantly streamline and simplify the company\u2019s business and brand portfolio. We will become a much more focused, much more streamlined company of 70 to 80 brands organized into about a dozen business units and the four focused industry sectors. We will compete in categories that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G strength. Within these categories, we will focus on leading brands marketed in the right countries, channels and customers, where the size of the prize and the probability of winning are highest with product lines and SKUs that really matter to shoppers and customers.","Why this significant strategic where to play change in brand portfolio? These core 70 to 80 brands are consumer preferred and customer supported. These brands are for the most part leaders in their industry category or segment, 23 with sales of $1 billion to $10 billion, another 14 with sales of $0.5 billion to $1 billion, and the remainder 30 to 40 with strong brand equities in sales of $100 million to $500 million. These brands are all well positioned with consumers and customers and well-positioned competitively. These brands have strong equities in differentiated products and a track record of growth and value creation driven by product innovation and brand preference. These brands are core strategic and have very real potential to grow and deliver meaningful value creation.","Over the last three years, the 70 to 80 brand portfolio has accounted for 90% of company sales and over 95% of profit. It has grown 1 point or 100 basis points faster than the total company and has earned more than 1 additional point of before tax margin. This new streamlined P&G should continue to grow faster and more sustainably and reliably create more value. Importantly, this will be a much simpler, much less complex company of leading brands that\u2019s easier to manage and operate. This simplicity will significantly focus investment and resource allocation and enable execution. We will harvest, partner, discontinue or divest the balance 90 to 100 brands. In aggregate, sales of these brands, has been declining 3% per year over the past three years. Profits have been declining 16%. These brands make up less than half the average company margin.","The strategic narrowing and refocusing of the brand portfolio will have a number of significant benefits mutually reinforcing. 70 to 80 brands will bring clarity, focus and prioritization and simplicity to a smaller more integrated better coordinated organization. The brand business units will be responsible for brand and product programs end-to-end down to the local country level. Selling and market operations will be responsible for customer and channel strategies (Technical Difficulty). I will continue. Selling and market operations will be responsible for customer and channel strategies for distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution for winning at the first moment of truth at the retail customer and distributor level. This focus on fewer core strategic brands will enable a strategic rationalization of product lines within brands and an even more significant pruning of unproductive SKUs.","As we rationalized business and brand portfolios, product lines and SKUs, P&G brands and products will be easier to shop and more productive and profitable for our customers, our partners and for the company. This focus on fewer strategic brands will enable R&D to focus product and technology development on more consumer relevant and impactful brand and product ideas. We have already started reallocating R&D resources and budgets, cutting out low value activity and doubling down on our most promising product innovations. This focus on fewer core strategic brands will importantly inform our supply chain transformation. We will now match manufacturing capacity to the brand portfolio and product lines. We will build distribution and mixing centers for only the brands and products we choose to sell. This should enable industry leading responsiveness and service to customers at lower cost throughout the value chain.","With this refocus on consumer and shopper preferred leading brands, we will be able to focus selling operations by retail, account, wholesaler and distributor, strategies, tactics and in-store executions that really make a difference. The same simplification and prioritization enables all our functions to provide the business units and sales operations better value-added help and support.","In summary, we are going to create a faster growing more profitable company that is far simpler to manage and operate. This will enable P&G people to be more agile and responsive, more flexible and faster, less will be much more. As a result of the company\u2019s strategic focus on its leading brands, we will both accelerate and over-deliver the original $10 billion productivity plan. While we are not going to publish or report specific endpoint savings numbers today, we will clearly over-deliver the original goals and we will update you on progress along the way.","In cost of goods sold, we are driving further and faster than when we established the original savings objectives. The annual manufacturing productivity improvements we are making and have made measured by the number of cases of product produced per person per year are well beyond initial targets that our process reliability and adherence to quality standards is resulting in less raw material and finished product scrapping. Increasing localization of supply chain is driving transportation and warehousing cost savings.","Earlier this year, we initiated what is probably the biggest supply chain redesign in our company\u2019s history. We are moving from primarily single category production sites to fewer multi-category manufacturing plants. We are taking this opportunity to simplify, standardize and upgrade manufacturing platforms for faster innovation, qualification and expansion and improve product quality. We moved to standard manufacturing platforms a little over 10 years ago in baby care. We are developing standardized manufacturing platforms for a number of businesses, fabric care, grooming, oral, and personal power to name a handful.","We are transforming our distribution center network moving from shipping products to customers from many ship points as if they were coming from different companies to consolidating customers shipping into fewer distribution centers. These centers are located strategically closer to customers and key population centers in North America enabling 80% of P&G\u2019s business to be within one day or less of the store shelf and the shopper. This will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels, while still improving service and on-shelf availability, efficient customer and consumer response and more importantly reducing in-store out of stocks. All of our new distribution centers will be up and running by early 2015.","To manage and operate the simpler brand portfolio, we have made several important organization design changes, move to four industry-based sectors, streamlined and de-duplicate \u2013 de-duplication of business units and selling operations, recombination of four brand building functions into one, reduction of hierarchy with all the sales operations and business unit leaders working together and working directly with Jon and with me. Each of these changes reduces complexity. Each creates clear accountability for performance and results.","We are just beginning to benefit from these opportunities to improve performance and reduce overhead costs that the organization changes create. We believe we have more opportunity to improve marketing effectiveness and efficiency in both media or non-media areas, while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and improving top line growth. When we get brand and product innovation right, source and sell brands and products effectively and efficiently we grow and we drive meaningful value creation. We generate higher sales and profit per unit which enables us to capture greater share of the value profit and cash where we choose to compete. It is this share of value the share of profit and cash that is generated that we really want to focus on and if we can disproportionately capture.","Today we have about 60 share of U.S. laundry market sales that earn approximately 85% of the profit and cash generated in the entire category, nearly a 70 share of grooming business worldwide and about a 90 share of value or profit. This disproportionate capture of category value is direct result and reflection of our business strategy and our business models. There has been some discussion in this context about whether premium price brands and products are still drivers of growth and value creation and I want to comment on this briefly this morning. We are shopper and consumer led. Their wants and needs come first. We meet those needs with differentiated brands and better performing products priced to deliver real and perceived consumer value.","In all four industry sectors and in most of our businesses there is as much and often more sales growth and value creation profit and cash in the premium and super premium segments. We have had some success in these segments. In the grooming market premium products generate about 43% of category sales. Gillette has an 88 share of this segment. Four years ago we introduced Fusion ProGlide priced at the higher end of the premium segment. Fusion grew global value share for 31 consecutive quarters reaching $1 billion in sales, faster than any other P&G brand or any other Gillette shaving systems in history. Fusion has been successful in developing markets which accounts for 25% of the brand\u2019s and product line\u2019s total business. In countries where Fusion has been in the market for several years it has earned value shares that rival those is the best developed markets. South Korea we have a 45 share and Russia a 33 share for example.","Last month we launched the newest product in the Fusion lineup FlexBall is the first razor designed to respond to the contours of a man\u2019s face maintaining maximum contact in delivering a close or more complete and more comfortable shave. End market go side - premarket men preferred FlexBall two to one versus the then best selling razor in the world our own Fusion ProGlide. FlexBall is off to a very good start and appears to be revitalizing consumer interest in the category. While it\u2019s only been available a couple of months we have seen a 30% spike in male razor category value in the U.S. and acceleration in cartridge sales and shares.","Crest 3D White premium oral care regimen was also launched in the U.S. and grew market share for 17 consecutive quarters, expanded worldwide and has become $1 billion business. 3D White has been an important driver of toothpaste market share growth in Brazil and Mexico adding about 0.5 of share in Brazil and a point in Mexico. We have recently launched 3D White in Spain, France and Australia. Early results are encouraging with growth in both category and our market share. In Western Europe the oral care category grew 3.5% in value this last quarter in the region where many other categories are declining 1% to 2%. 3D White is a big driver of that category growth. Following up on the 3D White launch we introduced Crest 3D White Luxe toothpaste and White Strips. The toothpaste removes up to 90% of surface stains on teeth in just five days and protects against future stains with a proprietary technology. The Whitestrips with FlexFit stretch and mold to your teeth for a custom fit. Tide, Gain, and Ariel unit does laundry detergents have been an innovation breakthrough, resetting the bar for delightful consumer usage experience, product performance and convenience in the laundry detergent category.","Tide Pods have priced at a 20% premium to base Liquid Tide and had grown to over 7% of the laundry category. In March, we launched Gain Flings, their version of Pods, priced at a 60% per use premium to Gain liquid detergent. Flings have already grown to nearly 3% value share, combined Tide Pods and Gain Flings now hold a more than 10 value share of the U.S. laundry category and over 80% of the unit dose segment.","We now offer this innovative product in over 50 countries. And several other markets including Japan and China, we\u2019ve recently launched single chamber unit does product setting the stage for future upgrades as the unit dose segment develops. In Japan, Ariel and Bold unit dose detergents are off to a strong start achieving a nine value share in just three months. Managing a brand and product portfolio is obviously a balance. In some categories where affordable pricing is more important part of the consumer value equation. We broaden our brand, product line, package size and price offerings to serve more consumer needs.","Bounty and Bounty Basic, Charmin and Charmin Basic, Pampers and Luvs, Tide, Gain and now Tide simply clean and fresh. While we will continue to compete with product innovation and brand differentiation, we will not allow ourselves to be uncompetitive on a consumer value basis and segments where we choose to play. There are times we must and will make appropriate pricing adjustments to remain competitive. We\u2019re doing this now, which you know on a targeted basis in U.S. Fabric Care and Family Care where competitors have been price discounting and promoting heavily since last calendar year.","In the end, we follow the shopper and the consumer. We meet their needs with consumer preferred P&G brands in better performing products, priced at a modest premium that delivers superior consumer value. We\u2019re currently entering the female, adult incontinence category. This is an attractive $7 billion global category growing at an annual rate of 7%. We\u2019re entering the category with consumer preferred superior performing products that deliver significant benefit advantages from Always, a brand women trust in prefer. We began shipments of Always, discrete in U.K. last month and we\u2019ll start shipments in North America and France over the next few weeks.","We\u2019ll be sending you more details about this exciting new product line from Always next week. In September, we\u2019re launching Crest Sensi-Stop strips. This is a revolutionary new product technology that provides the tooth sensitivity relief like never before. One strip applied for just 10 minutes, delivers immediately and up to one month of protection from sensitivity, pain for many consumers. We\u2019re setting the brand and product innovation agenda in our industry. When we do this well, we build consumer preference for our brands, extend the level of product competitive advantage, build brand and product consumer preference accumulatively overtime, and capture a larger share of category value, profit and cash.","The final area that will benefit from brand portfolio simplification is the consistency and quality of our brand building and selling execution. This execution is the only strategy our consumers and customers ever really see. We\u2019re bringing renewed focus to brands. When we get brands right, we deeply understand consumers and we create desirable ideas, iconic equities, and become a prototype in the category. We consistently express the brand promise with ideas that attract consumers to the product superior benefits to create trial, purchase lasting preference, and loyalty. This brand focus allows us to improve execution and build on those strategic brands to win ultimately with consumers.","We\u2019re also focusing selling resources to improve coverage, expertise, and execution in key retail channels, wholesalers, and distributors. This should lead to improve distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution to win consistently at the first moment of truth. We are and we will continue to increase coverage, sector and category dedication of our sales force and merchandisers in the store. I am excited by the opportunity to further elevate brand and selling execution and feel very strongly these efforts will be enabled by the portfolio focus we have embarked on.","I am working directly the sector and SMO leaders on these opportunities to profitably accelerate top line growth, while Jon and the team continue leading the work on portfolio simplification and productivity. This portfolio transformation may take a little more time than any of us would like because streamlining the brand and product portfolio will be governed by our ability to create value on every exit. When we get there to our in effect P&G new-co with the streamlined 70 to 80 brand portfolio, this will enable faster and more sustainable growth and more reliable value creation through the end of the decade and beyond.","We will be a simpler, faster growing, more profitable company that is far easier to manage and operate. We will be a company of brands that consumers prefer and customers support, well positioned competitively. A company of brands simpler to source, sell and service. The streamlined company of leadership household and personal care brands will deliver more reliable value creation for consumers and customers, partners and suppliers and will deliver reliably and sustainably total shareholder return in the top third of our industry peer group.","I look forward to updating you on our progress when we meet for our Analyst Meeting here in Cincinnati in November. Now I will turn the call back to Jon to provide the details on our outlook for this year.","Jon Moeller","We continue to expect global markets in our categories to grow in value terms 2% to 3%. Against this backdrop we are currently forecasting fiscal 2015 organic sales growth of low to mid-singles. With this level of growth, we will maintain or modestly grow global market share on a local currency basis. We think this is pragmatic and realistic starting point for our fiscal \u201815 financial commitments. Pricing should again be a positive contributor to organic sales growth, though likely not to the same degree we have seen over the past several years.","Foreign exchange is expected to be a one point sales growth headwind. With this level of sales growth we are forecasting mid-single digit core earnings per share growth. We will benefit again from significant productivity savings, but like last year these will be partially offset by FX headwinds which won\u2019t annualize at current spot rates until the back half of the year. We have a few value corrections to make. We are also going to invest and consumer trial of preferred brands and major new product innovations that are in market and that are coming to market.","We will continue to make investments in innovation and go to market coverage in the fastest growing sales channels. Non-operating income and tax should be roughly in line with prior year levels. And we are targeting to deliver 90% or better free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion. At this level, share repurchase should net of option exercises contribute about one percentage of earnings per share growth.","On an all-in GAAP basis we expect earnings per share to also grow mid-single digits including around $0.20 per share of non-core restructuring investments. In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance we want to continue to be very transparent about key items that are not included. The guidance we are providing today is based on last week\u2019s FX spot rates, further currency weakness including Venezuela is not anticipated within our guidance range. We continue to monitor unrest in several markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. And we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina where pricing controls and import restrictions present risk. This guidance does not assume any major portfolio moves. We will update guidance as these occur.","Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation of market growth rates. There are a few things you should keep in mind as you construct your quarterly models, our toughest top line comps are in the first two quarters. The top and bottom line impacts from consumer value corrections will disproportionately affect the first quarter and the first half. FX impacts will not fully annualize until the back half and productivity savings will build as the year progresses. In summary we are pleased to have delivered an on target year on both the top and bottom lines, but realized there is more work to do. We are realistic about where we stand in the journey and are excited about the path ahead. That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides, which will be posted in our website, www.pg.com following the call.","AG and I will be happy now to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hi, gentlemen. Good morning.","AG Lafley","Good morning, Bill.","Jon Moeller","Good morning.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Hey, can you give us a timeline for the sales of those your 90 businesses that have been deemed non-core?","Jon Moeller","Well, as AG said in his remarks, the timing on this is going to be governed by our ability to create value, which we are committed to do as we exit this business as much as we have done exactly as we have done with the prior category and brand exits. And rough order of magnitude, this is I would guess, Bill, though I am not providing the specific guidance probably call it 12 to 24 months, but again, we are not going to be governed by timeline, we are going to be governed by value creation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher (JPMorgan). Please proceed.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Yes, thank you. Sort of continuing with this, one of the things you guys are working on is driving sort of more cost efficient structures and I guess how do you fragment some of these brand groups or is this I guess can you talk a little bit about how this is making the structure less complicated as you go to this many brand groups? And then secondly, as you look at some of the productivity efforts, can you talk a little bit about the focus on stranded overhead and do you feel like your recent productivity will allow you to eliminate some of the potential dilution from selling off some of these businesses? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So, John, first of all as we look at the portfolio in the way that AG described, we are really looking at it through a strategic lens and we are wanting to play in categories with brands, leadership brands that play to our strengths. We have talked before about the core capabilities that we believe we have as a company and very simply brands that leverage those capabilities have proven over time to sustainably create value. And those that don\u2019t fully leverage those capabilities on average, we have struggled with. And so part of this simplification if you will is just matching up our businesses with what we are good at and not having to struggle with some things that we are not as good at. So, that in itself is a big simplification. You can imagine going from a company of call it 160 brands to a company of 70 or 80 brands is in itself incredibly simplifying, the number of innovation platforms that we need to focus on, the number of manufacturing platforms that we need to focus on, the number of products that we need to sell to each and every customer and distributor. So, there is tremendous simplification that comes with this.","To your specific question of stranded overheads, it is our objective and expectation that we will use the productivity savings that are available both through simplification that comes from portfolio focus, but also the productivity savings that come through the organization structure changes that AG talked about to in effect offset the stranded overhead impact. There will be some dilution as these businesses go out just as there have been with businesses that we have been divesting. But it will be on that order of magnitude and it will result primarily from the loss of operating earnings of those businesses. We will take care of the stranded overhead.","AG Lafley","John, just a couple of additional points, I mean, this is the classic strategic choice. We want to be in the businesses we should be in, not the businesses we are in. Secondly, it is driven by shoppers and consumers in the market primarily. We are focusing on the brand and business portfolio in the four industries that consumers actually buy and prefer, right, that customers really support and can support, where we have very strong brand equities, where our net promoter scores are higher, where our brand positioning is well-differentiated and where the product performance delivers. So, it\u2019s very straightforward. And the objective is growth. The objective is balanced, profitable sales growth and much more reliable value creation, much more reliable generation of cash, primarily by cash and profit.","In terms of the organization side, it\u2019s going to get a lot simpler. It\u2019s already begun to get simpler. A lot this is already underway, but we just have real clarity about what a regional selling operation does and what a business unit does. And they are now connected with far fewer handoffs and we will continue to improve that design to further reduce the handoffs. And we are just going to be much more agile and much more adaptable in a much quicker inside, much simpler inside, so we can deal with all of the change and the pace outside. That\u2019s really the objective here.","Look, we had our last global leadership council meeting last week, okay, I don\u2019t know the number, Jon, what are there 30 to 40 people and go, okay we now have a lead team of about 10 of us. And basically the region leaders, the sector BU leaders, Jon and myself 10 to 12 of us, we meet more often, we work on the business, we get things done on a weekly \u2013 by weekly and monthly basis. So, we are just going to be more adaptable. We are going to be more agile. We are going to be more responsive. We are going to be able to make decisions a lot faster and turn the decisions into action in the market that really matters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays Capital","Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick things. First was just around any kind of tax implications or risks from selling businesses at a very low cost basis? And then the second was how do you think you will be able to kind of ensure you don\u2019t lose shelf space or facings as you divest or discontinue brands? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","On the tax question, Lauren, there will be some low business assets that will be part of the portfolio that\u2019s going to be disposed. We have done a pretty good job historically about managing that through tax efficient structures. Those do take time, which is what we are talking about when we say that value creation will guide the pacing of the exits. So, we will try to manage that as effectively as we can. AG, you want to talk about?","AG Lafley","Yes. I mean, Lauren, obviously we have anticipated the concern that you raised and a whole bunch of other concerns that we have to manage through the transition and through all the details of the execution, but I guess I just mentioned three quick examples. One, in the U.S. we started out with a laundry brand portfolio of 15 brands, okay. Today, we have a brand portfolio of 5 and over the decades, our share has increased. And as we pointed out in my prepared remarks, our share is approaching 60 again. And more importantly, our share of the value created in that segment is at probably the highest level based on our calculations ever. So, I think there is a lot of evidence in a number of our business categories that the shopper and the consumer really don\u2019t want more assortment and more choice, they want efficient consumer response.","If you just look at what\u2019s going on in the omni-channel and pure-play e-tailer environment with online shopping, we are doing a pretty doggone good subscription business. We are doing a good shopping list and automatic replenishment business, because in a lot of our categories, frankly, their low involvement and consumers want to keep their life simple and convenient. And having the leading brand, better performing products and a good value everyday helps them keep life simple and convenient. Two last very quick points, if you look at this company decade by decade at the end of the decade, all of our growth in value creation is driven by three things: one, we are able to grow and continue to create value from our core established brands and businesses going into the decade. Two, we\u2019re able to create, transform, or acquiring build at least one major new business. And three, we\u2019re able to move successfully in the new space.","Okay, whether that\u2019s developing markets or new channels or whatever. And I suspect in2021, when we look back at this decade we\u2019re going to see the same pattern. We\u2019ve done a lot of analysis that shows more does not drive growth and more certainly does not drive value creation, absolute last point and you will know this one as well our better than I. When the team sort of got us into the beauty and personnel care business between 2000 and 2007, we tripled the sales from whatever was under 7 to 20 plus, we quadrupled a profit and we did it on half a dozen brand businesses. Pantene and Head & Shoulders, Olay, and SK-II, and a trio of fragrance brands accounted for virtually all of that growth in value creation in an industry that\u2019s notorious for activity and complexity. So I just believe very deeply that we\u2019re picking our spots in these industries that played our strengths and our assets and we\u2019re going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Research","I had two questions. First, maybe for you AG, you said at the beginning that there were several businesses that missed plan during the course of the year. And I\u2019m curious whether that is \u2013 was predominately innovation at some short of expectations or misprice products or what the problems were and I think you said you feel more confident about your execution ability going forward. But may be specifically why is that, is it different people in charge or do you have a better sense of adoptability if things are going wrong. So, that\u2019s question number one. And then number two, Jon, your comments really surprised me, you said that for next year you only play in to maintain or modestly grow market share, which strikes me as a very \u2013 I don\u2019t know weak stands to enter the year, I mean, I would think with all the innovation and all your plan spending, you would have more confidence or more enthusiasm about your market share trends, thanks.","Jon Moeller","Let me take the second part of that question and then turn it over to AG. Look, we\u2019re trying to establish very realistic external guidance that frankly is reflective of the macro environment that we\u2019re in as reflective of what we\u2019ve proven ourselves capable of delivering thus far. We delivered 3% organic sales growth this year or forecasting low to mid singles next year. We delivered 5% core earnings per share growth this year or forecasting mid singles for next year. We share completely your desire to do better than that and as we proved that capability if and as we prove that capability guidance will reflect that.","AG Lafley","Wendy, on your first question, first to be very clear about what I said, it\u2019s just a couple \u2013 two businesses had delivered their operating plans. We would have achieved our internal goals of 4, 7, 5 operating, okay and generated of course even more cash, just two, okay. The issues were different in one business frankly, they let their pricing get out of line and the thing that was frustrating about it is, it was out of line and for whatever reasons, I don\u2019t feel like the team came to grips with that reality fast enough, okay? It\u2019s being fixed. It happened before in this category, we know how to fix it will get fixed. And ironically it was a business that had like a 10 or 12, your run of very strong balanced growth and value creation. In the other case, we got our nose ahead of the tips of our skis on an investment in a new line of brands and products. And we just need to get back to the discipline, okay, of testing and qualifying major investments that we are going to make. Hey, there is a lot of risk in the product innovation side. There is a lot of risk when you are making investments in the marketplace, but we try to and we have a track record of and when we are performing to our capability, we do a reasonably good job of testing things before we expand them. And we just got the investment way ahead of the actual results in the marketplace. Those are the two. The things I feel good about I should say is and my teams knows this is I actually feel very good that more of our businesses are executing better are sharpening their strategies and translating it into operating plans, and that our execution is improving. But hey, this is an intensely executional industry and we just absolutely we have to be at the top of our game all the time.","Jon Moeller","And just one more point on this. While we did have problems in a couple of businesses as AG described, we had many businesses that had the best year they have had in a long time.","AG Lafley","That\u2019s right.","Jon Moeller","So for instance our Duracell business had a fantastic year. Our salon professional business had one of its best years in quite a long period of time. So there are many more things working than not working.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. So A.G. on the portfolio rationalization, can you discuss why you are implementing it now, the strategy makes sense, but what\u2019s kind of change is driving you to undertake this now. You previously outlined that 90% of the business was core and you expected divestitures, I am assuming the brand rationalization announcement today includes those businesses you already expected to divest or should we look at this as rationalization on top of that. And then last just given the process will take one to two years, are you committed to staying on board as CEO for as long as at least the bulk of the brand rationalization process takes?","AG Lafley","Okay. Dara, stop me if I don\u2019t \u2013 if I don\u2019t capture all of your questions. Okay, last question first, the Board, I am serving at the pleasure of the Board and we are criteria driven, we are not schedule driven, okay. So obviously, I wanted to drive this strategy and accelerate it but that\u2019s totally driven by our understanding of shopper and consumer needs and wants and the realities, okay, of the marketplace whether we are talking about channels and customers whether we are talking about competitive factors or whatever. So this is purely consumer market and competitive driven strategic choice.","Second thing is we are already underway, okay. So this is a continuation in acceleration. I mean we are underway on the portfolio pruning I just want to accelerate it, okay. We are underway on the organization redesign, I just want to accelerate it. We are underway on the major restructuring and productivity savings that were announced 2 to 2.5 years ago. I just want to get it to a logical end point for the first phase, so that we can focus on operating with excellence and growing this business and performing at our peak. And I am sorry the third part of the question was Dara remind me.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Just why now specifically, I mean it makes sense but what drove you to make the change at this point?","AG Lafley","Okay. Look, in an ideal world, okay, in an ideal world we would have done this at the depth of the financial crisis and recession. That would have been the perfect time to do with, if you think about it, right, dramatically focus, dramatically simplify. Get the cash flowing right and then once the bank is full, bide your time until the market starts to come again, right that would have been perfect, right. If we work Monday morning quarterbacks I could look over the last 40 years that would have been the perfect time. But I missed. We missed some of that opportunity. And frankly when you are in the middle of a financial crisis when you are watching oil approach $150 a barrel and chaos is reining around you in the biggest recession since the 30s you always \u2013 you don\u2019t always have the time to think through or the resources to act on a transformation of this seismic scope.","But having said that, I don\u2019t see any reason to wait, I don\u2019t see any virtue in waiting another minute. And I guess the last thing I would say is just think about what we are going to undertake. I don\u2019t want to go out and spend $1 billion round numbers on totally redoing the sourcing and supply chain in North America and do it for the wrong business shape and size that would be a terrible mistake, right. So in a lot of other places we are making investments that are going to make this company stronger, help us operate better etcetera, etcetera. And we have to make sure that we are doing this for the business that we think we are going to have and we think we are going to run for at least the next five plus years or so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Can you talk about what other strategies you considered, why is this the right strategy and why doesn\u2019t this at least in the interim take some focus away from fixing issues in the 70 to 80 brands that you are planning on keeping?","AG Lafley","I don\u2019t see any trade off there Olivia. In other words, we will have more talent, more resource in our financial and people against the 70 to 80 brands. So I mean we are \u2013 we have been all over several of those businesses. And frankly I am involved with 10 to 15 of them working with the leadership team. So I don\u2019t see any trade off. Now I won\u2019t tell you that there \u2013 that we haven\u2019t taken on extra work for another year \u2013 year and a half maybe at most for parts of it. As Jon said maybe the last disposals are as far as 18 to 24 months away. But now job one is to take care of shoppers and consumers, work with our customers and suppliers and deliver the operating plans and commitment on the 70 to 80 core brands that make up the portfolio that\u2019s going to drive this company ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Thanks. AG you highlighted P&G following the consumer as it relates to innovation at the premium side of categories and at higher price categories and I think you called out the success of innovation in high end laundry as an example. Now I understand like you don\u2019t report laundry standalone, but fabric and home was up 1% organically, the Nielsen data in the U.S. shows share erosion even following the launch activity obviously there was a lot of competition there with lot of deep discounting, you responded that your own deep discounting, I guess is this an anomaly what\u2019s happened in this category like how do you reconcile that the view that innovation is successful at the high end at least in this category?","AG Lafley","Okay. Chris let\u2019s go through this one in some detail because I think it\u2019s instructive. And if you have the patience we will go through one or two others because I think they are instructive too. I would like to just take U.S. laundry and let\u2019s go back to about a year ago in early September when we were at Barclays. And you may recall that we announced a series of fabric care category brand and product innovations that would be coming to market in the middle or end of the first quarter of 2014. I think we said at that time that they included the extension and expansion of our Pods product innovation to Gain and Ariel and two other countries like China and Japan which I spoke. We announced strengthening of our heavy duty liquid product offerings the so called value added offerings to meet consumer needs that were unmet and we announced the introduction of Tide Simply Clean & Fresh to meet unmet consumer needs and mid-tier segment and category.","I think at the time we pointed out that virtually all of the category growth and most of our P&G sales growth and value creation would come from the Pods and the value-added, heavy duty liquid, brands and product lines. So, let\u2019s look at when happened, while in September and October, the media and many of our analysts commented on the program, and 95% of the commentary was on Tide Simply Clean. In October, November, and December, our three main economy competitors all unleashed a series of essentially price rollbacks and price discounting and temporary promotion after temporary promotion, all of which has continue to present. We started shipping in mid to late February. And frankly, we couldn\u2019t keep up with all demand of customers. So, we were probably well established in stores that retail by March and the beginning of April.","Now, let\u2019s look at what\u2019s going on with the market shares, week-by-week from let\u2019s say the time that we really got established by retail. Well, lo and behold, we\u2019ve increased market share every week, okay, and if you look at our past 52 week share and compare it to our past four week share were up a full share point. Now, what else went on in the market, well, with all of that spending by the economy players, they essentially took dollars out of the category, which concerned some of the retailers and basically they traded cases, dollars, and share and made less profit on the ones they trade it. So, yes, there was a winner in that group, but they were also losers in that group.","I think there is some indication. We think there is some early indication that may be we\u2019ve reached the point where it\u2019s pretty clear about what the middle and premium part of this category is going to look like and what the economy part of this category is going to look like. And then if we turn to Tide Simply, I think we said last September that the worst case scenario would be \u2013 we get a big share and we cannibalize from ourselves. While we\u2019ve gotten a medium size share frankly about what we thought it might be and we still don\u2019t know where to land up because it\u2019s still only got 50 plus percent retail distribution and relatively low travel rates among its target, but over 60% of it has been net extra to us. So, I don\u2019t look at this week versus the same week year ago. I don\u2019t look at this quarter versus the same quarter a year ago. I look at shares overtime. We\u2019re on our way, we think back to 60 a share, we have only had 60 a share of dollars a few times in the history of this company and in fact peak, it\u2019s not a 62 to 63 when one of our principle competitors withdrew from the market back in 2007. But we have a higher share, the higher share we\u2019ve ever had at the value created. So, that\u2019s how we think about it. I know I\u2019ve gone on a bit, but I just want to mention a couple of others so that you get the point.","We didn\u2019t talk about at this morning. But in our diaper business in the U.S. and North America, we\u2019d rather quietly move back to share leadership, which we lost 20 years ago when our competitors brought training pants to market and we recaptured it in the last 18 months and we\u2019ve opened up a spread of almost 6 share points on diapers and I think a couple of share points plus on the whole baby care category that counts wipes and some of the other product lines. But how do we do that, okay, how do we do that without pants? Well, we did it because our baby stage of developments line of product and particularly Swaddlers which is unique consumer preferred etcetera has just cumulatively year-after-year slowly, but surely increased its trial, increased its share and is now just in and of its own right, a $600 million sub-brand that we think, now that we offer Swaddlers on all sizes, now we are finding moms actually prefer the designs could become a $1 billion business.","So, my only point is I want to look at the cumulative impact of our brands and our products. Last point, in 2007, we introduced a novel totally new proprietary product and technology on Always. It was called Infinity. I think we weren\u2019t as clear as we could be with consumers about what the product was and what it did, but without boring you in all the details, it is a very unique ultra-thin phone product far and away the best absorbing. This past year, we had all kinds of issues trying to get a totally new technology in manufacturing process started up. We struggled as I said to connect with consumers, but this last year we did over $200 million on Always Infinity. We have now expanded into parts of Asia and parts of Europe. It represented 15% to 20% of our growth. It\u2019s a clearly superior product. Women who have tried it and purchased it are repurchasing it at a rate of 60% to 70%. So, I actually see across most of our categories, brands and products that are really unique and\/or highly differentiated that when properly presented to consumers when the values clearly explained and if they have a chance to try it, that we can drive a lot of conversion. And final point, I am not going to take you through the details, but virtually every brand and product line we sell even in the U.S. is dramatically under-tried, dramatically under-tried. So, we will be back at ensuring that consumers who are prospects for these brands and product lines have a chance to really try the product and give it a chance. Sorry, Chris, I went on a long time, but I wanted to make the broader point about brand differentiation, product superiority, and consumer preference.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Yes, thanks. Hey, AG, maybe you can just provide a little bit more context on the streamlined portfolio, will there be a geographic angle for this as well or is it just hey, these are the 80 brands that we are going to focus on globally, or if you look at it on India or Venezuela or Brazil, are there certain brands that maybe you will pullback from even though they are a global brand? Thanks.","AG Lafley","Okay. Understandable question, I am going to \u2013 hopefully, I will be able to answer this as clearly as possible. Remember, Nik, we are shopper and consumer driven. And that means where all of the shopping and consumption occurs locally. So, if and when we get this right, we will have the right mix of brands, product lines, and SKUs for China. We will have the right mix for Brazil. We will have the right mix for the Arabian Peninsula and Turkey. We will have the right mix for India and the sub-Sahara. Okay, so this is totally shopper and consumer driven. We looked at the real growth and value creation potential. And as I pointed out, these are brands that for sometime have not been delivering on that front, okay. So, yes, if we get this right, we will have the right \u2013 we will not be short of brands or products to win in any market we choose to compete in. And eventually, I think as you know, that\u2019s going to mean all the emerging markets of the world, because that\u2019s where the demographics will be driving us. That\u2019s where the babies are born. That\u2019s where the households form. That\u2019s where incomes are rising. So, we think this positions us just as well in emerging markets as it does in any developed market.","Jon Moeller","And if you think about the screen, we talked about earlier, Nik, which is businesses that play to our strengths. Typically, when we are operating the business that does play to our strengths, we can operate that business globally. And so this is not a \u2013 there is not a geographic frame to this. It\u2019s as AG said consumers, shoppers match with P&G strengths.","AG Lafley","Yes. And Nik, just one more thing, so again in our attempt to help everyone understand, in some cases, it\u2019s simple. We sell one brand name everywhere in the world, Pampers, Pantene, okay. In some we sell two, Always Whisper. In some of our lines in fabric, in home, in beauty and personal care, we sell what we call clone brands. Okay? So, the principal brand might be Rejoice okay, but we sell Rejoice under a different name, okay in individual markets, because that\u2019s sort of the history of the brand. We keep those brands, same in laundry, same in cleaning. So, we are very practical. We are very consumer and customer driven. And we worked outside in from the markets to our brands and then to our business categories and sectors.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Hey, guys. So, before I get to the question and I often hate doing this, but I think it\u2019s worth just a comment, because I have heard it from many investors. I am not sure you did yourselves many favors on the \u2013 in the press release not talking about the quarter really at all. So, we all got to Page 13 or whatever it was saying that there is some rounding and beauty was down three, but there is no explanation, I am not sure you did yourself any favors. So, just for the sake of it heard from a lot of people, want to put it out there. The question though more is around just again learning more about this very interesting structural change. So, it feels like I think most people\u2019s ingoing assumptions was 10% of the business that was going to be divested was going to be more along business segment lines. And now I think you are flipping a little bit and talking about it from a branding line. So, I want to understand that if that\u2019s true?","And then a few questions that come out of that. One is lots of changes and the rationale is focus, which I get, but where do you know where the right balance is? So, why isn\u2019t something even further like a bigger breakup not the right answer? How did you make that decision? And then also from a focus perspective, if these brands are going to sell, are about 10% of the sales, 5% of operating profit, can you give us a sense of how much of your time, management\u2019s time and resources were on those? And then last want to go back to a question from before, I give you another chance, if AG, the Board says we want you here through this 12 to 24-month period, big transition period, we trust you to do this, do you want to be there for that time? Thanks for all those.","AG Lafley","Criteria-driven, I am having fun. I am full of energy. I am 24\/7. So, that will take care of the last one.","Jon Moeller","If my e-mail volume is any indication, it just backs up what AG said, he is here and working hard.","AG Lafley","Second point, Ali, it\u2019s strategy first structure second, right. Structure supports strategy. Third point is ultimately it\u2019s about competitive advantage and value creation, right. So, we don\u2019t see \u2013 we see competitive advantage in multi-industry sector participation. We see competitive advantage in technologies that flow across categories and industries. We see competitive advantage in sourcing as a company and providing information and other services as a company and purchasing as a company. So, when we do the math on the value creation, we get to this choice, strategic choice, this set of businesses has the potential to be the biggest value creator, right, which should be in the interest not only of our company, but also of our shareowners. But yes, I mean, the balanced point is a very fair one and I am not going to tell you that any of us are good enough to get this precisely right. And you know what we will adjust as we go. I can\u2019t tell you whether a 50-brand company might not be a little bit better than a 70-brand company if you see what I mean, okay. The last point to your direct question is the management distraction is episodic intermittent and not the driver. The activity and complexity that clogs us up is the real issue, okay. Let\u2019s just take SKUs, okay. I don\u2019t know what the end result will be here, it\u2019s being worked business-by-business and iteratively, but believe me the SKU reduction will be a lot bigger than the 10% up to sales line or revenue line.","Let\u2019s take product lines, the same, okay. So all of the sudden, one of the reasons that a number of our businesses have performed better is because the businesses and the R&D team and I all sat down in July and we sat down several times since and we just pruned out the bottom 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% of the activity and focused on few others and that\u2019s accelerated better products to market. The businesses \u2013 some of the businesses that Jon mentioned in other businesses that did really well this last year didn\u2019t well because there were extremely focused. And the last point and I could use the whole bunch of different examples here when you\u2019re carrying the bag, I\u2019ll use the old metaphor, with all the P&G brands and product lines in it to distributor or wholesaler to one of our sophisticated retail customers believe me, it is a huge advantage to be selling fewer leading consumer and shopper preferred brands and product lines.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Thank you, good morning. I have a couple of questions please. AG, you mentioned, you emphasized really the importance of having the right balance between premium priced products on the one hand and affordable products on the other hand, where the consumer demands it. I was wondering in the core brand portfolio of 70 to 80 brands that you have identified now. Do you think that that balance is right at this point? And in other words, should the sort of negative mix effect on the top line going forward be less of a headwind once you\u2019ve gone through these various disposals? That\u2019s my first question. And then Jon, forgive me just for asking a financial question, but given your outlook for fiscal \u201815, you suggested that essentially the top line growth is going to be against tough comps in the first half and cost savings will build through the year? Should we therefore expect earnings growth to be sort of flattish in the first half and it all comes good in the second half? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","A couple of things and one on the expectation of the reduction and negative mix on the top-line as we go forward, that will in all likelihood continue. We\u2019ve been pretty clear about that. It\u2019s driven by disproportionate growth in developing markets, which we expect to continue and as we move consumers up those portfolios overtime that impact will lesson as developed market growth is reintegrated that dynamic will lessen, but it has been with us and we\u2019ll likely be with us for some period of time. On the guidance question, we\u2019re not providing quarterly guidance, but all dynamics that you talked about are the right ones. I think you focus on the right things and I\u2019ve encouraged you to follow-up with the IR team later today. And I\u2019ll let AG to handle the question on whether we\u2019re priced right broadly.","AG Lafley","Yes, Michael, let me try to make the couple of strategic points and then I\u2019ll try to give you some insight into where we think we are at this moment in time. The first thing is incredibly important and often not well understood and that is the issue in our industry in household products and personal care products is almost always consumer perception of value and value has different drivers in different categories and different brands. Price is one of them. Okay, price is one of them, but brand awareness and trial rates and household penetration, brand equity, okay, product performance also are incredibly important.","Second point, we have a huge opportunity to get a lot clearer with consumers about what the value equation really is. I am going to give you a specific example from Gillette. We talked earlier that we just introduced FlexBall and it\u2019s off to a good start. We will see how it does. Alright. We did pre-market research in a blind context, so they don\u2019t know what the brand is and the new FlexBall razor was preferred 2 to 1 by system users versus the best performing product in the market, which happened to be our ProGlide. We are now in the market four, six, eight weeks. We went out and did a 400 male person panel, where we asked them to use the new FlexBall razor versus whatever they are using today. So, we had disposable users. We had shave club users. We had system users. We had electric razor users. 95% of them preferred a FlexBall, 95%. Interestingly, a lot of disposable users by the way half of the world, okay, uses the disposable razor today. The interesting thing is disposable users often say they use disposables because they think it shaves just as well as a system, many of them have never used a system. And they think it\u2019s a better value. So, their first belief if they try and use the FlexBall, they see it is a totally different experience and result.","And then the second thing is when you ask them what they think the prices or the cost is or the value is, they always say it\u2019s way more expensive when we tell them. You can have a cartridge for $1 a week, they are astounded and then we show them the math. So, my only point here is if you just read the Wall Street Journal, okay or if you just listen to the anecdotes in the Street or if you look at the $50 for 10 cartridge pricing in some retail establishments, you may perceive that the price is high, but the actual price per use and the actual quality and performance of the use is better. And that\u2019s incredibly important.","Now, that the direct question, I said in my prepared remarks where in some businesses, where the price point doesn\u2019t matter or in fact a higher price point is better. I saw more SK-II when my price point is better. We sell a lot of Oral-B electric toothbrushes at very high price points and I could go on and on throughout our line. But if you step back and look at all of our businesses around the world, we are in the best shape we have been in three years in terms of our relative pricing. In other words, we have the smallest percentage of our total business that has a price gap and is losing share. And here is the important part. The three biggest opportunities are tissue towel in North America, which is Bounty and Charmin and laundry, which Chris asked me about earlier, all of which are being addressed, okay. Interesting point there on laundry is major retailers are sort of discounting Tide 15% to 20%. It\u2019s still a better deal for them, because Tide at a 15% discount is the higher price and generates more value for them than the balance of the category. Last point on this one, the number of opportunities we have, where we are priced low where we should be or mixing below where we should be are as large or greater than the opportunities we have to adjust our price.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Please proceed.","Steve Powers - UBS","Believe it or not a few more questions, if I could. First Jon, maybe I missed it, but did you offer any cost or timing estimates associated with the supply chain restructuring that you are undertaking. And then second taking a step back you are clearly making progress on the cost cutting especially in SG&A, but the top line continues to lag a bit, this quarter it does feel like you rounded up 2% organic growth in the quarter, so does it make sense to drop all these marketing efficiencies to the bottom line or should you be reinvesting even more aggressively. And then lastly maybe related to that, AG as you said it all starts with the consumer and you guys have been long known for leading consumer insight capabilities, so what specifically is the consumer telling you that you need to do better in the market that you are not doing and maybe you can just talk about that in the context of beauty for example? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","In terms of the marketing I mean we are perfectly happy to reinvest and are looking for opportunities to reinvest and feel that we can do that and continue to become both more effective and more efficient. We are going through a transformation in this industry that we want to take advantage of while remaining fully in front of consumers with our marketing efforts. And so we look at things like the reach, the frequency, the targets that we are reaching, the conversion rates on the messaging and that\u2019s much more important than actual dollars spent given what\u2019s happened in that industry. But you should not mistake this for a second as lack of willingness to invest behind smart ideas to build the top line.","AG Lafley","Yes. We are maintaining or increasing our investment in marketing that works and we are driving for savings and frankly non-working dollars or other efficiencies that you get from the move to more digital mobile, social, etcetera. On the consumer insight side that is the focus, the full focus of a lot of people in this organization. And again I think we had a lot of activity going on and we weren\u2019t relentless about digging, digging, digging for shopper insights and consumer insights. Very simple thing, the mindset at Gillette was to test the new system with system users. You sort of slap yourself in the forehead and say well, wait a second. Everybody grooms, some people do a clean shave some people do a sculptured groom in the face. Some people body groom. Let\u2019s first of all understand what the job to be done is. And then second of all let\u2019s make sure we are putting together instruments, okay and experiences that meet all the needs.","So I mean we are going to sell an opening price point disposable razor from Gillette at I don\u2019t know $2 to $3 and we will take you all the way up to $200 to $300 if you want to buy art of shaving product or a top of the line Braun product. Specifically regarding beauty, look here is the headline on beauty. In terms of value creation they were one of the better performing sectors this last year. Unfortunately it was a little unbalanced, too much of the value creation came from cash and profit improvement, although I will take it and there is a lot more there.","Secondly, the progress we are making, okay. The Old Spice and Safeguard some of the hair care brands we had \u2013 we showed some real progress on Pantene in a lot of important countries around the world, still not the progress I would like. In the U.S. we had a little bit of share pickup in the first quarter which excited some of our competitors and turned into a second quarter that was heavily promoted, but anyway we will get through that. But Pantene is growing very strongly in important places like Brazil it was growing in \u2013 sequentially in China, it\u2019s growing and in a lot of developed and emerging markets. And I can see the product program starting to come. Head & Shoulders has just gone from strength to strength. Herbal is growing again. Vidal is growing again in key markets. So I think that\u2019s going to come.","And then before the year was out, even on Olay which is still struggling we have some real encouragement in a couple of places. We had two of the top five new facial cleanser products, two of the top five new facial moisturizer products. And this line called Luminous is actually driving a little bit of share growth in the past couple of months. So, the bigger point, okay, the bigger point is the one you made, which is everything begins with shopper understanding and consumer understanding. And when we have it and understand it that informs importantly and allows us to do a much better job with our brand idea and our product pipeline and portfolio.","Jon Moeller","I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. I realized we didn\u2019t get to everybody. It\u2019s a cheap substitute, but I am available the balance of the day. Don\u2019t hesitate to call, John and the team, are here as well. And we thank you for your participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day."],"17539":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - CFO","Analysts","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call.","P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also, as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. I'm going to start with a brief review of the company's results for the October\/December quarter and discuss progress against our key strategic focus areas. I'll update our outlook for the fiscal year, including the impact of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and then we will open the call for your questions.","Results for the quarter were in line with our going-in expectations, and as a result, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal year objectives.","Organic sales grew more than 2%, an acceleration of more than a point from last quarter. Sales increase versus year ago in 14 of our 15 largest markets and in 8 out of 10 categories. This growth occurred against some significant headwinds. The U.S. still had pricing interventions reduced organic sales growth rate by about 30 basis points. There was also a 40 basis point impact from the combination of retail inventory reductions in the United States, and the impact from the Government of Algeria banning finished product imports into its markets, in total, about a 70 basis point headwind in the delivery of over 2%.","Organic sales growth was again volume driven, with volume also up more than 2%. All-in sales were up 3% including a one point benefit from foreign exchange.","P&G tracked channel market share trends improved modestly, 27 of our 50 largest category country combinations are holding or growing share, up from 22 for the same period last year. Of those where share is still down half of less than the rate of decline obviously a positive step towards returning to growth.","Ecommerce sales continue to be very strong, growing about 40% with 8 out of 10 categories growing market share.","Before I take you through the earnings per share results, which are also on target, let me step back briefly and outline the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We view the Tax Act as a significant advancement for the competitiveness of U.S. companies. When we started working in along with many others on tax reform, it was in large part a response to the previous administration stated desire to repeal deferral of U.S. taxes on offshore earnings and toll repatriation. This was the one element of the U.S. code that helped address the negative competitive aspect of the U.S.'s Global Taxation approach. So we were very concerned about its threatened repeal.","The other issue which concerned us was the U.S. corporate rate which had become one of the highest in the world. With the combination of these items, we were potentially looking at a 35% tax rate on global earnings due immediately, which was more than 10 points to as much as 20 points higher than many of our internationally domicile competitors. The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act addresses both of these concerns by reducing the tax rate on U.S. earnings to 21% and by moving from a global taxation regime to a modified territorial regime.","It enables U.S. companies to remain competitive globally which maintains and creates jobs in the U.S. It facilitates the free flow of capital. And the individual aspects of the Act will hopefully in many cases stimulate consumption, net a very positive change in our view.","In terms of the math, there are several pieces of this I think are worth walking through, I won't touch on every element, but I'll try to help with the largest ones.","As part of the Act, U.S. companies are required to pay a tax on historical earnings generated offshore that have not yet been repatriated to the U.S. with a 15.5% tax due on unrepatriated retained earnings that are held as cash or liquid assets and an 8% tax on earnings that have been reinvested for example into manufacturing or research facilities.","We are accounting for the entirety of this tax in the quarter we just completed as a non-core earnings charge of about $3.8 billion. There are several items which partially offset this charge, the most significant of which is a revaluation to reflect the new tax rate of a large net deferred tax liability position. The offsets bring the net non-core earnings charge down to a total of around $630 million. This is a non-cash charge; the tax on historical foreign earnings has been recognized now for accounting purposes, but will be paid as stipulated by the Act over an eight year period. So the cash impact will fall in future periods and will be more than offset by the cash benefit from the lower ongoing tax rate.","We will be truing up the one-time charge for any evolution and policy interruption as we complete fiscal 2017-2018. For example, just last Friday, the Treasury Department provided new direction regarding which exchange rate should be used to calculate the one-time tax on foreign earnings.","Now let me move to core earnings and cash impacts. There are two main core earnings benefits. First, is the lower rate on U.S. earnings of 21%. The second benefit is an even lower rate on royalty income that relates to U.S. Domiciled Intellectual Property. Most of our IP is held in the U.S. Overseas affiliates license this IP and pay the U.S. for its use. This U.S. income will now be taxed at an effective rate of about 15%.","The most significant core earnings offset is the inherent disallowance under the Act of previously available U.S. tax credits. With assumed immediate repatriation of foreign earnings for accounting purposes going forward, we will also be recognizing dividend withholding taxes, taxes levied by other countries as we repatriate cash through intercompany dividends. We recognize in these as current period liabilities in the period when earnings are generated.","There's a small negative P&G impact from the minimum tax on foreign earnings that is stipulated by the Act and there are other operating impacts which reduce the rate benefit. One example is the potential need to gross up reimbursements for relocation costs which under the Act become personal income to relocating employees. All told, the core earnings benefit of the Tax Act is about $135 million in the December quarter and for the fiscal year. The benefit will more than double to about $300 million in fiscal 2019 and double again to about $600 million per year on a going basis.","This phase-in of benefits reflects both the period of the fiscal year for which the new rates are in effect, and the amount of credit benefit that had been built into our base plans by fiscal year.","Last, but certainly not least, is cash, the cash benefit will be about $250 million this fiscal year, $200 million next fiscal year, and $450 million per year ongoing. The ongoing cash benefit is somewhat lower than the earnings benefit because of the cash payments for the one-time tax on historic retained foreign earnings which occur over the next eight years.","So those are the numbers in a vacuum. The most significant benefit, as I said earlier, of U.S. tax reform for P&G is the positive impact that has on our long-term competitiveness on the 60% of our business that's currently conducted overseas and the reduced barriers for capital flow across markets.","I'll talk the impact on earnings guidance and cash utilization subsequently in the guidance section of this update.","I'll go now to earnings per share results for the quarter. All-in earnings per share were $0.93. This includes $0.02 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.24 per share of non-core charges due to the Tax Act that we just talked about.","All-in earnings per share declined 68% versus the prior year. This comparison reflects the one-time tax charge in the current period and the very large gain from the beauty RMT transaction in the base period.","Core earnings per share were $1.19, up 10%. Excluding the $0.05 benefit from the Tax Act, core earnings per share were $1.14, up 6%. Foreign exchange added about four points to earnings per share growth and higher commodity costs were four point headwind.","Commodity prices have continued to move higher as the year has progressed approaching a $350 million after-tax impact versus year ago for the fiscal year. We knew we'd see higher pulp costs going into the year. These costs have continued to increase beyond initial forecast ranges with strong demand and some recent supply disruption. Ethylene, propylene, kerosene, and polyethylene and polypropylene resins have increased recently primarily as a result of the fall hurricanes in the Gulf, but also due to recent increases in crude pricing.","Delivery costs have also been rising as demand for drivers outstrip supply. As a result, core gross margin declined 80 basis points versus year ago. 150 basis points of productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds of 90 points from higher commodity costs, 70 basis points of mixed impact, 50 basis points from pricing primarily Gillette, and 40 basis points of reinvestment in product and packaging innovation.","Core SG&A cost as a percentage of sales declined 80 basis points driven by productivity savings of 40 basis points from the combination of reduced overhead, agency fee and ad production costs, and approximately 40 basis points of top-line leverage. As a result, core operating profit margin declined 10 basis points for the quarter, productivity savings were 190 basis points benefit within this. The core effective tax rate was 21% including the impacts from the Tax Act.","Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 91%. We repurchased $1.8 billion of shares and distributed $1.8 billion in dividends, in total $3.6 billion of value returned to shareowners this quarter.","Net pre-tax act core results in line with our going-in expectations and result with the Tax Act that are ahead. We continue to accelerate top-line growth, we're continuing to increase the number of major category country combinations that are holding or growing share, we're continuing to deliver productivity savings and strong cash flow.","I'm going to move now to progress against our strategic priorities. As you know, we've chosen to focus our efforts on daily use categories, where products solve problems and performance drives brand choice. In these categories, we're doubling down on meaningful superiority, products, packaging, brand communication, retail execution, and superior value in each price tier where we compete.","We've raised our standard for competitive advantage in each of these areas to drive market growth and market share. We're making progress against this new higher bar judgmentally achieving it across all five touch points 40% of the time, up from 30% last year. We'll make further progress in the back half of the year with a strong innovation lineup recently and soon to be launched.","I'll touch on a few examples where progress against the standard is driving both market and share growth. Fabric Care continues to drive category growth with four steps to the perfect wash. Reframing the category experience from laundry and fabric enhancers to four steps that are better together: laundry, liquid fabric enhancers, feeds, and dryer sheets. This initiative combines strong innovation across the forms and improved in-store execution, visually showcasing the better together product line up at shelf and online with renewed consumer communication. ","The U.S. detergent market continues to grow fueled by P&G and primarily by unit dose. New advertising, incremental distribution and in-store communication on the four steps to the perfect wash has driven fabric enhancer category growth to almost 6% with P&G growing over 10%.","We continue to strengthen our offerings to drive the fastest growing segment of the diapers category which is pants. This segment makes up 25% of the overall diapers category globally and is growing over 15%. The majority of the category growth over the next five years will be driven by the pants segment. Pampers Pants has held the number one global share position for 10 consecutive months, led by sales growth of 30% over the past 12 months behind innovation that has been brought to consumers across the world.","Olay in China achieved its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, delivering superiority across all touch points. We completely revamped our Olay Beauty Counselor program and upgraded the in-store counters with higher and tighter standards. A few months ago we launched Olay Cell Science, Olay's first ever Super peptide formula delivering visible skin transformation in 28 days. We've upgraded Olay packaging to prestige like quality and attractiveness.","Our fearless of age campaign with an empowering message for consumers has further driven consumption has contributed to strong ecommerce sales that are up 80% fiscal year-to-date and is growing Olay's market share raising our game in products, package, communication point-of-sale and consumer value all leading to strong double-digit growth for Olay in China.","Always Discreet has grown more than 20% reaching new record share levels across all markets behind the successful launch of Discreet Boutique Underwear that look, fit, and feel like real underwear. This superior product and strong in-store execution has driven discreet global value share above 11% up one-and-a-half points over the last three months. Boutique has reached 20% of our underwear business is 100% incremental to Always Discreet earning two share points where it is distributed.","In the U.S. the adult incontinence category growth both volume and value has accelerated since the boutique launch with boutique driving 60% of that growth.","We continue to develop new naturals offerings to increase the relevance of our brands and products with the naturals consumer and the increasingly environmentally concerned shopper, whether she is a millennial or a baby boomer. Meeting consumer needs related to sustainability and naturals is not new at P&G. Take laundry as an example. P&G was the first multinational company to remove phosphates from all laundry detergents without a compromising cleaning.","In 2005, we introduced Tide Coldwater to promote energy efficiency with a specifically formulated detergent that helped consumers reduce energy usage by up to 50% per load, while delivering against the superior performance expectations of Tide.","In 2011, we launched the ultimate detergent sustainability offering super concentrated single unit dose. Before the Tide PODS launched this segment made up 2% of the laundry category, it now represents over 15% of the laundry market and accounts for 90% of laundry category growth.","We're currently launching the three chamber unit dose product in both Japan and China.","Two years ago we introduced the first biobased detergent with the cleaning power of Tide in Tide Purclean with 65% biobased ingredients produced with 100% renewable wind power, electricity, in a facility operating with zero manufacturing waste to landfill. Today, Tide Purclean is growing over 50% four times faster than the natural detergent segment.","This year we expanded our biobased offerings across the detergent portfolio to include GAIN BOTANICALS and Dreft Purtouch.","We're doing the same in other categories. In late September, we launched Whisper pure cotton in China, our new premium pad with 100% natural cotton top sheet. Results are strong with sales double that of going-in expectations. We have launched additional feminine care natural test and learn offerings across key markets.","In Baby Care, we're entering the natural segment with an offering that will include diapers and wipes. Today this segment represents over 5% of category dollars and is growing double-digits. Early testing of the offerings show a preference versus other leading natural products and broad consumer appeal.","In beauty, we launched Herbal Bio renew last year made with a blend of antioxidants, aloe and sea kelp, and free of parabens, dyes, and gluten.","We launched Rejoice Micellar water in China, a non silicon shampoo and conditioner. This month we're launching Pantene Micellar to bring the same benefits of a gentle cleansing shampoo and conditioner that removes impurities with no silicones, parabens, or dyes.","We've also announced the acquisition of the Native natural deodorant lineup to broaden our antiperspirant and deodorants portfolio in the naturals segment.","We're making packaging more sustainable with projects that expand our use of post consumer recycle plastics. One of our first applications is using reclaimed beach plastic for Head and Shoulders bottles as supply of these materials grows we will look to expand their use to other categories.","In healthcare, we're launching ZzzQuil PURE Zzzs, a melatonin based sleep aid naturally free of artificial flavors, gluten, lactose, and gelatin.","Our supply network transformation further enables improvements in environmental sustainability as we move manufacturing and distribution closer to consumption.","Since 2010, we've reduced truck transportation kilometers by more than 25%. Over the same time period our plant sites have reduced water usage by 24% and increased our use of renewable energy to 10% with a goal of 30% in the next four years.","As we reported in our most recent Citizenship Report published in November, we recently achieved our 2020 goal of reducing energy consumption at P&G facilities by 20%, four years ahead of schedule and recently we set a goal for zero manufacturing waste to landfill from all production sites by 2020.","Annual sales of P&G Naturals and significantly more environmentally sustainable products like Tide and Gain unit-dosed detergents and Tide Coldwater are well over a $1 billion with many additional products just launching and more in the innovation pipeline.","Innovation drives superiority and builds brand relevance across age groups including millennials. Over the past year 13 of our leading brands were market share leaders among millennial consumers including Always, Bounty, Cascade, Charmin, Crest, Dawn, Dowty, Downy, Gillette, Olay, Old Spice, Swiffer, Tampax, and Tide. Millennials do a lot of their shopping online.","Last year P&G sales in ecommerce exceeded $3 billion. The goal this year is to build ecommerce sales to nearly $4.5 billion. Fiscal year-to-date our ecommerce sales growth is up nearly 40% with all of our top markets in 8 out of 10 product categories growing or holding market share. We're making good progress but we're not yet where we need to be in all categories and markets.","Mainline tape diapers in China are a challenge. We've made tough choices to improve our position in grooming. We face highly capable competitors who continue to innovate their products and business models.","Addressing these challenges and extending our product package demand creation superiority will continue to require investment which underscores the importance of productivity. We will continue to drive productivity improvements to lower costs and generate cash. As you know, we completed a $10 billion productivity program in fiscal 2016 and have doubled down another $10 billion starting next fiscal year.","We continue to progress our supply chain transformation. Next month, we expect to start production of the first of several categories at our new state-of-the-art multi-category manufacturing facility in West Virginia. The sustainability efforts I recited earlier obviously go hand in glove with our productivity efforts contributing significantly to reductions in costs.","We've been talking a lot about media transparency which has been improving. As this improves, it's clear and clear to us that there is more opportunity to eliminate waste by reducing excess frequency within and across channels, eliminating non-viewable ads, and stopping ads served to bots or adjacent to inappropriate content. Through these efforts we've been able to eliminate waste and cut losses, while simultaneously increasing reach the number of consumers we're actually connecting with by about 10%.","Looking ahead, we see further cost reduction opportunity through more private market placed deals with media companies and precision media buying, fueled by data and digital technology. We continue to reinvent our agency relationships consolidating and upgrading P&G's agency capabilities to deliver the best brand building creativity. We've already reduced the number of agencies nearly 60% from 6,000 to 2,500, saved $750 million in agency and production costs, and improved cash flow by over $400 million additional through 75 day payment terms.","In the next phase, we're targeting to save another $400 million reducing the number of agencies by another 50% and implementing new advertising and media agency models. We need the contribution of creative talent and are prepared to pay for that. We don't need some of the other components of the cost. We will move to more fixed and flow arrangements with more open sourcing of creative talent and production capability, driving greater local relevance, speed, and quality at lower costs. We will automate more media planning, buying, and distribution bringing more of it in-house.","We are focused not just on cost productivity but also cash. An important cash productivity project has been supply chain financing which we continue to expand. This program which is a win for suppliers and for P&G has yielded over $4 billion in cash in the four years we've been driving it.","Productivity improvements have been critical to offsetting the headwinds from foreign exchange and to increase in our industry-leading margins. Our aggregate 22% core operating profit margin is the third highest in the industry; we hold further advantages in below-the-line costs. We borrow at some of the most favorable rates in the industry and we have a tax rate that is among the industry's lowest leaving us with a second highest after-tax profit margin in the industry with three-and-a-half out of five years of the next productivity program still ahead of us. Productivity improvement will be critical to fund investments for sales and market share growth, while continuing to expand profit margins.","Alongside all the other work we continue to evolve our organization structure and culture. We're now about six months into the implementation of the end-to-end and freedom within a framework organization models, simplifying the structure and clarifying responsibility and accountability.","We're managing careers to increase mastery and supplementing our internal talent development system with skilled experienced external hiring. We are strengthening our compensation and incentive programs. We're increasing the granularity of bonus awards trying to put them much closer to the results individuals deliver.","Based in part on shareholder input, the board's compensation and leadership committee has modified the performance stock program to include relative sales growth metrics and a total shareholder return modifier to ensure awards reflect performance versus external competitive benchmarks.","David will talk more about each of these areas: superiority, productivity, organization and culture when we're together in a few weeks at CAGNY.","Let me move now to guidance for fiscal 2018. We're maintaining the organic sales growth guidance range of 2% to 3% which will require further top-line acceleration in the back half of the year in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace. We expect fiscal 2018 all-in sales growth of around 3%. This includes a modest net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures.","We're raising the top end of our core earnings per share guidance range shifting from a range of 5% to 7% to a range of 5% to 8%. We're raising the upper end of the range by a point to reflect the benefit from the Tax Act which I outlined earlier. It's not entirely clear what competitive dynamics are going to be in response to the Act. We're maintaining the bottom end of the range to reflect that uncertainty that still exists around these dynamics in our categories. We now expect the core effective tax rate on the year to be in the range of 22.5% to 23%.","Looking further forward, we expect ongoing core effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 22% starting in fiscal 2019.","As I've indicated earlier, the changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The charges we have booked for the non-core impacts and the core effective rate may ultimately differ from our current estimates and require true-up.","There is still potential for changes and regulatory interpretation of Tax Act Provisions. There may be legislative actions that arise because of the Act and our estimates of the impacts may change as we refine our calculations for earnings and exchange rates for our foreign subsidiaries.","Now as you think about top-line for the remaining two quarters, please remember that the Gillette price reductions won't anniversary until Q4. We're also facing several additional near term top-line pressures including the Algerian ban on finished product imports that I mentioned, and recent VAT increase, an increase in reduced subsidies for energy and utilities in Saudi Arabia, one of our top 15 markets which will pressure near term consumption as we have clearly seen in the month of January.","As you think about our earnings per share for the remaining two quarters, there will be little to no impact, little to no benefit from tax reform. The benefit from the phased-in tax rate will be offset by lost credits and deductions in higher interest and operating expenses.","On a before tax basis we expect much stronger earnings growth in Q4 than in Q3. Recall that the third quarter base period benefited from several non-recurring gains including the sales of an office building in Mexico and transition services income from the beauty divestiture. We plan to deliver another year of 90% or better adjusted free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales.","We will continue our strong track record of cash returned to shareholders. We expect to pay nearly $7.5 billion in dividends this year. We're increasing our fiscal '18 share repurchase outlook from a range of $4 billion to $7 billion to a range of $6 billion to $8 billion, reflecting strong operating cash flow, continued working capital progress, and the cash benefit enabled by the Tax Act. Combined we will return between $13.5 billion and $15.5 billion of value to shareowners this fiscal following $22 billion last year.","Our efforts to focus on strengthening our portfolio to extend our margin of competitive superiority to transform our supply chain to enhance our industry-leading margins to simplify our organizational structure and increase accountability are all aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom line growth that creates value over the short, mid, and long-term.","Our results for the second quarter were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the fiscal year.","As I just mentioned we're maintaining top-line guidance reflecting the help from the Tax Act and the guidance range on the bottom line and are increasing our share repurchase assumptions.","With that, I would now be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi good morning. Could you address the Baby Care business specifically, the weakness there surprised me because at least in track channels, your market share has actually looked pretty good. So I'm wondering number one was the weakness more international specifically can you talk about how the diaper launch is doing in China and what your plans are specifically in Baby Care to get volume growth growing again? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Sure, Wendy. Let me start with China. Our plans there behind the new initiatives are largely on track. We built share during the quarter in the Premium segment of the tape form and we continue to do very well both in the premium priced tier and the mid priced tiers with the pants business. We've grown from number five player on pants to the number one player on pants which is by far the fastest growing form of the category.","As you know in China, we had a large mid-tier business and that business is declining versus year ago. We've taken some actions recently to adjust the rate of that decline but we've made some specific choices in terms of putting our priority in those premium segments and in the pant segment which are growing real faster over the long-term and are more profitable.","In the U.S., as we've talked before which is obviously the largest market for us in diapers along with China, there continues to be significant retail competition which is forcing prices down to consumers while that doesn't change the price that we necessarily sell products through to these retail channels it starts driving price points in the marketplace lower which affects businesses like Luvs. So Luvs has much more competition than it has historically had and that's been coupled as well by strong pricing, strong price points on the behalf of branded competitors. So we've made some changes in our Luvs pricing as well to respond to those realities.","We have a pretty exciting second half in terms of innovation in Baby Care. I talked during the call about the Pampers Pure launch which we're very excited about and we're continuing to drive innovation in the Pant segment across the world. So work still to do, I think the China dynamic will remain with us for some time, we will continue to grow faster at the top end in pants. Over time, offset in mid-tier particularly with some of the actions we've taken will diminish. We hope to be growing that business by the end of the fiscal year and clearly we hope to be growing Pampers on a global basis as we complete the year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Good morning, thanks. With respect to the tax benefit in the past you said you aren't suffering from a lack of ideas. So I\u2019m a bit surprised that you're increasing the share repurchase plan. So as you think about it what sort of the plan longer-term for some of the benefits that you get from a lower tax rate because as I think about where you could potentially put that and price actually turned negative for the first time in a while, so you're not under investing in price and then also within that, I'm just curious where M&A potentially fits in as well? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Olivia. We've been very clear about our intention to invest in superiority across the five touch points which we talked earlier today. That's primarily going to be focused on product, package, communication, and in-store, but where we need to sharpen value equations either at the consumer at the retail level that could also be a target for investment.","We intend to continue to keep the bottom-line growing and to be growing margins through productivity which will both provide the fuel for reinvestment and for margin improvement. We really, as I've talked about many, many times before don't view pricing and promotion as high on the list in terms of our options to grow the business.","We'll do it when we need to do it but there's nothing proprietary in promotion, there's nothing proprietary in price. We would much rather invest in items that where we can derive proprietary benefits over long periods of time.","You mentioned the price impact on the quarter, we've held or grown price inclusive of promotion for 28 consecutive quarters until the one we just completed and for 13 consecutive years. So the preponderance of the evidence in terms of our intentionality around pricing remains. Most of the impact in the quarter we just completed was Gillette which as you know, anniversaries itself in April. And then I talked as well in the answer to Wendy\u2019s question about the pricing that we've taken on Luvs.","But generally we're going to be continuing to invest in the business, driving superiority, driving sustainable competitive advantage, doing it in a responsible way, driving margin simultaneously.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks, good morning. Hey Jon going back, could you just talk a little bit more about the impact in the quarter on growth, I think you talked about a retail destocking in Algeria, just maybe a little more color on those two issues. Would they have any impact as we move into 3Q or 4Q and do you see any other especially on the inventory destock affecting 3Q or 4Q?","Jon Moeller","Sure. So the first thing we mentioned was the pricing impact for Gillette which as you know will roll off in Q4 and that was 30 basis points of impact within the quarter. It would still be with us next quarter but then it will anniversary itself.","The second thing we've talked about was 40 basis points impact of U.S. retail inventory reductions. And I obviously won't get into specific customers but in one of our large customers for example spell through another words sale of their products in P&G, P&G Brands was up 1% in the month of December sales to that customer were down 3.5%. So you see a significant contraction in inventory that's happening there and we're seeing that fairly broadly across the board. We expect that will continue into the next quarter because most of the retailer's fiscal year ends are in January. Obviously that's not a well that's I wouldn't expect that trend to disappear, it's not it's largely a one-time item and shouldn\u2019t be affecting us at that level of magnitude going forward. So there should be some pickup there.","The Algerian situation isn't a retail inventory situation, it's a government regulation situation where they have forbidden the import of finished product in our categories and most of our business in Algeria supplied through import. We expect that situation but we're obviously working many alternatives and working very productively with the authorities but we expect that to continue to be a constraint in the third quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Great, thanks good morning. Jon I was hoping you could just unpack the negative margin mix a bit more in the quarter with China presumably better, Skin Care, SK-II better, baby worse are expected out of expected margins should be a bit better? Grooming declines notwithstanding. So could you just I guess elaborate on where the incremental mix headwinds are coming from perhaps as it relates to the U.S. inventory reductions but I'm just really trying to understand how mixes could evolve over the balance of the year and I guess above and beyond that whether what you called out as negative mix is maybe better described as another form of reinvestment above and beyond the pricing adjustments and the investments in innovation that you've mentioned. So just I guess in a nutshell where is the negative mix coming from and how is it likely to evolve from here? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Sure, Steve. The simplest way to think about it is at the level of geographic mix. We delivered over 2% organic sales growth on the quarter. The U.S. was about 1%, slightly over 1% with the balance obviously growing faster than that and as you know our margins in the U.S. are much higher than the balance.","We expect in the prior question I talked about, most of those headwinds being U.S. centric i.e. Gillette pricing and the retail inventory reductions. So we would expect absent any other changes to accelerate our growth rate in the U.S. in the back half which should mitigate may not eliminate but mitigate the margin difference.","Remember historically whenever we've been in a position where the balance of the world is growing at a faster rate than the U.S., there typically is a negative some element of negative margin mix.","Now we're working hard obviously from a productivity standpoint and in pricing where it's appropriate behind more superior offerings clearly doing that in China to mitigate that impact going forward. But in large part it was for the quarter geographic mix.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Gillette innovation. I'm more surprised there is kind of no mention of it, so a lot of new products are unprecedented coming to market, if you could talk a little bit about retailers to port marketing plans when we should start to see that and particularly in terms of retailer anyone that's particularly getting behind it and what we should be watching for? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So first of all, let me just talk about the business in total in the U.S. in grooming, generally the intervention plan that we've put in place is working very well. We grew volume for the third straight quarter on the U.S. male shave care business, quarter we just completed volume was up 6% for the category with male shave up 8% and the volume share trends are also improving with share growing 0.6 points in the last quarter.","We've just brought the new items to market and are beginning to the commercialization activities behind them; retailer uptake on those items has been encouraging, but really nothing to report from an off-take standpoint yet.","Operator","Next we'll go to Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi guys. So I wanted to go back to pricing again and I totally appreciate we got to see the 28 quarters of flat to positive pricing. But the pricing trend has clearly been a bit downwards and arguably you've been pricing below your combined kind of market inflation rates for years now? And then of course this quarter is a negative price, while commodities are going up. And so this kind of pricing down and commodities up to be fair, isn't inconsistent with what we're seeing from your competitors either right, so I'm not blaming you just to be clear at least not this time. Your CPG pricing not keeping up with inflation seems to be kind of the trend now. So I'm trying to get a better sense of from an industry perspective as you guys see it, what's driving that, I mean is it the retailers especially in the U.S. really pushing back, is that the consumer saying gosh these are commoditized. Is it fragmentation or commoditization it's going to be combination of those but if you can elaborate and do you kind of think that's the new world we're living in here that's the new reality for CPG that that investor should be concerned about pricing power much less than it was before or do you think this is a transition and we're just going to get through this and everything's going to be fine later on. So thank you for that.","Jon Moeller","Sure. There is a lot within that. Let me go piece by piece. As it relates to the relationship between pricing and commodities, well commodity costs are increasing and they are clearly affecting both our gross margin, our bottom line as we outlined. They have not increased to the point where typically pricing can be taken and hold and held. We're still at a point where if we were to reflect the commodity costs and pricing they would result in price increases that would be relatively modest and that typically wouldn't either A be followed or B be pass-through on shelf. So that's part of the dynamic that you're seeing there and I would assume that's true for other companies though that I won't -- I won't comment on that.","In general, slow market growth which we currently face also leads to more competitive behavior in terms of pricing. And that's why in many -- in many ways we've chosen to focus our portfolio where we have which is in categories where performance drives brand choice and why we're doubling down on advantage within those categories to ensure that that performance advantage is clear and noticeable to consumers.","We see in many parts of the world, including the U.S., including China, significant growth still at the high end of the market and many categories more growth at the high end than in the low end. So I think you're absolutely right to point to this as a pain point kind of in the immediate present. I think our strategy is designed to find the best path to a better place which is higher category growth driven by products that deliver higher benefit for consumers and I don't see pricing as it's having gone through the sea shift that should reflect your view on the industry long-term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey good morning. So Jon, if you look at divisional profit ex-corporate expense, it was flat year-over-year in Q2 after a decline in Q1. As you just talked about pricing was negative in the quarter for the first time in more than seven years, so I think commodity pressure as you look going forward you guys have spent a lot of time, money and effort in turning around market share and driving improved performance there, is there any shift going forward in terms of how you drive profit growth. Any strategy tweaks in terms of accelerating cost cutting, taking greater pricing et cetera, how should we think about sort of the balance between market share focus and profit growth going forward?","Jon Moeller","We believe as you know in a balanced approach, we think it's the only way to sustainably build value in this industry over periods of time, we need to be growing our top-line both our markets and our market shares. At the same time, we need to be growing margin.","These strategic initiatives and focus areas that I talked about earlier both productivity and the doubling down on competitive advantage and superiority both works in our favor in that regard going forward. So everything that we're doing as I mentioned in the prepared remarks is designed to drive both in a balanced way. We have more work to do as your question obviously points out, I mentioned for example going even much further in the area of advertising, strengthening our programs, increasing reach, but really making a serious effort to eliminate costs that just aren't serving anybody's purpose in that space.","We're doing that across the income statement, across the balance sheet, but it continues to be a very, very significant focus.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you, good morning. I have a question on your market share Jon, it does sound like broadly your market share losses continue to persist. So could you update us on your thoughts as to when you expect to stabilize your shares and then ultimately to increase them, is it realistic to expect to see this by the end of FY '18? And then you did talk a lot about continued investments, so it does seem like you need to increase investments in R&D and then advertising to begin to gain market share and just if that is in fact true, could you just give us a sense to the expected increases for both? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","We did increase advertising in the quarter to be clear, we're up about 2%, I continue to expect that we're going to be investing in both R&D and advertising, we're obviously just constructing our plans for next fiscal year. So I don't really have any specifics to share with you there. But its part and parcel of again a very focused around on daily use categories more performance solves -- drives brand choice and product solve problems. We want to be in a superior position both from a communications standpoint and from a product efficacy standpoint in each of those. And as I've indicated, I do believe that our productivity efforts give us the ability to do just that while simultaneously building margins.","In terms of market share, we expect to be growing, if you just look at the guidance we've delivered call it 1.5% organic sales growth to-date to get to the 2% to 3% guidance range for the year requires acceleration in the back half. Our markets are growing about 2.5% on an average, so we would expect to get there in the back half of the year.","Obviously though what you're going to see which you're painfully aware of may look something somewhat different than that not in terms of aggregate results but in the track channel numbers simply because there's so much more growth occurring in the non-tracked channels where we're building a disproportionate share.","But of course we our objective is to hold and build share in all channels.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks, good morning, Jon. I wanted to pick up on the last question with respect to category growth which it sounds like you still expect 2.5% so that's unchanged in the prior call? Could you talk a little bit about emerging markets broadly, it sounds like some of your competitors are talking about perhaps we found a bottom here if not some slight improvement but that doesn't sound like your expectation. So maybe you can talk a little bit about that and then just secondarily do you expect any benefit from a consumer perspective with respect to individual tax rates moving lower and given the company's premium SKUs. So any commentary there would be helpful? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Sure. If you look at developing market category growth, it's around last quarter was around 5.5% and that's up a little bit, we saw an increase an uptick in December. We saw the same thing in developed markets. So I'm hopeful though I don't have any kind of a crystal ball here in front of me that that maybe we have seen the nadir in terms of market growth rates.","With the growth of the global economy is pretty much everywhere which of course can come unhinged at any moment. That also bodes well but we're basically forecasting market growth in line with most recent history i.e. the last couple of quarters and will be beneficiaries if it comes in better than that. But I don't get too excited obviously over a move in one month i.e. the month of December but if you had to state the future on that one month, it is a slightly better picture than I've done the case previously.","Obviously to the extent that disposable income increases as a result of the Tax Act for some consumers, we would hope that that plays through into higher consumption and we do think that that there's a chance we could disproportionately benefit from that given as you rightly point out that many of our products do require slightly higher outlay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning, thanks very much. It\u2019s with great reputation that say I\u2019m following up on Ali's question but going after pricing a little bit, I wanted -- you look at your strategy it seems to be kind of somewhat of a counterpoint to a strategy that's prevalent in food and particularly 3G and Kraft Heinz, which has been whole wave. Many other areas are staples too. You could look at and Anheuser-Busch taking price at the expense of volumes, segmenting the market reaching more for premium consumers and trying to get people to pay more and there is a lot in there, there's relationship with retailers. Why I ask right now is this segmentation which it appears to be in U.S. grooming seems to set you up to do something like that in that particular category and I'm wondering if that's a fair interpretation where you can now maybe price a little bit better, it may reach and try to grab more of that value to consumers presumably you're bringing a lot more value to and are there other pockets of your maybe portfolio where similar strategy is warranted or maybe I'm even off base in interpreting that way? Any comments you have would be helpful on all those lines. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","I don't think you're at all off base and again our strategy which focuses on building advantage should allow us to do exactly which you described and you see that playing out through many parts of the product portfolio. If you just look at some of the examples we talked about earlier that's Tide PODS or scent beads or dryer sheets those are all premium offerings on a price per use basis. The same is true with the item that we're dramatically changing the category growth rate within adult incontinence which is this new boutique underwear, I mean that's a clear move to further capture more value in the category.","So the strategy sets us up very well to do exactly what you describe we need to do it in an intelligent way, we need to do it in a way which builds value for shareholders, the combination of price and performance and we'll continue to get out that. I mean you don't build price for 28 consecutive quarters and then walk away from it, that's not we're headed here but there will be times when again in response to other moves that have been made, we need to maintain our competitiveness in the market and we're just not going to accept significant share loss from not doing that.","Operator","Next we'll go to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good morning. So Jon, I just want to go back to exactly this question. And just to balance the top-line growth and the margin and can you please comment on the additional cash investments on that line on pricing and price mix. From your new EPS guidance that now includes a much lower tax rate, it seems that you became more conservative on how the cost saves will flow into the bottom line. So especially in the core operating margin perspective as you take out obviously as you decompose your guidance, is that a reflection of this competitive environment U.S. Baby and the destocking from retailer that you just mentioned, so or EM is taking longer to show results despite a pickup in beauty. So I just want to -- so I just want to think about strategically as you step back and you're going to invest more in prices in other categories should recovery share besides what you did for grooming and Luvs. So wanted to kind of elaborate more on that? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","First of all any Tax Act related impact is future focused, this is only effective as of January 1st and we're sitting here today talking about results through December 31. If you just think about where we've taken our guidance as a result of the tax change, we took it from 5% to 7% to 5% to 8% up so there is no change in terms of the inherent amount of reinvestment that's planned.","All we've changed in our guidance number is reflects the fact that there's a lower tax rate. Our strategy has not changed in terms of how we intend to compete, how we want to be building markets not diluting markets, nothing there has changed. Broadly the competitive environment is not significantly changed.","I mean for example just look at private label as a metric as to whether there's a big trade down that's occurring within the consumer set, private label last three years in Europe has been flat as a pancake. That's the largest private label market in the world, there are categories where it increases from time to time but generally we're not seeing a reason to chase lower prices as a result of private label.","In North America, over those three year periods private label is up 0.2 share points, it's up in three categories currently and in two of those categories we're building share. So I do not see, I do not expect at all a change in our focus and strategy to deliver value accretive offerings which drive market growth and our market share disproportionately as part of that, all while increasing margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Hey guys, good morning. Just a couple of quick ones, I guess first on China, I'm not sure Jon if you gave us a growth number for this quarter. I think last quarter was up eight but that had about two points of pull forward ahead of the Singles' Day? And then secondly in beauty clearly a standout this quarter, how sustainable is the positive mix benefit you're seeing in the beauty segment? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So China up, you rightly pointed out was up eight last quarter, it was up six in the quarter that we just completed and some really strong so well on track for our mid-single-digits estimate for the year. Some really strong progress in parts of the beauty business, some really strong progress in grooming, strong progress in laundry, feminine care was up double-digits, so overall very, very good.","In terms of the positive mix or let me take the question a different way, do we think that SK-II growth is sustainable certainly at attractive levels? Yes. More importantly, the balance of the beauty business continues to be very healthy. I mentioned Olay growth -- or I may not but Olay grew 3% in China for the quarter. Overall global skincare growth was up every part of our beauty business was up versus year ago, hair care was up 3% as an example with all brands up with one exception which was Vidal.","So very broad progress in beauty across geographies. So I think that that is sustainable, the main inflection point going forward is to address a couple of the items that that we've talked about on this call and that you've asked about which are grooming and the big help from an index standpoint there just ahead of us and to address some of the issues in baby care which we're being very proactive about.","Operator","And your final question comes from Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen","Hey good morning. Thank you for the question. I think you indicated earlier that you're building share disproportionately in non-tracked channels and I'm wondering one you said did I interpret that right is that accurate and then if so what have you been able -- how have you been able to kind of accomplish that? I mean, what is it about the way you're positioning your brands, the investments you're making in non-tracked channels or the consumer within those channels that's kind of enabling you to do that and I know there's an online component and there may be some other non-tracked channels that are large that you're having success in. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","First as it relates to ecommerce, we're building share broadly across our large markets in ecommerce and we've built share in 8 out of 10 categories in the last quarter. So that continues to grow disproportionately. I mentioned, I think in the prepared remarks for example Olay growing 80% in ecommerce in China for the quarter.","More broadly as you talk about non-track channels and we've talked about some of this before, If you look at this, let's just take the U.S. as an example what's really happening from a retail standpoint or one could argue is happening from a retail standpoint is that shopping is moving to more limited assortment channels. So the club channels growing very quickly, the discounter channel, small format stores and online which we would argue is a very limited assortment shopping experience, there's obviously a broad array of assortment that's available but the amount of that assortment that's actually access and considered in a typical ecommerce shopping trip is extraordinarily low.","And generally, we do well in low assortment environments, you want to feel, if you're going to carry a low assortment or if your shopper is going to expose themselves to a relatively limited assortment, you want it to be that assortment which drives your business as a retailer and that tends to be leading brands.","So you see in ecommerce, a disproportionate appearance in the first and second page of a search for leading brands in many of our categories. You see in discount channels a willingness to carry branded products in some categories but typically only, only one or two brands or the market leader.","So I would expect and that doesn't mean that we have any inherent right to win in those channels, we need to be very, very competitive and are focused in doing that wherever consumers want to shop. But those dynamics have tended to work in our favor and I would expect would continue going forward.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

Foreign exchange lowered sales growth by 2 points resulting in all-in sales growth of 2%.","P&G global value share was around 20% for the March to May period, roughly in line with the prior year. Market share improved sequentially throughout the quarter. In May, the last period for which we currently have global share data, volume share increased 0.4 points versus prior year with growth in all regions except Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. On a mixed adjusted basis, May global value share was up 0.2 points. In the U.S where we have data through June, mix adjusted value share was up 0.3 points. We held or grew global market share in businesses representing nearly 60% of sales in the March to May period. In the U.S, we held or grew value share in businesses representing over 70% of sales.","Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $0.79, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range due to cost savings and a $0.01 help in tax. Core earnings per share was down 4% versus the prior year as the benefits from top of range organic sales growth and strong cost savings were more than offset by mix, higher marketing spending and a $0.06 per share or roughly 7 percentage points earnings per share growth headwind from foreign exchange rate. All-in earnings per share were $0.64. This includes a $0.02 non-core impact from restructuring costs, a $0.04 non-core impact from legal items in Europe and a $0.10 non-core, non-cash impact of a further impairment of intangible assets related to the Brown business, reflecting the 20% devaluation of the currency in Japan where Brown earns the majority of its profits.","Core operating profit margin declined 130 basis points as core gross margin was down 90 basis points and core SG&A cost increased 40 basis points. Operating margin was about 50 basis points less than we had originally anticipated due largely to foreign exchange. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%, in line with last year. We generated 2.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $1 billion in stock and returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends.","Turning to the fiscal year, we met our commitments on each key measure. Organic sales growth was 3%, in the mid-point of our initial guidance range of 2% to 4%. We grew core earnings per share of 5% above our initial minus 1% to plus 4% guidance range. We absorbed the unexpected impact of the Venezuela Bol\u00edvar devaluation and significant overall dollar strengthening, while increasing marketing investments as the year progressed. We continued to make good progress on our productivity plans. Through June we reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by 7,000 roles. This is 1,300 role reductions ahead of our initial enrollment reduction target for June 30, 2013. We delivered over $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings and approved manufacturing productivity by 7% versus the target of 5%.","Our progress on working capital and capital spending productivity enabled us to deliver 98% adjusted free cash flow productivity, ahead of our 90% target. We returned $12.5 billion to shareholders, 110% of net earnings through a combination of $6.5 billion in dividends and $6 billion in share repurchase. In April we raised the dividend by 7%. We\u2019re beginning to restore growth in the core U.S. Market that represents over a third of P&G sales and an even greater percentage of profit. U.S. Fourth quarter organic sales grew at 7% on a volume growth of 5%.","We maintained good developing market momentum. Organic sales growth in our top 10 developing markets was up 8% in the fiscal year. We grew profit meaningfully ahead of sales in developing market while increasing investments in these markets year-on-year. We stabilized global market share and ended the year with modest market share growth. We are moving in the right direction, but there is more work to do.","To talk us through that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to A.G.","A.G. Lafley","Thanks, Jon. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time doing a deep dive over the past two months, making sure we fully understand our reality, ensuring we see things as they are, not as we want them to be. We\u2019ve gotten grounded in the realities of our consumers and markets. I\u2019ve personally dialoged with customer, partners and suppliers. We've listened to a range of outside advisors, critics, as well as fans. We\u2019ve taken a hard look at business strategies, reviewed budgets and business plans and dug deeply into innovation programs and productivity initiatives. We know we are not winning, like we know we can, and we are committed to make the changes we know we need to make to improve P&G's performance significantly. First, we will establish value creation. First and foremost for consumers, but also importantly for share owners as our clear priority. Operating TSR will be our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level, requiring sales growth, progress on growth and operating margins and strong cash flow productivity.","We focused on business unit value creation because we are determined to have more P&G business units deliver more operating TSR more consistently. We will we guided by disciplined strategies and operating plans. We will focus strategically on core businesses, our leading, most profitable categories in brands and leading most profitable market channels and customers. Delivering consistently strong results in our core business is the largest contributor to shareholder value creation, an important contributor to growth and an important enabler of investments in developing markets and innovation.","Many of our strongest business units and total company positions are in the U.S. we need to ensure P&G's home market stays strong and growing. We will focus developing market investments on the categories and countries with the largest size of the prize and the highest likelihood of winning. Developing markets driven by demographics and household income growth will continue to be a significant growth driver for the company. We will continue to focus the company's portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create disproportionate value and continuing to exit those where we cannot.","Second, we will strengthen and accelerate productivity and cost savings. Productivity and innovation are the primary drivers of growth in value creation. Productivity is particularly important in a slower growth world and in an environment of increased volatility in foreign exchange, commodity and interest rate markets. And the more productivity means more opportunities to invest in core business in developing markets, expansion and in innovation. Here is what we are doing specifically with P&G's productivity initiative. We will deliver the productivity program we promised, on or ahead of schedule. But that is not an end-point for productivity improvement. It's just the next milestone along our productivity journey. We know we can do more.","We are already mobilized to address the next round of productivity initiatives. We are working these significant opportunities in parallel, not sequentially. They cover a full range of cost and cash opportunities. Projects are being led by business unit and function leaders. They are being worked on short cycles. Some are yielding savings as we speak, others will take years to fully implement. We have opportunities to further localize supply chains in developing markets reducing cost and improving customer service.","In developed markets we are taking a blank sheet of paper look at supply chains, designing from the consumer and customer back. We are studying options that would reduce the number of facilities, build scale across categories and reduce cost and inventory, all while improving customer responsiveness and service. This will require investment but will generate very attractive returns. That\u2019s a huge opportunity. We will redesign and strengthen our go-to-market operations in North America and Europe to be more effective and efficient.","In Europe, we will look to scale operations across larger and fewer country clusters. We will evaluate organization design options to improve effectiveness and efficiency in developing markets. We will further reduce the size of support staff and move from fully dedicated functional support organizations to a more productive hybrid of dedicated and (inaudible) work resources and shared services. We will improve marketing ROI, driven by an optimized mix of advertizing media, greater clarity of communication and messaging and greater efficiency in non-advertising marketing spending.","The key point to understand today is that we are committed to making productivity a core strength for P&G, like branding or innovation and with innovation, a second big driver of operating TSR and value creation. It has to for P&G to deliver leading value creation and growth. Productivity will become systemic, not episodic. We will continuously improve our effectiveness and efficiency. We'll measure productivity. We'll recognize it and we'll reward it. Third, we will improve our operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably every day, everywhere to win with consumers and win with customers. Execution is the only strategy they ever see. Winning with consumers and winning with customers day-in and day-out is what it takes to generate leadership returns in our industry and that's what we've committed to do.","Fourth, we will reallocate some of our savings to make strategic investments in a very focused way in innovation and go-to-market capabilities. These are two of the company's core strengths and two important sources of competitive advantage. They are critical to winning the first and second moments of truth with consumers. We will build on the past year, but we will be more focused. We\u2019ll commercialize brand and product innovations with excellence. We\u2019ll prioritize productivity initiatives, significantly simplifying and streamlining how we work together and we will bring a sense of urgency to realizing hard savings. We'll focus on best in class execution and we'll continue to invest selectively where needed to win.","I\u2019m confident that P&G has what it takes to win with consumers, with customers and for all of our shareholders. We have a strong brand portfolio with 25 category leading billion dollar brands and 15 more between $0.5 billion and $1 billion in annual sales. We have leading brand equities in most of our categories. We have consumer preferred products in a majority of our brand product lines. We have a well-balanced geographic portfolio. We have the leading CPG business from the U.S, the largest and fastest growing developed market and we have the leading household and personal care business in developing market. Both are significant sources of value creation opportunities. We have an innovation portfolio and pipeline that will only get stronger. We have an exciting portfolio of productivity initiatives we're working hard.","We have outstanding people. The productivity and organization design changes we are making are freeing up P&G-ers to fully leverage their creativity and initiative, their skills and capabilities. They are passionate about the consumers they serve and about their businesses. They are committed to win. They are our most important asset, a critical source of strength and ultimately competitive advantage for this company. We've taken a hard look at what we need to do, how we need to change to perform better. More business units have to deliver more consistently. We're committed to do what it takes to get P&G back to balance, consistency, reliability and sustainability in the creation of value for consumers and customers and value for shareholders and employees. It takes time to work out of a tough patch. We take encouragement from the progress we've made in the year just closed, but we are focused on the future and we are determined to deliver industry leading value creation.","Jon Moeller","Thanks A.G. As we said we would at the Deutsche Bank conference in June A.G, Terry, John and I have spent some time reviewing our guidance framework. We've talked to shareholders and analysts as we've done this work and we\u2019ve looked at a number of benchmarking studies. The preponderance of feedbacks we've received supports the decision we\u2019ve made to focus our guidance on the fiscal year, which we\u2019ll update quarterly. This approach is the norm in our industry. We believe it provides a better match between our guidance timeframe, the long-term view we take while managing the business and the investment time horizon of many of our shareholders.","We've also reviewed long-term guidance targets. We continue to believe that the right organic sales growth target is one that is modestly above the rate of market growth. At current market growth rates we see high single digit bottom-line growth as a right objective. We believe these targets will allow the company to strike the right balance between long-term investments in growth, flexibility to respond to macro and competitive challenges, and delivery of consistent, dependable results in our value creation goals. With that let me move to guidance for the fiscal year.","Fiscal 2014 presents several challenges and opportunities, headwinds include weaker underlying market growth, a much stronger dollar, higher commodity costs and a highly competitive operating environment. Opportunities include positive market share momentum, a number of promising innovations and savings from productivity improvements. We're currently forecasting organic sales growth of 3% to 4% which is better than last year at 3% and compares to expected market growth rates of about 3% to 4%. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of about 2 points which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for fiscal 2014.","Moving to the bottom line, our current forecast is for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. Equal to prior year growth at the low-end of the range and within our long-term annual growth target range at the high-end. This core earnings per share guidance includes a 6 point impact from foreign exchange. We expect the effective tax rate on core earnings to be in line with prior year levels. Our plans include another year of strong productivity improvement. We have line of sight to $1.4 billion in cost of goods sold savings in fiscal 2014, including manufacturing and productivity improvements of around 6%. As I said earlier, we exceeded our overhead enrollment reduction targets by 1,300 roles as of the end of June, giving us a nice head start on the 2% to 4% reduction we were planning for fiscal 2014. We will deliver this and accelerate fiscal '15 reductions in to fiscal '14.","We expect marketing spending to increase in absolute dollars but decrease modestly as a percentage of sales as we continue to drive higher ROI. On an all-in GAAP adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to grow approximately 7% to 9%. This range reflects somewhat lower non-core restructuring cost in fiscal year 2014 versus the prior year. We continue to operate in a volatile environment with uncertainty in the foreign exchange and commodity markets, decelerated market growth rates and a rapidly developing policy environment. Our guidance is based on mid-July foreign exchange spot rates, further strengthening of the dollar or significant devaluations, for example in Venezuela, are not built into our forecast.","As we described last quarter, one particular risk not included in our all-in earnings guidance is the potential impact from the revaluation of Venezuelan bolivars, earmarked for foreign currency transactions through the new (inaudible) auction rate market. At this time there is no official information available on details or plan frequency of the new auction process or the underlying rates. So far we've measured all our Venezuela exposures at the official exchange rates of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. If it becomes clear as the auction rate market forms, that it will operate in a liquid and transparent matter at a different rate, we may need to adjust our balance sheet which will result in additional non-core impact on earnings. We'll keep you updated on this as we learn more.","Major changes in market growth rates or significantly adverse policy changes are also not assumed within our guidance range. Absent these or other unanticipated events, we believe our core earnings per share guidance range is realistic and balanced. It reflects the headwinds we're facing, the investments we'll be making, and the strong cost savings progress we are committed to deliver. If you think about earnings progress throughout the year, there are several headwinds that will impact first half earnings growth that will dissipate or disappear in the second half. For example, foreign exchange will be a significant headwind in the first half but should moderate in the second half.","We'll continue to have relatively high spending and manufacturing startup costs, but this will largely annualize in the second half of fiscal 2014. We will annualize the operating impacts of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation in the second half. Stepped up marketing support levels will also annualize and productivity savings will build throughout the year. Last, the first half comparison includes the onetime gain from the Western European bleach business in the base period. With all of these factors considered, core earnings per share growth will likely be down modestly in Q1 with slight improvement in Q2. Second half earnings will be much stronger. We expect to deliver another year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sale and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, continuing to deliver on our commitment of cash return to shareholders.","In closing, our primary objective for fiscal 2014 is to continue to build on the momentum we\u2019ve created, making this year another stepping stone back to our long-term growth objectives. Our plans are even more focused and even more balanced. We will make choiceful investments in our core business, most promising developing markets and biggest innovation opportunities and we will aggressively drive productivity and cost savings. Above all we'll remain focused on value creation for consumers, for customers and for our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. As a remainder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available on slides which will be posted on our website www.pg.com following the call. A.G, Terry and I would now be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of with John Faucher JP Morgan. Please proceed","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan","A quick question for you. Historically you guys have talked about revenue growth 100 basis points I think ahead of the market. So if we look at your organic sales growth guidance this year, it's more of an in line number. Then when you factor in, you're dropping a decent amount of the productivity to the bottom-line. Can you talk about maybe why you're not spending more to maybe get a little bit more market share given the growth of the category? So what's driving the decision in terms of dropping more to the bottom-line versus potentially spending it back? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","John, we'll continue as we have good opportunities to drive return and create value to invest behind innovation, as A.G. mentioned behind go-to-market capability and advertising where we can generate a return. And as I\u2019ve said many times before, cost savings is not the objective. Value creation is the objective and we will not follow cost savings out of the window at the expense of capability and opportunity of which we have many.","A.G. Lafley","Jon, two quick points. The past five years, two, three, three, three, three. Most recent quarter, four. So if you\u2019re going to see things as they are, we\u2019ve got to demonstrate we can grow faster, point number one. We\u2019re prepared to invest to grow faster. And with clearer strategies, we\u2019ll make investments where the size of the price is attractive and where we think we have the plan to win. Second point, this is our external commitment. We have internal goals.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","Hey, you talked about the deep dive that you did. Can you just talk about what you think that P&G was doing wrong during the period? And then maybe what you're going to stop doing? and then maybe empirically, like how you're going to define success going forward mid 30% numbers around it?","A.G. Lafley","I'd like to take a couple minutes here to step back because this is an opportunity to talk about strategy I think at the company level and at the business unit level. The quick answer to your second question or second part of your question, Bill, is it is value creation. And the first place we've got to create value is for more consumers, more consistently with our brands and product offerings. And then the second place we have to do it is for the company for shareholders. And that's a balanced mix of net sales growth, gross and operating margin growth and cash productivity. If I may on the strategy, at the business unit level, we want to be more choiceful, clearer. We want to be more focused and we want to be really clear about our priorities, and we want to be very specific about what is winning for the business unit with consumers to create value. We want to be very specific and prioritize where we're going to play. We're going to be much more specific about our business model, how we're going to win. And we're going to get really clear in our core strength not just how we leverage the core strength that the company has, or what very specific and particular core strengths we need to win in that industry with that market. So that's really the focus at business unit level. Get more focused, get clear, set our priorities and then operate with discipline and execute with excellence.","At the company level, the keyword is balance. And you've followed this company, many of you followed this company and this industry for a long time, and when we have a pretty good decade, three things happen. We grow the value of our core businesses, whatever our core is at that time. We find at least one major new business that we can turn into core. Baby diapers in the 60s, tissue (inaudible), family care in the 70s, care in the 80s, hair care in 90s. Arguably we got home and oral care, and family care back into the core fold, the team did over the last decade. And we made some progress creating cores in skin and Prestige beauty and we bought a shaving business which is core.","So that's the second leg of the stool. The first leg of the stool is you grow the value of your existing core. The second leg of the stool is you find some new core, and the third leg of the stool has been moving into new space. Generally, we talk about geography but it's also included channels, okay. And if you really look at the history of the company, we've found new geography and we've also found new channels, okay. But we need to do all three. We need to grow from the core. We need to accelerate growth into faster growing, higher margin, more structurally attractive. That means less capital intensive, less competitively concentrated industries, and we need to extend into emerging markets.","And we are just trying to get that balance back. And as I said in my prepared remarks, generally winning in the core drives a surprising -- the existing core drives a surprising amount of the value creation and actually a surprising amount of the growth each decade, and here is the key. It's what enables ,okay. It brings us the capabilities, it brings us the cash, it brings us the human resources to extend into new industries and categories that can be core, and to extend in the new geographies and channels. So we're just working hard to get the balance right. And when you've got an $80 billion plus company that's in 15 to 20 different businesses depending on how you count them, and the 100 plus geographies, balance is really important.","The other thing we're doing is, we're taking a hard look at our core strengths. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we've got to turn productivity into just as strong of strength as innovation because those are the two biggest drivers of value creation in the P&G business model. We've got to turn operating with discipline and executing with excellence into a core strength just as we turn choice full, sharpened strategies into a core strength. We still have to have deep understanding of consumers, we still have to be able to create brands and build them forever, if we can. We still have to be the innovation leader in the industries and categories we choose to compete in, and we still have to have our go to market capabilities and grow them and we try to create as we go along, some scale.","So that's really where we focused. We focused on balancing, getting crystal clear about what is winning. Balancing with where to play and taking a hard look at the core strength. So, again, we have a balanced set of core strengths to go forward. We are locked on it. I think at the company level all that\u2019s left to do is, get the expression in the fewest possible words, which is a burden that Jon and I will predominantly carry in the next couple of days. And at the business unit level, as you might imagine, we\u2019re just grinding our way through one business at a time.","We\u2019ve been through them all once. We\u2019ve been through their operating plans and budgets for the next year, which is another shot at them. And now we\u2019re doubling down and working real hard where we think we have the most opportunity, either the most upside opportunity or the most production opportunity. So I hope that helps, because I think it\u2019s really important to understand. Balance at the company level, three legs on the stool, core totally new businesses where we can play to our strengths and hopefully create new core and new space. And right now the biggest opportunity in new space happens to be developing markets, which are demographically and economically advantaged. But it's also e-commerce. So like I said I hope that's helpful. That's what we\u2019re trying to do and now of course we\u2019ve got to execute.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays","So I guess what I'm really curious about is thinking over the last year review of where things stand and looking over the past few years. The message on productivity couldn't be more clear and is obviously very important to the go-forward capability to operate in a tougher world. But if you look at the last call it two years or so, investment in the business hasn't really been the challenge. There has been money to spend and even when there hasn't been a lot of money to spend, there has been money spent to try to drive topline, yet something\u2019s still been missing. And I feel like over the last couple of years, we've seen P&G have more disappointments on what was expected to be a good innovation pipeline, new ideas, things that would change the trajectory of -- and this is the broad statement because it applies across the business unit. So in this deep dive, A.G, what have you seen that says to you maybe we\u2019re not as good as we used to be or why are we not as good as we used to be understanding what the consumer wants, what the competitive landscape is, because there has been a lot of shortfalls that aren't about spending. It's about what the company has been spending on. Thanks.","A.G. Lafley","Maybe a bad baseball analogy, but we've got to get our batting average and our OPS up. And as we go through this industry-by-industry, business-by-business, where the strategies are clearer and more choiceful, where we know who the consumers are that matter most, where the brand promise is crystal clear and we execute it in the communication and where our products are preferred by consumers, we get it done. And in any mix of businesses we, in just the past few years and I\u2019ll miss a few, we have the family cares and we have the prestige beauties and we have the oral cares. And I don\u2019t want to leave out home cares and others that have been consistently performing. But I think if you do your analysis or we do our analysis, it comes back to real clarity around who the consumer is and delivering for that consumer. Ultimately it's a better consumer value equation and a better experience.","Real strategic clarity, a proven business model and by the way it isn't a proven business model that lasts forever. You're continually adjusting your business model. But a business model that\u2019s agile and still actionable and still works and frankly the ability to operate with discipline and execute with excellence. This is an industry where execution really, really matters. And like I said, of the handful of businesses that have done it really well, we now have 15 to 20 businesses that are focused like a laser and doing it really well starting July the 1st, 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan Stanley","A.G, I was hoping for more perspective, specifically on beauty and what strategy tweaks you\u2019re making behind that business to improve market share trends. And as you look back over the last few years, what are some of the learnings as you look at the performance there. And then also from a portfolio standpoint, are you comfortable with the current portfolio you have in beauty or there are gaps you would like to fill in overtime?","A.G. Lafley","Okay. On the second one. We are continuing -- we are always reviewing the portfolios at the company level, at the business unit level. And again as I said in my prepared remarks, if they are a strategic fit and they are performing, delivering value, they are in. If they are not, we'll deal with it. On the first one, it's not really different conceptually, okay. It's not really different in getting the consumer focused, right. Getting the brand and the product innovation program right and having the clarity and sharpness and the strategy that translates to operating discipline and executional excellence. That's all we're saying.","I think, again, if you really look at the beauty business, we took a business, we put together this collection of businesses. Mark and I and others know it was a collection in 2000 of businesses that we called beauty. And in six or seven years we tripled that business. We took it to $21 billion. The problem is we are still looking at it, we actually took it to 22 plus. We are still looking at $20 billion business. Now, I view that as opportunity, okay, in seven years, right. Shiseido has been in beauty for 150 years, L'Oreal since 1900, so over a 100 years. Estee Lauder since World War II, so over 60 years. We have been really at it for over 15 years. Fortunately we picked up a couple of decent assets back in 2000. But it's a learning curve and we clearly stalled in a couple of places. But again Prestige Beauty is in very good shape. We went from nothing in arguably one of the toughest segments, two a $3 billion plus business.","We have a very fine, fine fragrance business that makes -- and that's grown at a very consistent rate. From the time we bought the two little pieces back in the yearly 90s, we've grown at a compound annual growth rate on the top line of 11%. It's been volatile through the recession, it's been a pretty consistent value creator. And, hey, let's face it, we're up against some of the best in the world in (inaudible) skin care and fine fragrance, and we've done quite well. And the reason we've done quite well is our strategy is sharp and we know we need a certain sort of core strengths to play in Prestige beauty and we leveraged some of the P&G core strengths to be a little bit different.","We've stayed very steady on some of our hair care brands. We have an issue on Pantene, we're working it. It's primarily but not exclusively, a U.S. and North America issue. We've ground through those plans a few times, we picked the boards room. I have been here like six days, okay. We went through an innovation review, we have been through the strategy. We know what the program should look like over the next six months, to the next 12 months, to the next 18 and 24 months. Hey, businesses stall, but it stalled at $3 billion, okay. I would rather -- one of the things I learned in private equity the last four years, I had rather work -- spend as much time and energy on $1 billion business as you do on $200 million business. And believe me you get better value creation for it if you can get it going.","On the skincare side it's pretty much the same story. We went from, frankly, playing but not winning for the first 15 years after we bought Olay from RBI. To, all of a sudden, we took a business that was several $100 million and we turned it into a $2 billion plus business. It stalled, and again bored through it, been through the strategy, been through the product program. We know what we are going to do over the next 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. But these are assets. They have little connections with consumers. If we get the consumer connections back, if we get the brand promises and architecture collections, whatever you want to call it, right, and if we execute like we think we can with our marketing and product program, there is plenty of room to grow.","And I guess a last point I will make, because I know I am going on a little long here. Remember why we choose to get beauty and personal care in the first place. They are large. They are demographically driven. They grow a little faster. They\u2019re big in the U.S and the developed markets. They\u2019re big in developing markets and only getting bigger. They\u2019re structurally attractive, low capital, high gross margin and they are fragmented. It's not like anybody is dominating these spaces. There is room for a lot of players who can get it done to do well. So long winded way of saying hey we stalled a lot of it with choices we made and maybe things we struggled at, but we know what to do and we\u2019re on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citi","First thing, I know you had a target of delivering a 50% improvement in your local currency EBIT margins if you will and (inaudible) profits in emerging markets. Can you tell us where you came out for the full year on that? And related to that, I\u2019m having a hard time reconciling the concept of balance and striving for balance when you\u2019re talking about EBIT growth 3 or 4 or 5 times your topline growth. And I\u2019m just wondering how that sets you up. I think A.G your historical strategy was to deliver consistent results. And I have a hard time seeing how that strong double digit EPS growth is going to be sustainable and why you wouldn't, in your first year here coming back to the company, find a bucket to put some pennies to save them for a rainy day because it seems like it's an awfully aggressive goal at this juncture. Thanks","Jon Moeller","So let me provide a little bit of perspective on both of those questions, Wendy. We did grow profit in developing markets meaningful ahead of sales. So we did build margin. I\u2019m not go into the actual number. As you can imagine with all of the currency movements, a number compared today to what we were talking about three or even six months ago is not that relevant. What's relevant is that we continue to grow profit meaningfully ahead of sales. And I can commit that we have done and we'll continue to do that in developing markets. While by the way somewhat an answer to your second question, increasing investments. So this isn't about building profitability by pulling back. It's about increasing profitability through productivity, through localization of supply chain, through increasing scale and through the right choices.","On the second piece, if we grow our topline, let\u2019s just be optimistic for a second at the high end of our guidance range at 4%, that translates absent volume leverage to 4% on the bottom-line. And the productivity program, which is about $2 billion of savings per year on its face, is worth another 11 points. So that brings you to 15. We get benefit from share repurchase of 1 to 2 points. So you\u2019re at 16 to 17. And we've talked about a non FX impacted number of something like 11 to 13. So there is a significant amount of investment back within that number. And as I said earlier, we're not going to be guided by specific metrics. We're going to be guided, except one which is value creation. And when there is an opportunity to create value through additional investments we will not hesitate.","A.G. Lafley","If I just might add maybe two or three points, Wendy quickly. We have a stronger product and brand innovation pipeline this year going in, but it's not huge yet. So a lot of the pipeline is still in development qualification or early stages of commercialization. So you can't invest in it, in development. Second point is we said we are investing back in core strengths. Without going into the specific number, we have invested back the biggest amount of money in this next year. You have to go back to the middle of the last decade to get that investment. And as we went through the strategies and product programs, it was very clear to me and to others that we needed to make that investment back. And I guess the third thing I would say is we are trying to thread a needle here. And we're trying to look at what we can really do and what we really need to get ready to do. And I think it's going to take a couple of years before we have got everything in place so that we are hitting on enough cylinders to perform to our full potential. So we view this as a transition year, last year was a stepping stone year, and we'll see how it goes. Absolute last point. Jon and I, and the team are totally together. If we are on something that's taking off, we are going to invest in it. And hopefully we've given ourselves enough flexibility and in the end we're going to do what's right for the business over the mid and long-term and we're going to create value as we do it.","Jon Moeller","Just one more point, sorry. I spend a fair amount of time, maybe too much time in our prepared remarks talking about things that weren't in the forecast, in terms of further FX weakening and those type of things. And I've told you before that we're not going to follow FX or commodities out of the window just to deliver a number. We are going to execute the strategy. I would just repeat that in terms of our commitment to do what it takes to get the business growing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","A.G., welcome back. I wasn\u2019t covering you when you were here before, so I look forward to meeting you. I have reviewed the history and some of the initiatives you spearheaded and how you're operating. In your time apart, kind of reflecting back in, we have private equity experience and we work in academia. I guess my question is, how does it change your perspective and as you come back into the organization, how do you see yourself either managing or operating this business differently?","A.G. Lafley","Well, I think there are probably three things. The first one is the importance ultimately, overriding importance ultimately of value creation in a B2B business for your customers and your shareholders, in a B2C business like ours, for your consumers and your shareholders. If we get just those two pieces right, a lot of this other stuff is going to fall into place. Second thing is sense of urgency. Private equity world you don't have -- you have a certain amount of time to generate the value, and I think bringing a sense of urgency is helpful. Thirdly, you have to be very choice full and you have to be very focused, and you have to be very prioritized with your strategy choices because they drive the operating budget and plan and they drive the execution.","So I think we are tightening them down. And I guess the last one is sort of our culture. We had a great conversation about this as a leadership team and we're going to build on the strengths. But we have just got to, we have got to a much more agile, a much faster, a much more decisive culture. And we've talked a lot about agreeing, disagreeing, committing and going. And we are just trying to -- we are making decisions quickly. We are delegating the the decisions where they should be made. I need to make a few, but most of these decisions are made by the business unit leaders or they are made in the markets where we are closest to the customers and the consumer. So getting clear about who makes the decisions, getting clear about making the decisions, getting on with it and then executing.","And I guess the last thing is, you get on very short learning cycles. And my point is, you learn as much as you can from the past. You learn from your successes and you learn for your missteps and then you get on with it. You get focused in the future and you get out there and you try it the next time. So those are probably some of the things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Just a quick clarification on 2014 and a real question. Maybe Jon this is for you, want to get a better sense of you're saying that Procter will be accelerated, but you're also saying that the restructuring charges will be lower in 2014. And also, just want to get a sense of how should we think about capital allocation assumptions from buybacks, et cetera that are embedded in your numbers. But the bigger question maybe A.G. For you is the story you paint out is very exciting in terms of fixing some things that were wrong. But I really want to get little more specifics if you can at this stage. So it\u2019s like get that the consumer wasn't read right, but how are you going to fix that as a company? I get that execution wasn't right, but what's going to change on that? I get that choiceful decisions weren't necessarily made perfectly. Why was that case? How you are going to fix that? And I ask on the context of as you look at the company today, you\u2019ve done your deep dive the past two months. What are the big capability gaps that you think exist? And particularly relative to your competitive set that has clearly been progressing during not just the past four, five years, but the past decade on getting some of these core things that a CPG company does right better.","A.G. Lafley","Ali, I feel like I\u2019m repeating myself. So I'll try to get this clearer. In the external world that we've been in, choicefulness and clarity are even more important. And it's not just me. It's as I said the business leaders, market leaders, channel leaders, customer leaders, country leaders. Point number two, I\u2019m not going to -- we have the methodologies. We have the tools and techniques to understand who our best consumer is business-by-business, brand-by-brand and to act on it, but you\u2019ve got to use it and you\u2019ve got to act on it. So we've rededicated ourselves to really understanding the consumer, really winning with the consumer. Everything begins and ends with the consumer. We win a consumer, we get a higher -- our business model is very simple. If we can get a higher trial and purchase rate and we can get better usage and more loyalty, that drives the value creation. But we need to be incredibly disciplined to stay on that business model.","The third thing is operating discipline. The strategic discussion of the business unit level is about discipline, the discipline of choice, the discipline focus, the discipline of prioritization. We need to be more disciplined in our operating plans. We need to be more disciplined in our financial forecast. We just need to be more disciplined. And then the last one is -- and again it's not that we don't know how to do it because we are doing it. We just need to do it more consistently and we need to do it more broadly. We need to be disciplined in our execution. This is a highly executional industry and we have to win one shopper at a time, one consumer at a time, one retail location, whether it's a store or an open market or e-commerce at a time. And we just need to be very executionally focused. And I think those are the key things.","Jon Moeller","And the answer to the first part of your question, Ali, on the relationship between the acceleration of productivity savings and the appearance of lower restructuring next year and all those things reconcile, I\u2019ll just make three points there. First, not every savings opportunity requires a restructuring investment. So for example, improving our marketing ROI does not cost anything in terms of restructuring and that scenario that we\u2019re going to get better at next year than we have been historically. Not all cost of goods sold savings require restructuring investment. And to the extent that we can deliver savings that are at or ahead of plan with even less restructuring investment, that's a good thing.","Second, we\u2019ve talked about over the period of time enrollment reduction of 16% to 22%. The 7,000 roles we\u2019ve reduced represents about 13%. So we're going to keep going and it doesn't stop at the end of the five year period. But a big chunk of the role reductions which drive disproportionately restructuring spending, have occurred. So that's kind of how that's happening. As with the prior commentary, we're not fixated on a restructuring budget. If there are good opportunities to drive savings sooner and more, we will fund those. And we'll be sure to update you on that as we progress.","Last, real quick on capital allocation. We will continue to prioritize the dividend. This year was the 57th consecutive year we've increased the dividend, as I said before without the 58th, you will probably be talking to somebody else. And we'll continue to repurchase shares with the balance of cash that's available. Our philosophy on this is very simple. Cash that we have is not ours, that yours. It's our job to deploy it to earn decent returns and then what's left we will distribute. So really, no significant change in capital allocation philosophy going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Just two quick, sort of high level questions. I guess first A.G. You have talked about looking at today's reality and seeing things as they are and not how you want them to be. So I just want to clarify what you're speaking to there, not necessarily P&G's capabilities and opportunities versus where they were three, four, five years ago, but more or so what you are seeing in the marketplace and specifically market growth which has obviously slowed in the last two, three, four years. And then sort of related to that, you talk a lot about creating value both for consumers as well for shareholders, and I think part of the consumer value equation clearly is price. And so could you comment on how you see your price levels right now, generally speaking? Are you comfortable with the price levers or does there need to be some strategic change in parts of your business? Thanks.","A.G. Lafley","Okay. Let me talk about market, maybe some first impressions of consumer changes and then talk about value, and I'll let John talk about the pricing situation. First market. I mean obviously developing markets are slowing but they are still projected to grow at 6%. And as I said earlier, all you have to look at are demographics and economics. And I think that's a pretty long arc of growth for our industry and still a pretty big opportunity for this company. We've actually grown since the Berlin Wall came down and Guangzhou City markets opened in 88, 89. We've grown 9% a year compounded annual growth in developing markets. We have grown 14% compounded in the last 10 years. As Jon said in his comments, we've grown 10% in the BRIC markets this last year. And that growth is there for a lot of players in this industry. Because a lot of it is still tailwind, right. It's babies being born, households forming, incomes rising and you just get market growth.","Second point is, how have consumers changed. You don't go through the second biggest financial crisis in recent history and a prolonged global recession without changing some of your habits, practices, attitudes and beliefs. And we of course have been digging into that. I think you could make an argument, I'll use -- you can make an argument that there may three critical moments of truth right now. The consumers, I call it zero, other people call it something else but there is clearly a period driven by the desire to get the best value they can. Not only the best price but the best value. And driven by technology, mobile technology, computer technology, the internet etcetera. And there is this period of information gathering, education, brand and product comparison and that includes price comparison.","So a lot of shoppers are coming to the purchase decision with having done a lot more preparation. Still what matters is, the first one that really matters is the purchase. We've got to win the preliminary. We've got to get into the consideration set. We've really got to win the purchase so we don't have the chance of winning the usage. So I think that's one thing that\u2019s changed.","I think the second thing that\u2019s changed and you see it in a number of our businesses is, we really have to build a strong vertical and horizontal brand and product line portfolio. And it's not just about developed market and developing markets. It's about giving more consumers more opportunities to try their way in, make that first purchase into your brand and product line. And they\u2019re going to make the choice about where based on what they need and want and based on what their value equation is. So if you look at shave care or you look at hair care or you look at fabric and home care, you\u2019re looking family care, we\u2019ve tried to build much more robust vertical offerings. And we\u2019re continuing to work hard on that. So the consumer can come in at different points. So think about it as we need to trade them in first and then we can work on trading them up. And I guess the -- so that's the market. That's the consumer. And hey, there\u2019s a third thing. No matter -- I didn't want to get into the details here and I\u2019m not going to, but every business that's really delivering and we have at least a handful or more, they really know who their consumers are. They have a very clear consumer segmentation model and we need that. That's the math that we start with.","So here is the key. Regardless of what segment you\u2019re in, value is a factor. So if you\u2019re buying SK-II at 145 bucks for the opening price point on Essence, billion dollar plus brand and Prestige, Ultra Prestige Skincare, there is still a value equation. And we have to understand what it is for that one (inaudible). If you\u2019re buying Charmin Basic at a buck or two a pack, there is a value equation. And we need to understand those value equations. We are never going to compete purely on price. We are a differentiated, branded, innovative product company. But we are going to compete across a broader range of price point and we are going to compete with brand and product line architectures that attract more consumers and give them a chance to try it.","Jon Moeller","And clearly one measure of our success in presenting propositions with appropriate value equations for consumers, is our share of the market. And right now we're modestly building market share growth, which would imply that more times, but not always, but more times than not, we\u2019re getting the value equations right. We'll continue to refine that. This is something that requires daily attention, but generally I think we are across the broad portfolio in the right place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Connie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","In the context of your comments on execution and understanding and creating value, I was hoping to get your perspective on what's been going on Tide PODS. Is this a product that is actually creating value? What went wrong with the execution? We're looking at monthly sales that have been flat since the start of the year or the end of last year, even as the capacity issues were supposedly resolved. So your perspective on that might help give a little bit of context to the things you see as you come back. Thanks so much.","A.G. Lafley","Sure. Connie, I think -- first of all we are committed to Tide PODS. It\u2019s a $0.5 billion business with a lot of upside growth. And it clearly -- it's a good value for consumers who want -- don't want to think about the dosage amount and who want the convenience in performance that is delivered in that brand\u2019s performance offering and product form. Second thing is -- yeah, we've been struggling to keep up with demand. I don't think we were merchandised until last month. Do I have that right, Jon? I mean the first month we were merchandised, ever merchandised so far, in a U.S. customer was last month. So I would argue we have been out there with one hand behind our back because we can't display it and we can't support it. I think as we've reported, we are moving into Europe. It's a different source of supply. It's not going to impact what we're trying to do here in the U.S. and North America. But I guess the last thing I would say is, hey, in four decades you work on a lot of disruptive new products and product forms, start- ups aren\u2019t easy. We don't always get it right the first time. We did an (inaudible) liquid back in the mid 80s, we did untie with bleach, we have it on some others.","But this one is so unique, it's so discontinuous, and for a group of segment of consumers at least so far, early returns, they seem to like it if they try it. And they seem to come back and buy it again. It's clearly creating value for the industry. And this is a category or industry that's hard to create value in, left with own devices. Some would commoditize it. And it's in our interest to keep it differentiated, branded and innovative. So we are taking a mid to long-term point of view on Tide PODS and we are going to stay at it, and we are going to see what it's ultimate potential is with the consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed ","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning everyone and welcome back A.G. I wonder whether you could, in the context of breaking out fourth quarter organic sales growth between the U.S., Europe and developing and emerging markets, not just BRIC. How this execution that you want to improve, is going to helped by the changes in the go-to-market capabilities? Because one of the things that actually surprised us in the last couple of years is is that the bulk of the weakness of your business was the U.S., was in the backyard. So the inability of the company to adopt to the volatility of the consumer environment was surprising to us. So to what extent does decision making process needs to be reviewed beyond making the go to market capability more efficient in terms of savings? Thank you.","A.G. Lafley","Okay. Two points, that I think are relevant and important to your question. We need to grow in the U.S., even at 2% to 3% estimates for the future, 3% GDP growth, market growth. You know you pick a number but it's still growing and it's definitely growing faster than Europe or Japan. And given our position, we need to grow in the U.S. and we need to get stronger in the U.S. Point number one. I think you see, hopefully you can see, that we reinvested in the U.S. We started to get it going again in the U.S. in this last year and it definitely showed up in the fourth quarter. But as far as I am concerned that's only the beginning, okay. Point number one.","Point number two is, we need to do a better job in all the important channels where consumers shop. I won't go into the details but we're clearly strong in some channels. We play in others, we need to get stronger in those channels and we're even testing coverage in channels that we haven't served in the U.S. and Canada. So I do think there is a distribution opportunity and I have a very simple principle. If a meaningful number of consumers shop in this channel, whether it's ecommerce, whether it's a small urban store or whether it's a drug chain, a club store, whatever, we have got to be there. We have got to be available. We have got to be in distribution and we have to have the right mix of brands and products to meet her or his needs.","So I am totally with you. I think there is an opportunity in the U.S. By the way we also have opportunities in Western Europe along the same lines and that's a huge business for us too. So even though it's not growing, we\u2019ve got to get our share. Developing markets is still a huge opportunity for the company and part of the opportunity is distribution related. Again I won't go back into the detail, but we've gone back into some big strategically core developing markets and we've taken a hard look at our distribution and coverage position. And we're concluding that we have big opportunities there. So you will see us work hard on making sure we have availability, making sure we\u2019re in distribution and make sure we have the right brand and product presence where we need to, which is where consumers shop.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please proceed. Analyst","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Welcome back A.G. Wanted to talk a little bit about the commitment to investment spend. You\u2019ve talked a lot about it on a high level. Can you talk about what marketing spend you expect going forward? And then obviously the U.S. growth was very solid. Can you provide some colors on the sustainability of that and then the growth drivers behind that? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","So first in terms of advertising spend, we will again increase advertising spending pretty significantly year-on-year, but we'll do it probably 20 basis points lower than the rate of sales growth. That does not mean less advertising. It does not mean less reach, less frequency. it means more effective advertising, the right mix of media and importantly reducing non-advertising costs that the consumers never see. So we feel good about our ability to continue to support growth in the business with a more efficient model. A.G, do you want talk to about the U.S?","A.G. Lafley","Yeah. One more, one very quick comment on the point Jon just made. We're interested in effectiveness. We know brand by brand in the U.S and in a lot of other markets the range of effectiveness we can deliver and it\u2019s wide. And so we are holding all of the businesses to a minimum ROI. We're pounding away on communication effectiveness. We\u2019re pounding away on best media. Our digital I think is now up to 35% in the U.S. roughly. It goes up and down, 25% to 35%. We have some businesses and brands where digital is incredibly effective, and we\u2019re doing more. We have other brands that are on the learning curve. They\u2019ve got to get up the learning curve faster.","But it\u2019s a brand by brand, category by category, consumer segment by consumer segment set of decisions. And basically what we are going to do -- our problem is not the total amount we are spending. Our problem is the mix, our opportunity is the mix and we are going to get the mix better and better and better and there is a lot of opportunity there. On the second question which is the U.S, yeah, we think it's sustainable. We definitely think it's sustainable because if you crawl inside the fourth quarter results, we\u2019re doing much better overall but we\u2019re still being carried by fewer businesses than we would like to be. And there\u2019s an opportunity for all of our businesses to do better in the U.S. and North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.

Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. As this was another relatively straightforward quarter, and as David Taylor will be with us to provide additional depth at CAGNY in just a few weeks. I'm going to keep prepared remarks this morning brief, turning fairly quickly to your questions.","This was another very solid quarter, top line, bottom line and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization strategies. Organic sales up 5%, three points of volume growth, two points of price mix.","Two-year stack average growth of 4.5%, fiscal year-to-date organic sales growth of 6%, calendar year 2019 organic growth of 6%. This growth continues to be broad based. Nine of 10 global categories grew organic sales, Skin and Personal Care up double digits, Personal Health Care and Home Care grew high singles, Fabric Care, Feminine Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Grooming grew mid-single digits. Family Care grew low singles. Focus markets and enterprise markets each grew mid singles.","We continue to perform very well in our two largest markets, the US up 4% and China up 13% for the quarter, aggregate market share continuing to grow. These results required us to overcome several challenges. While we're seeing real signs of progress with Grooming organic sales up 4% this quarter, we're still working to sustainably improve results in this business and in Baby Care.","Sales results in Japan, our third largest market, created nearly a half point drag on total company organic sales growth due to the timing of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1. The timing as we highlighted last quarter, led to higher shipments last quarter and lower shipments in the quarter we just completed.","We faced market level challenges in an increasing number of markets, India, the UK, Australia, Turkey, Iraq, Nigeria, Kenya, Lebanon, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and the Hong Kong market. Through all of this, we grew organic sales 5% on the quarter and 6% over the first half.","Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were up 14% versus the prior year. Foreign Exchange was a one point earnings growth headwind, so on a constant currency basis core earnings per share increased 15%. Fiscal year-to-date core earnings per share are up 18%, up 19% on a constant currency basis.","Gross margin up 200 basis points in the second quarter, core operating margin up 190 basis points, continued strong cash generation, with operating cash flow of $4.4 billion and free cash flow productivity of 100%. $1.9 billion of dividends paid, $3.5 billion of P&G stock repurchased, $5.4 billion of cash returned to shareholders.","We'd another strong quarter, solid volume sales and market share trends across both categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareholders. We continue to face the challenges of a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and of competitive response to our growth. But all in we're continuing to make progress behind a set of integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies.","The strategic choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. We establish and extend the superiority of our brands. To make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain and to improve organization focus, agility and accountability, reinforce and build on each other.","They position as well within our industry to deal with near term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid and long term.","Moving to guidance, we're again increasing our fiscal year outlook for organic sales growth, for core earnings per share growth and for free cash flow productivity, as well as cash return. We started the year with organic sales growth guidance of 3% to 4%. We increased the range to 3% to 5% last quarter and are now increasing the range to 4% to 5%. This 4% to 5% range compares with underlying market growth of 3% to 4%, implying continued market share growth.","On the bottom line our core earnings per share growth guidance started the year at a range of 4% to 9%. We raised the range to 5% to 10% last quarter and we're now increasing the range again to 8% to 11% for the year. We're increasing our outlook for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% going into the year to 95% last quarter and now to 100%.","We'll extend our long track record of significant cash generation and cash returned expecting to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and now increasing our outlook for share repurchase from a range of $6 billion to $8 billion to a range of $7 billion to $8 billion in fiscal 2020. While we've delivered strong first half results, please keep in mind that comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both top line and bottom line. Pricing annualizes as we move through the back half of the year affecting both top and bottom line trends.","We'll comp the earnings gains from the Boston landfill and Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors are responding to our outperformance, which will require continued innovation and equity building investments on our part. And the market level challenges I mentioned earlier will be top and bottom line headwinds for the balance of the year.","Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not included within the new and improved guidance ranges.","We look forward to seeing many of you at the CAGNY conference in just a few weeks. As I mentioned, David Taylor will join us and we'll provide further perspective on forward looking strategies and plans. We look forward to engaging with you into benefiting from your thoughts and reactions.","With that I'm happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey Jon, I want to just focus on organic sales growth obviously the 5% results still very healthy this quarter, but it is below 7% in each of the prior two quarters. It sounds like some of that's Japan timing based on the prepared remarks. I'm assuming perhaps the US inventory reductions as the retailer's approach fiscal year end. So just want to get your read on an underlying basis looking at retail sales growth and shipment timing ex inventory changes, has anything changed in terms of the underlying momentum as you look at the fiscal Q2 results versus the last couple of quarters. And then within that answer, perhaps you can just touch briefly on the competitive environment. Have you seen incremental promotion with the recent commodity pullback, and also give us an update on China performance in the quarter and any impact so far from the virus that we're seeing over there? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","I could complete the whole call there. On the first part of your question, we're very pleased with the top line growth in the quarter that we just completed. As you all know, we delivered 7% as you mentioned in the prior quarter, our guidance was three to five for the full fiscal year, implying something below that beyond the first quarter, and we delivered at the high end of that range. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth was broad based both across categories and regions. And we built market share. From an underlying consumption standpoint, you've seen the uptick numbers, at least through December, which continue to be very strong. And we really haven't seen anything that would cause us to change that outlook kind of first part of the current quarter. So all the fundamentals are there, our superiority levels continue to increase, we're investing behind that while building margins. We're building market share and increasingly the growth is broader as you look at both categories and geographies.","We did have some headwinds in the quarter from two items. You mentioned probably three. You mentioned one which is Japan and that had a half point impact which benefited the prior quarter. The other dynamic has been a series and I mentioned this also in my prepared remarks of geopolitical, economic, societal and other impacts in individual markets. I mean, think about what's happened in the last \u2013 well, since we last gathered even. The situation in the Hong Kong market has continued to be difficult, which had a real impact on the quarter and had an impact on the travel retail business. Some of the market level events in South America whether that's Argentina or Chile, where stores were burnt and are not yet back in place. Some of the events that you're very familiar with in our headline items in the Middle East impacted our business as well. And those items will impact us going forward for the balance of the year. I'm very \u2013 we're very pleased that we were able to overcome all of that, and still deliver very strong numbers that built share and build household penetration and allow us to deliver significant bottom line benefits.","From a competitive environment standpoint which was the second part of your question. Promotion levels \u2013 percentage of sales in our category sold and promotion are actually down. The index at 98 for the last quarter, that's all I have visibility to. I don't have visibility to the future. And where individual competitors are up versus year ago, they're up typically a point. So very simply and we can get into this later with others if you want more detail. We're not seeing competitive activity that's indicative of downward price spirals by any means. That can change tomorrow, but what we have in front of us today continues to look very healthy.","China, we are very optimistic about our prospects in China. It's a difficult market. It moves at a very fast pace both of our consumer and trade channel standpoint. But we continue to increase the rate of growth in that market. You'll recall four years ago, we were at minus one. The following year, we were at plus seven, fusing plus \u2013 minus five, plus one, plus seven, last year plus 10 and fiscal year-to-date of plus 13. So that continues to be a very attractive market within that some really strong growth rates in some categories. I'm talking the high 20% in categories like Skin Care, Feminine Care over 20%, Fabric Care double digits, so generally a very strong market. I have no idea what the developments are going to be relative to the new virus. We're obviously monitoring that closely as it relates both to the health of our employees and broader communities. And we'll have to see what impact that has, if any, on whether this was going forward. But it's one of those things that I do think it's important to mention because it can have broad impacts well beyond China. It can also affect consumer confidence in large parts of the market. It can affect travel, which does affect our business. And so it's one of the many pieces of volatility that's just important we keep front of us as we think about the prospects for the future which I view is generally extremely positive, but not without risking without challenge.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning. So Jon, I'll stick to one topic here. And just to clarify one of your responses. The slowdown you're seeing in travel retail is that specific to Hong Kong or is it a little bit broader based in China. That would be a quick clarification. And the broader question would be can you talk to just what we're seeing across the global beauty spectrum in the portfolio right now, how is China performing with SK-II versus Olay and then what is the opportunity to extend SK-II to broader markets looking forward? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Another three parter, I'll try to get to each of the pieces efficiently. Travel retail concentrated in Hong Kong. Beauty broadly continues to do extremely well. This is our 17th consecutive quarter of growth with Q2 up 8%. That growth is broad based. Healthcare grew 6% of the quarter. Our Skin and Personal business grew to 10%. It was actually a relatively slow quarter for SK-II given both the VAT dynamic in Japan where SK-II has a big business and the Hong Kong dynamics. Skin Care broadly in China, as I mentioned, is doing extraordinarily well. Olay was up strong, strong double digits. And \u2013 but the balance of the business as well. Our Safeguard business, which is part of our beauty, grew double digits, again strong double digits over 20%. So the growth in beauty both on a global basis and within the China market is broad based.","I think you asked another question, but I'd don't \u2013 SK-II expansion. Yeah. There are \u2013 so first of all, there are significant opportunities in the markets that we're in as evidenced by the current growth rates. There are also the right time and in the right way, expansion opportunities available. Are there other questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you. I just want to double click on what you just said on the China \u2013 from the China, how it evolved for the quarter and if you're baking any more level of conservatism into the backend of the year given what happened recently. So I think what you also discuss is Hair Care coming back, so you've got a gating effect from what could be expected in a continuation and all the deceleration for SK-II. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Let me first talk about Hair Care and I'm assuming the questions is in the China context. We grew Hair Care in the mid to high single digits in China, which is the fastest growth rate in a period of time. And so yes, that can offer some offsets if you will to other businesses that may soften to competitive activity or other things. On the other hand, the Hair Care business is a highly, highly competitive business as are many other categories. So the dynamics can change there quite rapidly. Our job is to continue to steadily increase our margin of superiority. And if we do that, over time, if not quarter-to-quarter, we'll continue to have a strong business.","In terms of the conservatism in the back half of the year, I'll answer this question both relative to China which obviously we don't provide specific guidance for and the balance of the company. One thing to keep in mind with China is the timing of Chinese New Year, which is, you know, from all the press on China recently is happening beginning as we speak. And that is earlier in the calendar year than it typically occurs. And so it's likely there was some sell in the OMD period that wouldn't have been there and the prior period. But on a global P&G basis that doesn't move the needle significantly, but something just to be aware of as relates to the China specific situation.","I talked in my prepared remarks about some of the headwinds that exist that increase there in the quarter and will impact us in the back half of the year or could impact us in the back half of the year. We talked about the market level dynamics. So if you take a market that may not be that large, but take a market like Chile. That impact happened at the very end of the quarter, and will exist through the balance of the year. The same with, for example, the situation in Lebanon, the same for the situation in Iraq, the Indian market, the growth rates have slowed, still growing and we're doing very well and building chair. But the challenges there have increased and will likely remain for the balance of the year. So that's one reason, one thing that needs to be netted against to strong progress that we hope to continue to make.","The other is the annualization of price increases. So for example, in February, we annualize both a Dish Care price increase from year ago and a Family Care price increase from a year ago. And I don't want to talk about how we're going to handle pricing going forward. That's kind of off limits. But regardless though the annualization impacts as well as some of the price increases we've taken for evaluation over the last year will annualize. And third is the competitive environment. And I don't know what that's going to hold. I've described what it's held so far. But most of our calendars \u2013 most of our competitors are calendar year based. They start their new fiscal years as we speak. And many of them have talked, understandably, about increasing investments for growth. That can be a very healthy thing. It can grow categories, we can all benefit from that. But certain implementations of that obviously are less healthy.","Now, against all of that backdrop, we continue to make progress on the things that we control or making very strong progress, our margin of superiority is increasing across the board. It's dynamic, it's not static. So we have moves forward and moves back, but the net move is a forward move. We're in a position because of our productivity programs to invest to support communication of that superiority. And that's really driving some outsized growth in many of our categories. And over time and it will take some time. I expect we'll deliver higher growth rates on businesses like Baby Care. So overall, we're very optimistic about where we stand today and what the future holds, at least in the near term, but it would be irresponsible not to acknowledge the challenges that exist.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great, thanks. Good morning. I'm going to ask one question. And I just wanted to talk a little bit about Grooming and particularly shaving. And you'd mentioned there were still some devaluation driven pricing. And I just was curious if you could talk about performance to the business to specific to developed markets, and how things are trending the impact of Gillette sensitive, you've made some portfolio moves, right. There's been several already been apart, you've just acquired Billie. So you can maybe give us a little bit of lay of the land there how you're chipping away and making progress or not so much in shave care would be great.","Jon Moeller","Thanks Lauren. And within that one question you've managed to ask three which is very well done. Our Grooming business strengthened in the quarter overall, we were up 4% and that's the third consecutive quarter of growth. Importantly, we grew global market share point three points, which is very encouraging. Shaving within that was up versus year ago, not as much as \u2013 I mean not as much as the dry shave business, but the wet shave business did grow. And we've seen pretty strong response to our investments both in products in and communication. Encouragingly, we've added 18 million new users to our brands over the last 12 months. SkinGuard is contributing to category growth; it's doing well and continues to expand. In the US, for example, razor value share on SkinGuard is now 9%, which is a third largest for a P&G sub brand. And we're building unlike most of our competitors our shave business online.","We're pretty excited about the Billie acquisition. That's something that obviously needs to pass regulatory clearance. And we need to remain separate from that business until that happens. But there's a real unique set of skills, experiences and knowledge between Billie and P&G that we think has the potential to create some real magic. Clearly, they've created very effectively a fresh new brand that extends across several categories. And they've done it and we can benefit from their experience on this in a digital fashion with one-to-one mass marketing, which is something we're continuing to increase our focus on and capabilities related to. We have innovation capability across the majority of their categories. We have best in class manufacturing across the majority of their categories. And we have a go-to-market presence, both online and brick-and-mortar, certainly in omni channel that can accelerate the growth in that business. So we're very excited about the potential and are working through the clearance process.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, I think \u2013 I wanted to ask in more detail your view about the future on pricing for kind of the future solidness of some of recent price increases globally given there is starting to be just like Jon competitive murmurs of more investments coming. You know, like most recently Exedy [ph] in Europe, yesterday's really talking about pricing, and commodities clearly continue to fall. Again, you're not seeing anything yet. But within that context, two questions. One is what kind of lead time notice you get in terms of price competition? So can you feel comfortable saying it's all clear for a quarter or it's clear for two quarters, or just like literally this may change tomorrow? And then the second thing is part of our cost of jobs is pattern recognition. And so historically, we have seen that prices, this increased rate's been on everything down in categories, especially maybe in Family, with these types of commodity decline. Do you think this time is different and if so kind of why? So there's a technical question on timing, and there's more of a, how do you see the go for given the patterns we've seen it for. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Ali. Obviously, just related to Exedy first, they're talking about a market that we're not competing in. I know that you know that. That is a very different market. It's much more of a commodity market than our primary market from a talent standpoint, which is what I believe they were talking about, which is North America. In general, we see commodity prices as supportive of the current prices in the market. So while they're down some versus kind of historical levels and where we were before the price increases went into effect, we feel the current prices are justified that does not speak to an indication of future activity, I won't go there. And our outlook for those commodities continues to be relatively flat to slight increases, particularly in the in the pulse space. But I don't see the kind of sea change environment that would necessitate activity.","Having said that each competitor will do what they choose to do and we need to be responsive to that which gets to your second question. And candidly, we do not have advance notice of the implementation of price increases. And so we are \u2013 decreases sorry, either one. And so we react as we see those in the marketplace. And that reaction time, typically is anywhere from a quarter to six months. So if we think along a reasonable period of time. I don't expect this to be a crippling dynamic or anything resembling that going forward and may cause a quarter of two of odd benefit or hurt, but not a big thing to worry about.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Unlike some of your peers who have had less margin expansion and your margin trends have been terrific. And a lot of that seems to been driven by the productivity initiatives. I know you're kind of coming. Are you in your felt for maybe of your five year program? And I'm just wondering, what's your outlook, not for the next quarter, but sort of for the next two to three years? Is there another $10 billion restructuring program coming or how do you keep this productivity benefits accruing when you come into the end of the program. Thanks","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Wendy. I mentioned as one of our strategic choices, the desire to make productivity as integral to our nature, as innovation, and be leaders in productivity just as we are in innovation. And I think we've made a lot of progress on that journey, as you rightly point out, which is reflected in our margins certainly this quarter. My hope is that as we move forward, this is simply an integral part of our operating strategy. And it needs to be because we will need to continue to invest in \u2013 of holding advancing our margin of superiority. Some of the continuous disruption we're talking about will also require some investment that's in human resources, capital, et cetera. And I feel very good about each of the business units understanding and commitment to continue delivering productivity.","So that brings us to another part of the question which is, are there degrees of freedom that enable that to occur? Will is one thing, delivery is another. And I don't think we've ever been in a place where there are more degrees of freedom or more opportunities to improve productivity, the tools that we have available to us now across the digital spectrum and that's everywhere from marketing to the manufacturing floor to the office environment, had never offered more opportunity than they do today. And we have significant opportunities still in terms of how we think about our new organization structure and other opportunities within that as we learn more about it to become even more efficient and effective and I certainly believe they are \u2013 there are.","I just attended along with David, a review of our product supply innovation program last week, and there are big opportunities relative to robotics, relative to a tighter sequencing of the entire supply chain from order signal all the way back to delivery where the middle of a sustainable product supply transformation across markets and geographies. So I continue to believe that productivity will be an inherent part of our operating strategy and we have the tools and opportunities to continue to deliver that.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great, thanks, good morning. I want to talk a little bit about advertising because that continues to move up 150 basis points this quarter. And at this point, I think there's a fair bit of investment already in the base. So was that always applying to continue to increase? Or is this more optimistic than you expected? Was it \u2013 is there anything that you need to defend? Because obviously, you said that we haven't seen that much of a change in percent of sales goals on promos. So just wondering where that advertising dollar is going towards? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","A couple of things there Olivia, we've been very clear. I think that while we need to be competitive in the trade spending standpoint and need to offer attractive margins to our retail partners, where we have a degree of flexibility, we would prefer to spend that incremental dollar on advertising or innovation every day of the week. The reason is very simple. There's nothing proprietary and pricing, we can build proprietary advantage with both advertising and innovation. So again, on the margin, where we have the opportunity to make those shifts, we're doing it. And we're doing it in a way that is attractive to our retail partners as well because it drives business and grows categories. The second piece we've talked a lot about, and Marc Pritchard, our Chief Marketing Officer has talked a lot about externally is the opportunity to move what were historically a significant amount of non-working dollars into working and advertising. And that's been about a billion dollar shift and it continues.","And the third piece of this is when you have innovation that's noticeably superior. You need to want to ensure would be communicating that superiority and those performance benefits and the value that comes with them to consumers. And the good news is we have a lot of very strong innovation in the marketplace that has a lot of legs left in terms of either just launched or something like paws or beads which have been on the market for a number of years that have significant household penetration opportunities and our pure delighters from a consumption standpoint. We want to be supporting those. I mentioned both as relates to competitive activity, but also in general that we will continue to invest in both equity and innovation as we move forward.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Good morning Jon. Congratulations on another strong quarter. Can we come back to China which was particularly strong in the quarter against a notably difficult comparison? Can you delineate a bit the company's progress in that market between category strength and superior Proctor market share performance and maybe how that's changed? You talk about Skin Care, obviously very strong up 20%. Fem Care, I think was up double digits. Maybe just talk a little bit about how much of this is category versus strategic execution by Proctor in certain categories and then your expectations here for the balance of the year? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks Kevin. It's honestly hard to separate those because if we do our job right from an execution standpoint and an innovation standpoint of a growth, we grow markets, so we don't view market growth as something that is separate from our efforts. It's in many cases, obviously not 100%. But it's caused by our efforts. I realized that's not that helpful to you, but it's an important point. As we back up from that and I look at category growth in China, it continues to be strong in our categories. The one area that's under a little bit of pressure from a category growth stand point is Baby Care and that relates to the birth rates, which have gone from about 15 million babies a year down to 10, which is significant impact. On the other hand, within that category, there are significant premiumization opportunities and the premium part of our business is growing 20% or 30%, depending on whether that's premium tape diapers or pants style diapers, but in general and China the answer on category growth is remains very strong.","The answer on if you will P&Gs specific efforts if you pretend for a second that they're not impacting category growth that also is abundant and real. I mean, we've gone \u2013 it's not that the inflection in category growth rate that has changed the results on Skin Care, it's our share of progress within the category, albeit in a very growth full category. So we've gone from declines, perennial declines on that business to perennial gains and strong double digit gains. The improvement in our Hair Care top line is still not what we'd like it to be but definitely improved from where we've been. Is a result of much stronger branding and innovation efforts as well as go-to-market strengthening, so it's hard for me to fuse those apart? The simple answer is it's both and that's a good thing.","Operator","Your next question will come from the mind of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks and Happy New Year. Two questions for me. First on US growth, you mentioned 4%. Obviously, solid in context of the US, but it is a decel from last quarter and it comes despite an easier comp. Is there anything worth calling out any nuance to take note of there on that growth? And then secondly, on the Baby, Fem and Family Care segment, growth was a little weaker than we expected this quarter. It's kind of bleak as we've seen in a while. I know this has been one business, it's been a little harder for you to kind of get going like everything else. Can you walk us through what the game plan is and what our expectations should be for that business as we think about the next 12 months? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","I'll start where you started. US growth of 4% is indeed very strong and it's building market share. We built market share in the US over the past three, six and 12 months periods. Nine of our 10 categories grew in the US in the last quarter. The one that didn't was either at a 98.5 or 99.5 index. The difference between the quarters reflects a number of things. Part of it is trade inventory, which was reduced as we went through the second quarter. There's initiative timing that impacts this pretty significantly as well. I would expect going forward we're going to continue to see some chop, if we look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. But across a slightly longer period of time, we remain very, very happy with the way the business is progressing. And if we look at underlying consumption going back to a discussion earlier in this call that continues to be as you've seen, at least the scanner data, very, very strong.","From a Baby Care standpoint, if you look at the first half of the year, Baby Care was flat to up slightly which is a better position we've been in. And it ranges from \u2013 if we look at our two largest markets, China and the US, those are relatively \u2013 again on a relative basis healthy. China in the first half, we grew at 5%. That's the fastest growth where we've had from \u2013 on a semester basis in about six years. We regain market share leadership about two years ago and have continued to hold that. As I mentioned, in the last answer, we're growing our premium business our pants business, very, very strongly. The US we're about flat versus year ago, which again, is an improvement on a relative basis. And what should take both of those businesses as well as the broader Baby Care business to a stronger position is innovation which builds superiority. We have across parts of the portfolio, not been offering a superior product. It's larger than some of those cases of parody product. We have strong innovation plans in place not only in terms of eco mentality, but we really increase the pace of innovation and the amount that's coming to market, a lot of which has driven the China results that I talked about. But innovation, whether it's a Baby Care or Beauty Care, it's not an overnight endeavor and we'll continue to hopefully, improve sequentially as we go forward.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good morning, everybody. I guess maybe just a quick question for you, Jon. The enterprise versus rest of business seems to slow down a little bit. You guys don't really talk about EM versus DM kind of anymore, but maybe talk a bit about what has driven the slowdown you touched on Chile, Hong Kong, et cetera. How much is that in terms of country specific issues versus laughing the pricing and kind of happy to be thinking about that dynamic on a go forward basis?","Jon Moeller","We're pretty pleased with the growth rates in the enterprise markets currently. We mentioned mid-single digits. It's really at the border of mid-single digits and high single digits. I'll leave you with that. And that's despite these pretty significant impacts. If you think about two of the largest markets in the enterprise environment are India and Mexico, and I talked about the slowing growth rates in India, largely as a result of some of the monetary policies, which has created a bit of a liquidity squeeze, which is drying up inventory through the system. But we continue to grow well in India and are building share. Mexico's technically, from an economic growth standpoint, in a recession. We continue to grow reasonably well there. We have been single digits and are growing share there as well. So broadly, we continue to be pretty pleased with our progress. And just briefly, even though it wasn't part of your question on the bottom line, we're creating more value in these markets currently then we ever have. So our bottom line progress was strong double digits, well ahead of the company average. We need to be focused on value creation in these markets that includes growth where we can generate a meaningful return and that's what we're focused on doing and there's tons of opportunity.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you, Jon. I'd like to kind of focus on ecommerce. I think in the past, you've said that it's about 8% of sales is that moved up maybe closer to 10? And globally, how fast is it growing on a global basis, then specifically how fast in China, how fast in the US and are you gaining share in ecommerce in China and the US? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","It continues to be a significant opportunity for growth. It's currently growing at about 30%.","And in the big ecommerce markets, well, that growth differs across categories. It's pretty much at that level across markets. It is now about 10% of our total business. And what I \u2013 just for clarity when I mention ecommerce, I'm talking obviously the totality of ecommerce which includes omni channel. And our market share in general has been increasing. Of course, there's some volatility to that, but particularly in a china context and again it differs by category. We've been making significant progress in that space, so I see us as very well positioned to succeed in that space, though that's something that requires eternal efforts, flexibility and the constructive disruption of ourselves which we're committed to, to ensure that we offer a competitive and relevant offering, wherever consumers want to shop, whether that's ecommerce, whether that's large format or that's small format. And generally, we're progressing well in each of those.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","Yes. Good morning. Thanks, everyone. Jon, maybe you can talk a little bit about the Merck OTT business. I mean, health care of was a pretty nice contributor to the top line. So just wanted to understand what's driving that business, kind of what's the strategy there? Any context would be helpful. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","As you probably recall, Merck offers a very complimentary portfolio to our legacy Personal Healthcare P&G business. Has a strong presence in the developing world, complimentary categories across geographies and there were significant we felt cost synergies in addition to revenue synergies by bringing the best of both companies together and driving growth. It's early days, we're still in the middle of integrating we just closed 18 months ago, but we're very pleased with the results so far. This is the first quarter in which Merck has recorded as part of our organic sales growth rates. It contributed positively to that. It's a real asset to our overall Personal Healthcare business and it's playing out that way. The revenue synergies are on track, the cost synergies are on track with some real exciting examples of the possibility of driving both of those ahead of what our initial plans had that. The organization is a strong organization and they're doing a great job, so, so far really, really good.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Bill Chappell","Thanks, good morning. Jon, just circling back to the Billie acquisition, just a little surprised that I guess P&G thinks that that can pass with the FTC and just with your market share and also with kind of FTC cracking down on it a lot of even recent small acquisitions historically. So kind of any thoughts there on why you're moving forward with that and especially on the US positioning. And then if that's part of a plan, and do you think you got more opportunities to do tuck-ins to where you have 40-50 share of a market?","Jon Moeller","In general, just starting from the strategic level, we want to ensure that we are serving consumers in all relevant segments of the categories that we've chosen to plan. Sometimes, that's easier and more straightforward from an organic standpoint, so if you think about the natural segment, for example, something like Pampers Pure, on the other hand, getting a quick presence in some of these high growth segments or with different groups of consumers, it's sometimes easier to do the acquisition. So if I just \u2013 a good example of this is L on Feminine Care, which is now the number one natural product from a market share standpoint, obviously, very early, but so far has proven to be very strong idea to expand in a very relevant consumer segment very quickly. That's the motivation here. I'm obviously not going to speak to regulatory dynamics or anything related to that. But we're excited about this and we're hopeful we have the opportunity to really work to grow this combined set of categories grow the market and create value.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse.","Kaumil Gajrawala","Hi, good morning. Jon, can you talk a little bit about how you and the board think about valuation in the context of share buybacks. Your results are obviously the best that they've been probably in a decade, but so is the -- appropriately so as the value of your shares. So can you just talk a little bit about valuation in buy back context?","Jon Moeller","Sure, obviously, over the last decade, buybacks have created extraordinary value. But that's been on the back, which is implicit in your question on overtime a significant increase in the stock price. If I look at it today, first of all we don't try to forecast where the market's going to go. We don't pretend that we know that. And so, in general, we feel very strongly about our prospects as a company. There's no reason at present not to feel reasonably good about the market itself and so we're kind of, if you will, dollar cost averaging over time. The other thing that's important, though, is to think about the context of our dividend yield relative to financing rates that are available. Because at some level what you're dealing with is, can I retire a dividend rate with an incremental financing cost that's lower than that rate? And with negative interest rates in many parts of the world, this is a very attractive time to be, if you will, financing share repurchase, we're going to stay within our credit limits as we do that. That's another constraint, if you will, or another rail and we'll continually look at this. Obviously, capital allocation is a broad topic inclusive of every purchase is something that is reviewed regularly with the board and we value their input to that, but the current plan obviously reflects that as we sit here today, I don't have a reason to suggest a change in that plan.","Operator","And your final question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Hey, Jon, thank you. Are you concerned at all that your business has become more macro sensitive in the past five to 10 years, in some segments of outsized growth would seem to indicate that, but any historical context or consumer data you have that a farmer to spell that I'd appreciate?","Jon Moeller","I think Jon we're actually less sensitive into the macro environment. And that's been a very deliberate choice we've made. Let me explain that. We were in as we went into the last recession as an example, a lot of \u2013 for a number of relatively to highly discretionary product categories. Things like salon hair color, high end premium fragrance, just two examples. And our intentional and strategic part of our portfolio focus was to be instead in daily use categories that are used in good times and bad times because they're just important to get through the day, sometimes multiple use is important to get through the day. So if you look at the total portfolio through that lens, we're more macro resilient, I would argue today than we were some years ago.","The second reason I say that is the efforts that we've made and will continue to make and the investment we've put behind it on product superiority, product package, the whole set of drivers that inherently increases consumer value. So the value of each purchase is higher than it would have been even inclusive of small price increases. And that too puts us in a better position relative to things like trade down that can happen as a result of macro dynamics and more difficult economic times. Not immune, but in a better position today.","The third thing I would argue is to the extent that we've been successful, and creating a culture where productivity is as integral to our being as innovation. We have more financial flexibility and therefore more degrees of freedom. For how we manage the difficulties that the macro economic situation can present. So for those three reasons Jon I think we're going to \u2013 a much better place today. We will be impacted if there are negative developments in any part of the world. It does create challenge. It's the right question to continue to ask. And I'm not talking in absolutes, but on a relative basis, we're much more macro resilient than I think we were historically.","Great, well, thanks everybody again, just a quick summary. We really view this quarter as another step in our journey forward. Strong top line progress, building market share, strong operating earnings growth, building margins, strong core earnings per share, generating cash, returning back cash to shareholders all behind an integrated strategy that's working and we will continue to execute. We look forward to seeing many of you, as I said earlier at CAGNY and I look forward to our conversations. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17479":["Procter & Gamble Co.

Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.","Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and objected for after tax impact of major divestitures. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings, excluding divestiture gains. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I am here this morning with Bob McDonald and Teri List-Stoll. Our third quarter results were on track with our plan on the top line, market share showed broad based improvement and strengthened as the quarter progressed. And we\u2019re ahead of plan on operating profit, earnings per share, and cash flow. We announced an increase in our dividend and we\u2019re increasing our share repurchase projection on this call to the top end of our target range.","In the March quarter organic sales grew 3%. Sales came in at the lower end of the guidance range due in part to lower market growth. Underlying global market growth was choppy month-to-month and was down about half a point in the March quarter versus the December quarter. Organic volume grew 2% and pricing added one point to organic sales growth. Product and geographic mix was neutral to sales growth.","Foreign exchange impacts lowered sales growth by one point resulting in all-in sales growth of 2%. Global market share trends have continued to improve. We held or grew market share in businesses representing over 50% of sales in the March quarter, with third consecutive quarter-to-quarter improvement from 30% in the June quarter, to 45% in the September quarter to just below 50% in the December quarter and now over 50%. Within the quarter we saw a sequential market share strength ending the period with a strong month in March.","In the U.S. we held or grew value share in businesses representing two-thirds of sales in the March quarter. This is up from 15% in the June quarter of last fiscal year and about 55% in the first half of this fiscal. As with the rest of the Company results strengthened as the quarter progressed with businesses representing over 70% of sales holding or growing share in the month of March. We have more work to do, but trends are continuing to improve.","Moving to the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $0.88. All-in earnings per share include an $0.08 non-core impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bol\u00edvar and $0.03 of non-core restructuring investments to drive productivity improvement. Core earnings per share were $0.99, up 5% versus the prior year and $0.03 above the high end of our guidance range.","Better than expected earnings were driven by strong cost savings and productivity progress, particularly in SG&A where we are exceeding enrollment reduction targets. One of the objectives of our productivity and cost savings plan was to create financial flexibility to maintain strong investment levels and long-term growth while delivering on our bottom line commitments even when we face a weaker microenvironment or other challenges. This quarter was a good example. We over delivered our [go-in and] [ph] guidance despite slower market growth.","Core operating profit margin grew 10 basis points including 260 basis points of productivity improvements and cost savings. Core gross margin improved 20 basis points. Cost savings and productivity helped gross margin by 170 basis points. Pricing and volume leverage improved gross margin by roughly 80 basis points. These benefits were partially offset by 120 basis point negative impact from a combination of product and geographic mix. Innovation and new production capacity startup costs, lowered gross margin by about 70 basis points and commodity costs and foreign exchange were a combined negative impact of approximately 40 basis points.","Core SG&A costs increased 10 basis points. Overhead cost savings of approximately 90 basis points and top line leverage were offset by higher marketing spending, increased plans and benefits costs and foreign exchange impacts. On an all-in basis, including restructuring costs and non-core impacts from Venezuela, gross margin improved 50 basis points and SG&A costs increased 40 basis points. All-in, operating profit margin improved 20 points.","As we highlighted on our last earnings call, the March quarter tax rate was reduced by the true-up needed to reflect the extension of U.S. corporate tax law benefits by Congress in early January. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%, about a point below the prior year level and consistent with guidance. We generated $3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter which is also ahead of our initial forecast. We delivered adjusted free cash flow productivity of 114% for the quarter, which brings fiscal year-to-date adjusted free cash flow productivity to over 90%. This compares to a year ago, year-to-date cash flow productivity figure of 76%.","During the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion in stock. This brings fiscal year-to-date repurchases to 5 billion compared to our estimate of 5 billion to 6 billion for the full fiscal year. We returned $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends. Earlier this month, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7%. This marks the 123rd consecutive year in which we paid a dividend and the 57th consecutive year in which the dividend has increased. At the new annualized dividend of $2.41 per share, our current dividend yield is about 3%.","We remain committed to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Fiscal year-to-date, we've returned 9.8 billion to shareholders; 4.8 billion in dividends and 5 billion in share repurchase. Over the past 10 years, we've returned nearly $98 billion of cash to shareholders, over 90% of net earnings. Stepping back, we're continuing to make good steady progress in our plans, we're on track on the top line despite choppy market conditions with improving market share driven by innovation. Productivity savings are strong enabling us to beat our bottom line commitments while maintaining strong investment levels for long-term growth. We're generating solid cash flow and aggressively returning cash to shareholders.","As we complete fiscal 2013 and finalize our plans for fiscal 2014, our priorities remain unchanged; maintaining strong developing market momentum, strengthening our core developed market business, building and leveraging the strong innovation pipeline and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvements to fuel growth. I'll briefly step through the progress on each of these four priorities. First, maintaining strong developing market momentum; organic sales in developing markets grew 7% in the March quarter, consistent with the growth rate in the first half of the fiscal year despite a modest deceleration in market growth particularly in Brazil and China.","Our business in India grew organic sales more than 20%, the 43rd consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth. Organic sales in Brazil were up 8% as we grew market share for the 36th consecutive month. China organic sales growth improved versus first half growth rates with businesses representing roughly 75% of sales sequentially improving market share. We\u2019re growing beyond the BRIC markets. In Argentina and Venezuela local currency sales were up about 20% in the March quarter, and West Africa sales were up in the high teens.","Portfolio expansion continues to be an important component of our developing market plans. This fiscal year we\u2019ll expand our portfolio to over 30 new category country combinations. Portfolio expansion is enabling us to build scale and improve profitability in these markets. We\u2019re localizing production which lower supply chain costs and improves customer service. And we\u2019re improving the productivity of our SG&A spending as these businesses grow. These are two important drivers of significant profit improvement we expect to deliver in our Top 10 developing markets this year.","We\u2019re improving profits while increasing marketing spending and accelerating the pace of innovation. While we\u2019re being prudent with the pace of our expansions, we are in no way pulling back. By the end of this fiscal year developing markets will represent nearly 40% of annual sales in over 45% of shipments. Sales and after tax profit in developing markets have both increased four fold over the last 10 years. We remain committed to strong profitable growth in developing markets. At the same time we\u2019re working to strengthen our core developed market business with a focus on the 40 largest category country combinations. Most of these businesses are in developed markets and account for about 50% of company sales and 70% of operating profit.","In the U.S. we held or grew value share in businesses representing two thirds of sales in the March quarter with over 70% of sales in the month of March. This is up from 15% in the June quarter of last fiscal year and about 55% in the first half of this fiscal. We\u2019re now growing share in Laundry, Diapers, Family Care, Dish Care, Oral Care, Blades & Razors, Hair Care, Feminine Care, in Antiperspirants and Deodorants. While shares are below year ago in Skin Care and Cosmetics, recent innovations have helped drive sequential period to period share trend improvement. We have strong innovation plans coming soon on Pet Care and Personal Cleansing that should help us return these businesses to share growth.","In Western Europe the percentage of businesses holding or growing share is up to 40% from lows of around 25% earlier this fiscal year. And constant dollar share is improving sequentially on a past 12 to six to three month basis. Japan results have also improved steadily over the past few quarters returning to share growth during the March quarter. Improving developed market trends are being driven by stronger innovation, vertical portfolio expansion and more effective marketing, including strong performance and value claims as well as targeted consumer value corrections. Innovation underpins all of our growth efforts, as is our work to drive greater productivity in everything we do.","It would take a long time to go through each of the innovations we\u2019re leveraging, expanding or introducing, so I thought I\u2019d focus on just five today. First, Tide PODS. Tide PODS now hold the 6.5% value share of the U.S. detergents market and over 75% share of unit dose form. We expect PODS will generate about $500 million of sales this fiscal year in one brand and one region. With additional supply now online, we\u2019ll soon to be able to increase our levels of advertising and in-store display to drive more consumer trial. There\u2019s been a lot written and said about the impact of PODS on the U.S. detergent category. There are several base period impacts that are often conveniently or inconveniently being ignored in these comparisons. These include our 15% price correction on powder detergents. The impact of increasing high-efficiency washing machine penetration and unusually high market growth leading up to the PODS launch due to competitive pantry-loading.","By the end of the summer most of these impacts will be fully into or out of the base period and category growth rate should be more stable. Tide PODS are great for consumers. It provide consumers with a super concentrated exceptionally performing detergent, brightener and stain remover at just the right dosing level, all in one convenient package and product from a brand they trust. Tide PODS deliver as much cleaning power as the 6th next leading competitive unit those products combined. Tide PODS are great for our retail customers. They offer customers a super premium innovation on one of the strongest brands in the world that sells for roughly double the category average price per load in a shelf space return friendly compact form. Tide PODS are great for the environment. They\u2019re the most concentrated detergent available in the market significantly reducing packaging materials and energy usage making each load a more sustainable one.","And finally Tide PODS are great for P&G shareholders. P&G PODS are a consumer preferred product delivered through a proprietary formula, made on proprietary equipment using a proprietary manufacturing process. It's a disruptive innovation that creates a significant competitive advantage for our brands. Ariel 3-in-1 PODS started shipping in Western Europe earlier this month, in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Next month, we'll begin installing PODS in Poland and the Baltic countries.","Distribution results are excellent and week one market shares are outstanding already over a three-share in France and at a two-share in Belgium. We began the launch of Ariel PODS in Latin America with initial shipments starting in Mexico in the March quarter and we'll start shipping in Brazil in a few weeks. We're just entering the laundry category in South Africa with shipments to customers beginning in just a few weeks. Offerings will include a full range of detergent forms including Ariel 3-in-1 PODS.","Next, innovation in our shave care business. Gillette's sensitive skin innovations across Fusion and MACH3 blades and razors and shave preps are beginning to improve share results. 70% of men believe they have sensitive skin and these innovations leverage the fact that our ProGlide products have been recommended by dermatologists in the U.S. as the best shave percent of the skin. In the March quarter, we held our grew value share in the U.S. in all three major elements of male blades and razors; Fusion, MACH3 and disposables. And we're also growing share on Venus blades and razors.","In the dry shaving category, we're in the midst of the global expansion of Braun CoolTec. CoolTec is the world's first dry shaver with integrated active cooling technology, which is clinically proven to show a noticeable reduction in skin irritation. Consumer response to Braun CoolTech has been outstanding in our testing and early in market experience.","Next, we have a strong innovation bundle on pet care. In the March quarter, Iams launched a restage of its ProActive Health premium dry dog and cat food lines. The restage includes new package sizing to indicate consumer preferred price points and new marketing messages that remind pet owners that they're dogs and cats are not vegetarians. Some pet foods add plant proteins like gluten. Iams have 50% more animal protein than competitive products and includes no added gluten.","Over the next two months, Iams is launching several very exciting new product lines. IAMS SO GOOD will be the brand's first entry into the mid price tier of dry dog food. Unlike other leading brands, SO GOOD uses tasty wholesome ingredients like chicken, fruits and vegetables with no dyes, no added sugar and no artificial preservatives. Iams WOOF DELIGHTS are our first significant entry into the wet dog food segment. They use high-quality real meats and fish like turkey, chicken, beef and lamb with no added gluten, no fillers or no artificial flavors. These innovations are healthy alternatives for pets and pet owners and have been extremely well received by our retail customers. IAMS SO GOOD starts shipping next week and WOOF DELIGHTS will start shipping in late May.","We also have a strong program on U.S. hair care that has returned us to share growth with value share up nearly 1 point in March. Our hair care innovation bundle launched in January expands the vertical portfolio. Pantene Expert Collection includes two super premium lines; Age Defy and Advanced plus Keratin Repair. Age Defy leverages a new formula based on our hair biology science yielding hair that acts 10 years younger by thickening hair as 6,500 new strands were added.","Pantene Advanced plus Keratin Repair formula leverages a breakthrough in new conditioner technology to repair two years of hair damage in two minutes. The early results of Expert Collection have been very good, delivering shipments, display and trial results at or above our going-in plans. We've started the expansion of Pantene Expert Collection in Latin America with the launch in Brazil in March.","We've also launched Vidal Sassoon Pro Series in the U.S., a complete hair care line offering shampoo, conditioner, styling and permanent color to give consumers, salon genius brilliantly priced. Vidal Sassoon Pro Series is priced in the salon affordable, value-oriented segment. Vidal shampoo and conditioner are quickly approaching a 2% value share with shipments nearly double our prelaunch estimates.","We're especially pleased with the results of the Pantene and Vidal Sassoon innovations considering the high level of competitive promotional activity during the quarter, which included buy one, get one offers and high-value instant coupons. We've also delivered strong hair results in many developing markets including Wella Pro Series in Brazil and Mexico, Head & Shoulders in Russia and Saudi Arabia, and across Pantene Head & Shoulders and Wella in India.","On the salon professional side of the business, Illumina color from Wella Professional leverages a new patented, micro-light technology and as well as biggest innovation in the last 20 years. With Wella, our consumers experience hair that appears lit from within. Results in Europe and North America have been outstanding delivering sales more than 50% above the internal launch commitments. We just completed the global rollout of the Illumina Color from Wella Professional in the March quarter with expansion in the Latin America and Australia and New Zealand.","Last category and cover today is Oral Care, where innovation is driving strong market share trends in many markets. Toothpaste all outlet value share is up over one point in the U.S., so more than 37%. Behind the continued strength of innovations across the 3D White, Pro-Health and Crest complete lines. 3D White which includes toothpaste, brush, rinse, floss and whitestrips is driving strong share growth in Mexico and the U.K. Mexico reached an all-time high toothpaste value share of nearly 14% for the quarter, up about three points versus prior-year. In the U.K the compilation of 3D White, Oral-B Complete and Oral-B Pro-Expert drove value share to over 10%, up nearly three points versus the prior-year. China market shares are also improving.","We have entered the toothpaste category in more than 40 markets over the past four years, including recent expansions in markets as diverse as France, Australia, Senegal, and Cameron. All of our expansions are delivering results at or above the expected levels. For example in Australia we have reached nearly an 8% value share of toothpaste just one month after launch. In Latin America, Oral Care sales will be up about 50% this fiscal year. We are going through expansion, but are also growing strongly in established markets behind innovation. In Mexico Oral Care sales are projected to be up nearly 40% this fiscal year. In Brazil, a market we entered four years ago, local currency sales are forecasted to grow by more than 60% and shares up by nearly four points.","Now as you know innovation is not just about invention. It\u2019s also about execution. We are delivering improved results across all of our innovations by strengthening our execution with both consumers and retailers. Our communications contain stronger performance and value claims. On air, in digital media, on the package, and at the shelf that demonstrate the superior value our brands provide.","We are improving customer service levels, which along with improved innovation are being recognized by a retail partners and in third-party evaluations. For example, Kantar Retail recently released China PoweRanking named P&G the overall winner by a wider margin than last year. We are increasing distribution in our top of the markets, like China, Brazil, Russia, India and Africa. We are also gaining new distribution with key retailers in developed markets, based on the strength of our leading brands and commitment to lead innovation.","We are a growing share and distribution for example in the Discovery Channel. Ae do sales double-digits in the Channel for the quarter and are increasing distribution with new and existing retail partners. We have also been successful in expanding distribution of Duracell batteries across several important accounts, as we continue to strengthen Duracell results in the coming quarters.","So we have a very strong innovation program that we are working to execute well globally. Like innovation, productivity also underpins all of our developed and developing market efforts, and here too we are making strong progress. The overhead reduction plan we announced last February call for a reduction in non-manufacturing staffing of 10%, or roughly 5,700 roles by the end of this fiscal year, so by June 30th. As of the end of March, we\u2019ve reduced 6,250 roles putting us 550 roles or about 10% above the fiscal year commitment with a full quarter still to go. Exceeding our goals, this year gives us a running start on our announced plans that further reduce non-manufacturing enrollment by an additional 2% to 4% each year over the next three years, bringing the total reduction to between 16% and 22% by the end of fiscal 2016.","We're making good progress on the organization design work being led by Jorge Uribe, Senior Business Leader and we\u2019re feeling confident in our ability to deliver the additional enrollment reduction objectives. We are on track to deliver more than $1.2 billion in savings this fiscal year on cost of goods sold. Our efforts in this area include a targeted 5% net productivity increase across our manufacturing operations, even as we add new manufacturing capacity and enrollments in developing markets. This will allow us to add about 20 new manufacturing operations with no increase in headcount.","So far this year we are tracking well ahead of target at nearly 7% manufacturing productivity improvement. While we are still early in the planning process, we already have line of sight to at least $1.3 billion in additional cost of goods savings for next fiscal year. We're also achieving efficiencies and marketing spending and are reinvesting in these savings to strengthen plans to support our innovations and expansions. We're shifting a greater portion of media spending to digital. This offers a higher return on investment. We're also making good progress on cost savings in non-media marketing spending.","As we embrace our cost savings work, we will continue to keep our eye on the overwriting objective of shareholder value creation, with growth being an important part of this. In our efforts to cut costs, we will not compromise our growth prospects or capabilities. We are building and executing our strategy with the objective of getting this savings and growth balance right.","Now let me turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2013 in the April-June quarter. Starting with the fiscal year, we're holding our organic sales growth guidance range which we improved last quarter at 3% to 4%. Given results in the first three quarters, it's likely we'll be closer to 3% than 4% for the full year.","We expect all-in sales growth in a range of 1% to 2%. This includes the foreign exchange headwind of two points based on year-to-date results and mid-April spot rates for the fourth quarter. We're raising the low-end of our core earnings per share guidance range by $0.02 to $3.96 to $4.04 according to an increase of 3% to 5% compared to prior year core earnings per share of $3.85.","I want to repeat what I've said on several previous occasions relative to guidance. We set a guidance range for a reason. We're committed to deliver a plan that creates long-term value for our shareholders. We will not chase commodities or currency out the window just to deliver a top of range guidance number. We will execute our plan and we'll do it in the most fiscally responsible way we know how.","We believe that our core earnings per share guidance range is realistic not conservative, given several profit headwind we're facing. As I mentioned earlier, market growth rates have weakened dynamics in countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, Egypt, Syria and South Korea continue to be very volatile. Foreign exchange has moved against us in markets such as Japan, Brazil, Argentina and of course Venezuela.","We're incurring preproduction expenses in cost of goods sold as we start up several manufacturing operations simultaneously around the world. And we're investing and marketing to drive our strong innovation pipeline. We're adjusting our all-in earnings per share range to $3.90 to $3.98. This range reflects the improvement in core earnings per share expectations, updated estimates for non-core restructuring costs and the non-core impact of Venezuela currency to valuation.","The all-in earnings outlook now includes approximately $0.19 per share of non-core restructuring investments, an increase of $0.04 since our last estimate due mainly to higher than expected enrollment reductions this fiscal year. One risk not included in our all-in earnings guidance is the potential impact from revaluation of Venezuelan Bolivar's earmarked for foreign currency transactions through the former [Sidney] market.","Venezuela has created a state run [side-cat] auction market to replace [Sidney]. At this time, this is no official information available on the details or planned frequency of the auction process or the underlying rates. So far we've measured all our Venezuela exposures at the official exchange rate of 6.3 Bolivar to the U.S. dollar. If it becomes clear as a [side-cat] market forms that it will operate in a liquid and transparent manner, at a different rate we may need to adjust our balance sheet which will result in additional non-core impact on earnings. We'll keep you updated on this as we learn more.","We continue to expect free cash flow productivity of 90% of net earnings for the year. We increased the dividend by 7% earlier this month and our increasing our share repurchase target to 6 billion which is at the top end of our prior guidance range of 5 billion to 6 billion. For the April and June quarter, we're estimating organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. Foreign exchange is expected to be a two-point headwind to sales growth which leads to all-in sales growth guidance in the range of 1% to 2%.","On the bottom line, we expect June quarter core earnings per share in the range of $0.69 to $0.77. We expect the effective tax rate for the June quarter to be somewhat higher than the previous year's rate. On an all-in basis, we estimate earnings per share in the range of $0.67 to $0.75 including non-core restructuring charges of approximately $0.02 cents share.","In summary, over third quarter results were on track with our plan on the top line, market share showed broad-based improvement, we're ahead of plan on operating profit, earnings per share and cash flow. We've announced an increase in our dividend, our increase in our share repurchase target and have modestly tightened our fiscal year earnings per share guidance range.","Having said this, we still have more work to do. The next piece of this work is planning for 2014 which we\u2019re starting now. We plan to give guidance for 2014 on our next earnings call which is scheduled for Thursday, August 1st. This will give us appropriate time to develop strong plans and more fully assess macro-dynamics like foreign exchange and commodities, market dynamics like Venezuela and Argentina, and internal dynamics such as pension cost, new category expansions and new innovations before providing our outlook.","We remain confident that our focus areas, maintaining momentum in developing markets, strengthening our core developed market business, building and leveraging a strong innovation pipeline and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvement are the right ones and that executing these with excellence should generate over time the kind of earnings progress that will put us among the best industry. This combined with strong cash flow and a track record of capital return to shareholders should enable us to generate superior levels of shareholder return.","That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which will be posted on our website, www.pg.com following the call. While Teri and I, would be happy to take your questions, and the IR team will be available after the call to provide additional perspective.","Question-and-Answer Session","Question","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. You may begin.","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit more about Beauty Care, I mean clearly very good news to hear about how the U.S Hair Care portfolio is performing in the U.S. especially given how competitive it's been, but Beauty Care volume down one, organic sales down one, there\u2019s obviously a lot that you didn\u2019t talk about most notably probably Skin Care and I\u2019m guessing also the overall China business. Thanks.","Bob McDonald","Lauren, I think in Beauty & Grooming we have three key points. Number one is we\u2019ve got a strong portfolio of leading brands. Number two is we\u2019ve got clear plans and sufficient innovation to address these near term opportunities you\u2019re asking about. And number three, there\u2019s a significant opportunity to expand and grow our Beauty & Grooming business beyond where it is today. Let me deal with the clear plans and sufficient innovation piece since I think that\u2019s where your question is coming from. As you suggested in Hair Care we\u2019re expanding the portfolio vertically with innovations like Vidal Sassoon Pro Series in the Salon Affordable Segment and Pantene Expert Series in the Super Premium Segment and this has returned U.S. Hair Care to share growth with value share of one point in March as Jon mentioned. In the U.S. Expert Collection shipments display and trial results are all at or above expectation, and Vidal\u2019s shampoo and conditioners quickly approaching a 2% value share and shipments are nearly double our pre-launch estimates. In Blades and Razors our sensitive skin innovation across Fusion and MACH3 blades and razors and shave preps is leading to improve share results. We\u2019re holding or growing value share in the U.S. on Fusion, MACH3 and Disposables, and we\u2019re also growing share on Venus blades and razors.","In cosmetics share trends have improved sequentially over the past two quarters behind three exciting COVERGIRL innovations. Clump Crusher Mascara by Lashblast, Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Gloss and Stay Fabulous 3-in-1 Foundation. In Salon Professional we returned the growth behind the launch of ILLUMINA Color which is delivering sales more than 50% above going in estimates. Billion Dollar beauty & grooming brands I have talked about the strength to them. And then in Skin Care which was the point you asked about Skin Care in China, we\u2019ve launched several new innovations including upgrades to our existing lines and new innovations would address key segments that we have portfolio gaps. Examples in the United States, new Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, Total Effects CC Cream, Olay Fresh Effects. In China Yu Lan You Naturals, Pro X Whitening a restage of the Olay brand, new counters and the launch of a new mid-tier brand. So results are improving sequentially and I expect that sequential improvement to continue.","Jon Moeller","I think if you look at, as I mentioned in the share comments Lauren, versus a year-ago you\u2019re absolutely right that Skin Care continues to be a drag in terms of market share being down versus year-ago. We have more work to do there but as Bob indicated, there have been a number of things that have been just recently put out on the market that we hope to drive that behind.","Bob McDonald","China beauty shipments grew double digits this quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan. Please begin.","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Yes, thanks. As we look at lower raw material inflation over the course of calendar 2013, you're going to see less pricing in the category and I guess we're not seeing a volume bounce back which is what's leading to deceleration in overall organic top line growth maybe in these categories. So, can you talk about what you're seeing from an elasticity standpoint as we look at less pricing and how you think that maybe plays out over the course of the year? Thanks.","Bob McDonald","Well, to me John, Jon talked about the fact that in the quarter we saw a half a point reduction in growth versus the previous quarter. I think the economic recovery is going to continue to be choppy as we alluded to in our remarks. And to me the ultimate response is growth through innovation and growth through productivity improvement. We're going to continue to work on the productivity improvement. Jon talked about the fact we're ahead of the pace that we expected to be at this point in time. Some of that productivity improvement will fall to the bottom line, some of that productivity improvement will fuel the launch of the new innovations and the new market category combinations. And as Jon said, we're not pulling back. We've introduced 30 new category country combinations this year and we're going to continue to do that. Jon went through a litany of those including the broad global expansion of our oral care business. So we're expecting sequential improvement in the top line driven by innovation. And we're expecting continued sequential improvement in market share just as we tried to indicate with this quarter's report.","Operator","You're next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Bob, I just wanted to focus on the top line. The two-year average organic sales growth decelerated in the quarter versus Q2 and last year despite the higher marketing and the greater innovation. And it looks like it was even rounded up to get to 3%. I know you mentioned weaker market growth, but how comfortable are you that you're getting a solid ROI on the investments you're making in marketing and innovation and the other areas given the lack of a top line payback this quarter? And second more importantly to broaden out the question longer term, it seems like in recent history you've been a bit at mercy of variances in market growth of the competitive environment from the top line perspective, obviously that will impact any company but market share has only improved modestly here sequentially in the last couple of quarters despite the price adjustment. So, can you take us through some more detail on what you're doing internally from a market share standpoint to manage through the external environment and you're level of confidence that you can sustainably turnaround market share as we look out over the next couple of years here?","Bob McDonald","Yeah, Dara, I'm very confident in our sequential improvement and market share driven by innovation. I would differ with your characterization. I think we've made substantial progress in increasing the percent of our business growing market share and I think that ties pretty directly to the innovations you've seen. I mean a classic example is the fact that the Tide PODS is helping us grow laundry market share in the U.S. and it's only on one brand and one country, and it's worth $0.5 billion of top line. I think we're on the early days of seeing these innovations have a broader impact globally and that will translate to an accelerated growth on the top line. We're continuing to invest in innovation, we've increased the spending on research and development the past three years, we're going to continue to make sure that we're building the capability to keep that innovation going. And the results in the marketplace are demonstrating that we're executing with excellence today more so perhaps than the previous periods you were talking about. So I'm confident we're going to continue this sequential improvement and you'll see it in the share and you'll see it in the top line.","Jon Moeller","I share Bob's confidence. If you just step back over the last couple of years as we\u2019ve discussed many times from a geographic standpoint the one market that we weren\u2019t growing and that we needed to grow in was North America, and that's obviously a large part of our business. And if you just look at the percentage of businesses holding or growing share there, growing from 15% in the June quarter to 55% in the first half of this fiscal year to two-thirds in the March quarter to over 70% in the month of March, that gives us a lot of confidence that we are on the right trail here.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. You may begin.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","Hi good morning. My question is on \u2026","Bob McDonald","Hi. Wendy.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi Investment Research","\u2026the gross margin and the expansion slowed significantly I think on a sequential basis and you called out sort of the start-up cost within new production facilities. So is that all of the plans coming online in the emerging markets for is that also just innovation stuff that's launching in the U.S.? And if it is the emerging markets, is that something that's going to be here to stay for the next couple of quarters or do we think gross margins going to re-accelerate with the better commodity backdrop? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Wendy. It is both of the things you mentioned. It's emerging market, start-up of localized manufacturing in emerging markets, it is also the start-up of manufacturing operations to support our innovations in developed markets for example the POD start-up in Europe. Both of those will be with us next quarter and it's one of the reasons that you see some of the trends that you do, but I don't expect this to be an ongoing dynamic. This should be another quarter or two. ","Bob McDonald","One of the things we have worked hard on Wendy is ramping up our process reliability as vertically as we can when we start up a new plant and process reliability is in a sense the amount of throughput that you get from a plant versus what you expect and our process reliability as a Company is now at the highest level it's ever been. And that is what's leading, helping to lead to some of the productivity improvements you see in manufacturing productivity, because as we increase the throughput of every single plant we then don't need to buy additional capacity in essence that capacity comes with the productivity improvement. So we're going to continue to work as we start-up these new plants to get the process reliability curve as vertical as possible to minimize those expenses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. Please begin.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, can you just talk about the sort of fourth-quarter guidance and all the reinvestments, you think about you did 3% organic growth in the year-ago quarter, you\u2019ve announced a massive restructuring, you reinvest all this money back into the business, but it seems like organic growth is just going to be flat, so is it really just sort of category growth contraction? And then what would happen if we really did have some commodity inflation, because I think you have like 260 basis points of productivity savings in the quarter and I think that kind of carries forward. So, what sort of the puts and takes in, how long is this negative mix impact going to last? And I know that was a long question, so I apologize.","Bob McDonald","Wow! I\u2019m not quite sure how to cut through that. I will try. So, first of all just let me step back on our guidance philosophy, since your question started with guidance. Last quarter we over delivered our guidance. We increased guidance a little bit, but invested a lot of the money back to ensure that we continue to leverage innovation pipeline we have an sequentially build market share. Effectively this quarter we have done the same thing. We have over delivered by a little bit, we've taken up the bottomline \u2013 the bottom end of the guidance range, but are going to continue to invest to get the share where it needs to be going forward. As we invest to do that and drive higher profitability through productivity I'm confident that the returns will be there, because each case we are growing, it\u2019s worth more and the \u2013 I expect from a commodity standpoint if anything may be a little bit of fairly benign. I don't expect a big impact going forward and so these productivity savings should begin to impact both gross margin and operating margin as they have in prior quarters, particularly when we get beyond the start-up of these new manufacturing facilities that Wendy was describing.","So I see accelerating top line based on continued market share progress, kind of irrespective of market size and the productivity savings over time enabling us to both fuel that and drive our earnings per share growth.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Ferrara from Bank of America. You may begin.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Thanks. Guys, I guess I wanted to try to pull together some of the comments you've made on your confidence in the market share recovery, the timing of the build out of the innovation pipeline, right, because it seems like there's been no shortage of new products at the second half of '13 yet a couple of things. In the Q4, organic guidance implies only flattish markets here at 3 to 4. You're saying momentum was building through the quarter but the Q4 outlook is not even an acceleration from Q3 when you came in at the low end of your organic range. So I get that you're saying it's early days and some progress is made, but wouldn't you have expected that share recovery to have kicked in a little bit more by now and if so, why do you think it has? And if not, why not?","Jon Moeller","Obviously the market share is affected by many factors, Chris, some of which are external, but I would say that all-in-all, as we step back from it, we're on track with what we want to deliver in terms of sequential improvement in market share and we expect that to continue. We expect that to continue in the fourth quarter and we're looking forward to the next fiscal year. The innovations, many of which we've talked about, are one country, one brand and they're supported by a technology platform that we will put across more countries and more brands. I mean we talked about PODS and we talked about the entry of PODS into parts of Europe and the parts of Latin America and the parts of Africa. This is only now starting. We're just now shipping those cases, taking those orders. You're not seeing the impact in the marketplace at all yet. I think by the end of the quarter, you'll obviously see that impact and just like this quarter, it will ramp up through the quarter. And as we've said, March was a much stronger month than the beginning of the quarter and that's why we grew share at the 70% plus of the U.S. business, grew and held share at 70% plus.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nik Modi from UBS. You may begin.","Nik Modi - UBS","Yeah, just quickly on all the innovations to just on how you guys are thinking about the FTU complexity across the business, especially at a time where you're trying to also reduce the cost structure and can provide any thoughts on that? And then just a housekeeping, can you just talk a little bit about the health care business and what was driving such strong growth? Was it just the flu season or was there something else going on there?","Bob McDonald","Well, in terms of innovation and SKU proliferation, our point of view is one where we work with customers and retailers and create joint value creation. We have scorecards that we work with customers and part of that is working efficient assortment where we don't bring an innovation to retailers that we don't think will command or attract a large number of consumers. And while we go in with that new innovation and expect to or try to sell a certain amount of shelf space, at the same time we help retailers pull out, eliminate some of the innovations that other competitors or even we have launched that may not have worked. So we try to keep the SKU proliferation under control. I think I would point to our manufacturing productivity. Our manufacturing productivity and our work on inventory which is turning in great cash results wouldn't be where it is if there was evidence that we were [prolifering] SKUs. At the same time, I'd encourage you to look at some at the new items that we launched by some of our competitors that haven't done well and we'll be working with retailers to try to get the shelf space back, so the retailers can make money off that shelf space.","Jon Moeller","In terms of health care, there are really three drivers, Chris. So one you rightly cite which is the strong cold flu season. The second is the expansion of the Vicks line up in Eastern Europe that we've talked about before. And the third is a real strong quarter on the P&G (indiscernible) business as we continue to drive the products of that joint venture. So those are the three main drivers of our health care progress.","Bob McDonald","Do you mention ZzzQuil? I would also mention the launch of ZzzQuil which is multiples beyond our expectation and success. It's already the number one branded sleep aid, it's expanded the category. ZzzQuil is off to a tremendous start and I would recommend it for all of you who may suffer jet lag if you travel internationally.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. You may begin.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Hey, guys. So, I think like a lot of other people on the call, I\u2019m kind of struggling with the dichotomy between the positive tone of your press release, the confidence you\u2019re clearly exhibiting on this call, all the very, very enticing innovations that are out there. First is, essentially I think disappointing top-line results at least from investors, analyst and I think you\u2019re seeing that on the stock reaction probably. So, I got a few things; one is how is your share gain related to the slow down in the market growth? Two is; I guess, if everything is going to plan, why is it pretty impossible to get to the high-end of your top-line growth range for the year? And then three is, you say there\u2019s more to come. I\u2019m trying to understand what's -- like are there other bigger things you\u2019re expecting to happen whether it be an incremental reinvestment that you need to make, whether be an acceleration to the chart changes or structure changes or in census structure. What else can get us to feel better to tie in this dichotomy to your confidence and frankly somewhat disappointment when everybody on this call so far asked questions in some of the market right now. Thanks.","Bob McDonald","Well our top-line growth delivery was within our guidance range, Ali. And I think maybe part of the dislocation that you\u2019re perceiving between our confidence and your lack of confidence may be just in time sequence. I mean the innovations we\u2019re talking about as I responded to Chris\u2019s question, are all future oriented and future related and you\u2019re looking at past results. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to do what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in innovation. We\u2019re going to continue to bring out a large number of innovations. We\u2019re going to continue to fuel that with productivity improvement and with investments in innovation. I\u2019m really excited about the work that we\u2019ve done around productivity both in the manufacturing area where we\u2019ve offset the headcount that we need to run 20 new factories, but also in the area of non-manufacturing where we\u2019re ahead of target. And the work that we\u2019ve done already in the productivity area with Jorge Uribe team and his leadership is suggesting that we can get to the 2% to 4% reduction which by the time we get to 2016 could have us down 16% to 22% of enrollment. And I think that\u2019s terrific progress and it gives us a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll have the fuel to then spend behind innovation and get those sequential market share growth goals that we talked about without regard to choppiness of the global economy.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer. You may begin.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning, guys. I guess, since you just mentioned choppiness again Bob, I\u2019ll start there. You guys have talked about that a lot this morning. We\u2019ve heard that from other companies as well. Could you give us a little more color or past anecdotes in terms of what you\u2019re seeing from your customers, where they\u2019re buying and what they\u2019re buying, how often they\u2019re buying, how that\u2019s changed in the quarter perhaps. And then secondly the market share trends obviously are improving, but I think your overall market shares are still down year-over-year, so when would you guys expect to see those overall market share start to grow overall? Thanks.","Bob McDonald","Well let me deal with the year-over-year first, the year-over-year varies by category, by country. For example, year-over-year now in North America we\u2019re obviously seeing growth because we\u2019ve got 70% plus of the business holding or growing share. So obviously with the sequential improvement over time with 50% plus now holding or growing share globally we\u2019re going to expect to see a year-over-year growth sequentially in the coming quarters. Relative to the choppiness of the economy it's more of an evolution I think then a cathartic revolution. What we\u2019re seeing is obviously retailer\u2019s concerned about their level of inventory and their cash investment. We see them worrying about attracting traffic to their stores, but we don't see extraordinary levels of promotion like we may have in 2009, 2010, but there are times where there are extraordinary levels of promotion. For example when we launched Vidal Sassoon and Pantene Expert and one of our competitors launched a new brand, the third competitor who did not have very strong innovation program this quarter put instantly redeemable coupons on all of their hair care offerings in every store. So you do see choppiness in that regard. The promotion spending when you don't have innovation, but the rest I would see as evolutionary but an improvement in the way retailers are operating. Another point that you see is the move to online or ecommerce. We've been working hard to understand what our market share is in ecommerce. We've been putting a lot of resources against it. I'll just give you the U.S. example, if you take our U.S. market share, our ecommerce digital market share both through bricks and mortar and through digital players is 20 points higher than it is through regular retail. And this was a fast growing channel, so that may lead to also some of the choppiness that you may see because most of that, that sale is not transparent to the marketplace.","Bob McDonald","But if we're going to continue to operate in an environment that is a little bit choppy, I think we're extraordinarily well positioned from a standpoint of both the productivity program and the innovation program which are the antidotes to this kind of market environment.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets. Please begin.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. Another question on market shares. If U.S. shares are growing in 65% to 70% of your businesses and your shares are growing in 75% of businesses in China, but your worldwide shares are growing 50% -- and 50% worldwide. In which international markets are you losing share and why? And when would you expect to turn?","Bob McDonald","Well, Connie, first of all we said that holding and growing share not just growing. And that's a significant difference. Places we're losing market share, frankly we've talked about the work we're doing on skin care globally and trying to improve our [VT] business. That's a major focus for us. Brush laundry, we were losing some share and we've put a plan in place to regain share. So we have pockets like that around the world, but believe me we are all focused on turning those shares around and doing it through innovation.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. You may begin.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Good morning, everyone. I would like to come back to beauty and the choppiness and again, the market in a spending and the innovation that you're talking about. If you step back, you did major launches in the U.S. in Olay, in hair care, in makeup with COVERGIRL and yet we don't see any traction from it. So I understand that L'Oreal did a competitive launch but under the same choppiness, they grew 5.5% in the quarter on GVU contracted minus 1%. So what I'm hearing is doing the same thing, spending more and doing the same innovation, blaming competitive activity in terms of the lack of traction that shouldn't you be thinking about doing things differently so that there is more effectiveness in the A&P spending and on the innovation? Thank you.","Bob McDonald","Javier, we understand. We see it a little bit differently than you do. We launched these items, recently they\u2019re making sequential progress. We talked about Vidal Sassoon already approaching a two value share which is double our pre-launch estimates at this point in time. These things are making progress period-to-period. Pantene Expert for example has a higher repurchase rate than our competitor\u2019s new brand. So we\u2019re seeing progress period-to-period and we think that will be reflected in the market share results and the top-line growth sequentially as we said.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning. Just, I mean, I\u2019m not going to use the word complexity, because I think it's been over used a little bit. But I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out when you\u2019re looking at all the innovation that you\u2019re bringing out and the top-line growth that\u2019s coming through. Can you talk about some of what I would consider as the non-core businesses in the portfolio. Obviously we know its for the 2010 the area that you\u2019re focusing on and where you\u2019re playing to win. But it just seems like there is some volatility with some of these non-core businesses that you guys, I think are not continuing disposing at time. So I was just wondering when you see the results that are coming through and the great innovation that you\u2019re getting and some of what I would consider more core businesses, does that change your outlook in terms of keeping other brands in the portfolio or kind of, I think one of the last questions was on the SKU complexity, kind of eliminating that so you can put up healthier numbers and seeing the results of better innovation in some of the core brands? Thanks.","Bob McDonald","Jason, as you know we have quite a robust process for weeding and feeding our portfolio and we have divested businesses in the past. We are happy with our portfolio that we have today. And any item in our portfolio, there is an expectation that we innovate. Jon, went through the innovation for example that we have in Pet Care coming to market, good for you and the (indiscernible) item. We have innovation in Duracell another category that you\u2019ve asked us about in the past, in (indiscernible) with a 10-year guarantee on Powermat. So, we expect to innovate into every one of our businesses. There maybe a different cycle of innovation, a need for that, but we expect to innovate in every one of our businesses and that\u2019s the primary way that we attract consumers and grow our business.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. You may begin.","William Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Good morning. Just wanted to dig back into the PODS in the U.S. and certainly half a billion in sales and improving market shares in great, but just if you could give us some color of after being out in the market for a year, I mean, is the six household penetration, where you expected better or worse, and I mean can you get to 10 in the near term and do you need to have gain PODS or something else to really kind of jumpstart the category even further? Thanks.","Bob McDonald","Thank you, Bill. With the technology like Tide PODS, we usually start with the leading brand and then we expand that technology across countries and across brands. What we\u2019ve seen with PODS is that it's a preferred form of laundry detergent. And people who move from a powder to a liquid historically now move from a liquid to a POD, and they typically don\u2019t go backwards. Once you start using a POD you don\u2019t go back to a liquid. Once you\u2019ve moved to a liquid you don\u2019t go back to a powder and that just is the generational shift in the laundry category. I think one of the things that\u2019s been interesting about PODS is its attracted users even though it has a higher cost per load. It's attracted users across the entire spectrum of users, across the entire spectrum of income. So, there are many, many people who are forced to over dose their laundry detergent today because they aren\u2019t getting satisfactory cleaning and they buy a low priced brand, that brand doesn\u2019t work, it has a low level of actives, has a lot of water and so they overdose. And they move to this form which cleans better and they find it more economical even though it has a higher cost per use. The reason the cost per use is higher is you\u2019re not paying for water, you're paying for active ingredients. So, I think it surprised us a little bit to see where the source of volume has come from. If you look at the track of what percent of the business this has become, we said that we think we'll get to 30 eventually because of what we've seen in dishwashing over time and automatic dishwashing, and we have no data to refute that. This is \u2013 it's going to be an evolution over time but as we expand the form about the world, you'll see a higher proportion of our laundry business go into PODS and eventually I think we'll get near the 30% number that dishwashing has.","Jon Moeller","And don't forget that we were constrained in terms of supply until just recently, so we'll be increasing the levels of marketing of in-store support. So to your point of driving a higher household penetration, that's still ahead of us.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel Nicolaus. You may begin.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I wanted to go back to the underperformance in beauty and try to think about it a little bit differently. What do you think has led to some of the underperformance? And when do you think the innovation-based strategy potentially needs to shift or how do you sort of evaluate the efficacy of what you're doing? And then sort of related to that, how do you think about supplementing the internal innovation with acquisitions externally? And then sort of related to that, how do you think, Jon, about the optimal leverage structure on an overall basis for the business? And does the cost savings program limit the acquisition appetite overall?","Bob McDonald","Well, we've been working to strengthen the organization, strengthen the business now for some time. We're starting to see progress. As we reported in this quarter, we've launched a number of new innovations and the innovation program looks even stronger in the future. We have more what we call bigger change innovations coming in the future and we're excited about that. So I expect \u2013 as I've said, I expect the performance of the beauty organization to improve quarter-to-quarter and sequentially and we're going to continue to invest in it both in terms of innovation and in terms of marketing.","Jon Moeller","And we've said before that we're interested \u2013 we continue to be interested and fill in acquisitions, that would be true in beauty as well. I don't think there's anything that holds us back from that at this point except asset availability and asset attractiveness, but that's something that we'll continue to look at. There's really no constraint within either our leverage targets or our earnings projections to the activities should something attractive present itself.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research. You may begin.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Hi, good morning. I have a housekeeping question and then my real question. My first is could you just tell us why you're category growth rate was by region, emerging markets, U.S. and Europe? And then my real question is on Tide in the U.S. I know it's not suffering the price reversal in powders that some of the others are. Could you tell us how much Tide as a brand overall was up or down in the quarter if you include powders, liquids and PODS together? Thanks.","Bob McDonald","Let me take the first one, Alice. In terms of the market growth rates, developed markets in our categories grew about 1 point. Developing markets were up about 7 points leaving us with a global total of about 3.5 points which compares to 4 points in the prior quarter. Now within that, you asked about the U.S., the U.S. was up about 2.5 points with Europe down and Japan essentially flat.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","And Tide?","Jon Moeller","Hi, Alice. Jon Moeller here. Tide was down in the quarter from a shipment standpoint. If you recall that this is the quarter that we're comping the PODS launch, so the underlying trends again from a market share standpoint are very strong, shipments are down year-over-year only because of the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joe Lachky from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo Securities","Thank you. I was wondering if you could outline your opportunities and efforts you're making on working capital specifically inventory I think you mentioned that briefly, but also payables and receivables and remind me if you\u2019ve quantified how much opportunity you see there and how you plan to use that cash either reinvest in your business or potentially return additional cash to shareholders?","Bob McDonald","So we\u2019re actively working on inventory days on hand, and our goal is to be able to reduce working capital by sufficient levels to be able to offset the increase in capital spending behind the developing market expansion such that we continue to deliver 90% free cash flow productivity, which gives us ample cash to return to shareholders and that's exactly what we're doing now. We are on target in terms of a pretty significant reduction in inventory days on hand this year. We're targeting again the same next year and I'll let Teri briefly talk about what we\u2019re doing on payables.","Teri List-Stoll","Yeah, so there has been some press recently about a new program that we've introduced with suppliers, how supply chain finance. We were partnering with some of our world-class banking partners to be able to present what we think is a win-win solution to suppliers. As part of that, will be extending our payment terms which obviously frees up cash for us, so we are offering lower cash financings and actually a rear access that cash to our suppliers as part of that program. So that\u2019s something that we think over time and we are implementing it over time so it is not disruptive to suppliers. That will free up a tremendous amount of cash starting next year and then over the next two, three years.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Steib from Credit Suisse. You may proceed.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Good morning. You made several references towards investing behind marketing spending, could you be a bit more specific please? What does that mean, does that mean that ad spent for example is up sequentially in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales?","Bob McDonald","Yes.","Jon Moeller","Yes.","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Bob McDonald","It also means we are investing in things like sampling \u2013 door to door sampling, selling, things that will generate trial and awareness of the new innovations.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser from B. Riley Caris & Company. You may begin.","Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley Caris","Hi. My question is on cash flow. You had 20% year-over-year growth in operating cash flow in the first half of the fiscal year and it was only up slightly in the third quarter. So is there \u2013 is your working capital performance actually deteriorating a little bit or is there some other strange comparisons that happened in the quarter? And also, it looks like in the quarter you pay down, reduced debt by about $800 million or so. Is there any reason why you cant just maintain the debt that you added into the balance sheet in the first half and use, instead of paying down debt in the second half just do more share repurchase. Would that put you over \u2013 would that not allow you to maintain your credit ratings as you would like or what\u2019s the reason that you cant just maintain that a little bit additional leverage and repurchase shares, because other companies have levered up a little bit here and are repurchasing more stock. So can you just kind of explain that? Thanks a lot.","Jon Moeller","Sure. Well, stepping way back again, 10 years $98 billion of cash return to shareholders, that\u2019s clearly a focus area. Generated $3 billion of cash in the quarter, so a strong quarter of cash flow, the IR team can take you through the line item comparatives versus the base period. We\u2019ve been using that increase in cash flow to increase our share repurchase. You may recall when we first started talking about share repurchase for the year was $4 billion to $6 billion. We increased that range based on cash over delivery the $5 billion to $6 billion last quarter, this quarter we increased a range again to $6 billion based on cash over delivery. So, we\u2019re very much focused on that objective. And we increased the dividend 7% at the same time as you know.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA. You may begin.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Good morning. Just wondering if you look at your base businesses it may be where a lot of the problems arising, you launch new products in Hair Care, but the base Pantene must be where the weaknesses I\u2019m assuming similar with liquid Tide and the Olay product. So is this something with all the innovation as we talk about and do is there some way one can address the base business to make sure that there isn\u2019t that kind of erosions, that\u2019s my first question. I was also wondering if you could just talk about your diaper share in the top few markets there, I\u2019m not sure I quote what trends alike in diapers anywhere in your big markets?","Bob McDonald","Caroline, we\u2019re very focused on growing the base business. Without growing the base business, there is no growth. And I think evidence of that is the fact that we\u2019re holding or drawing share in 70% of the U.S. business in the month of March. The innovations are helping, but you couldn\u2019t do that without growing the base business. And so we evaluate people on drawing the base business, its important to us and we know we cant grow without growing the base business and that\u2019s particularly true in developed markets like the United States, but its also true in developing markets. So, we\u2019re focused on that and that\u2019s why market share is such an important measure for us.","Operator","And at this time, we have no other questions in the queue.

Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.Jon MoellerThanks. Good morning, everyone. I am here this morning with Bob McDonald and Teri List-Stoll. The second quarter results we released this morning were good at the high end of our initial forecast on the top line and well ahead of the forecast on operating profit, earnings per share, and cash flow. These better than expected results will enable us to raise our sales, earnings per share, and share repurchase outlook for the fiscal year while and this is important simultaneously strengthening our innovation and marketing plans in the back half.Organic sales grew a strong 3% which was at the high end of our 1% to 3% guidance range. Organic volume grew 2 points and pricing added 2 points to organic sales growth. Product and geographic mix reduced sales by 1 point. Organic sales growth was broad-based with all segments up 2% or more for the quarter. Foreign exchange impacts lowered sales growth by 1 point leaving all-in sales up 2%, a point above the high end of the guidance range. Global market share trends have continued to improve. We held or grew market share in businesses representing nearly 50% of sales in the December quarter, up from 45% of sales in the September quarter and 30% in the June quarter. We have more work to do, but the underlying trends are improving.Moving to the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $1.39, ahead of our guidance range of $1.18 to $1.25 per share. All-in earnings include $0.21 of non-core holding gains from the purchase of the balance of our Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia, which we completed in October and $0.05 of non-core restructuring investments to drive productivity improvement. Core earnings per share were $1.22, up 12% versus the prior year, much stronger than we had initially forecast. The better than expected earnings were driven by top of range sales growth, strong productivity savings, and a small pick up from a higher than expected gain on the divestiture of our Western European bleach business.Core operating profit margin grew 110 basis points, including 160 basis points of productivity improvements and cost savings. Core gross margin also improved 110 basis points. Cost savings and productivity helped gross margin by 100 basis points and pricing improved gross margin by roughly 90 basis points. These benefits were partially offset by a 100 basis point negative impact from a combination of product and geographic mix. Commodity costs were essentially neutral to gross margin for the quarter.Core SG&A costs were in line with the prior year as a percentage of sales. Overhead cost savings of approximately 60 basis points were offset by increased plans and benefits costs and modestly higher marketing spending. The core tax rate was 24.4% slightly below the prior year level. That impact on the year-to-year change in the tax rate was about $0.01 on the quarter. On an all-in basis, including restructuring costs gross margin improved 80 basis points and SG&A costs were in line with the prior year as a percentage of sales. All-in operating profit margin improved by 800 basis points driven by non-core charges taken in the base period.We generated $3.1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, which was also ahead of our initial forecast. We expect to deliver around 90% cash flow productivity for the year. During the quarter, we returned $3 billion of cash to shareholders, $1.6 billion in dividends, and $1.4 billion in share repurchase.During the first half of the fiscal year, we have returned $7.2 billion to shareholders, $3.2 billion in dividends and $4 billion in share repurchase. These second quarter results combined with those of the first quarter enabled us to raise our outlook on the top line, bottom line, and on share repurchase, while simultaneously strengthening plans. We are continuing to make progress on the productivity plan we outlined at the CAGNY Conference last February, and on the growth priorities we discussed at the Citi Conference last May. Our priorities continue to be maintaining strong developing market momentum, strengthening our core developed market business, building a strong innovation pipeline, and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvements.We maintain growth momentum in the developing markets in the December quarter with organic sales up 7%. BRIC markets were up 11% led by Brazil and India with organic sales growth of over 20%. And an important component of our developing market plans is continued expansion of our portfolio. The globalization of our Oral Care portfolio has been one part of this. We have entered the Oral Care category in 34 countries over the last 4 years. Every market is delivering at or above our going-in expectations for both sales and market share.Progress on some of the early expansion markets continues to be very strong. In Brazil, Oral Care shipments were up more than 50% in the December quarter driven by the launch of 3D White toothpastes, Whitestrips, and the benefit of full national distribution. We are growing in all channels and across all forms in the oral care category in Brazil. Oral-B toothpaste share is now fast approaching 9% on a national basis, up nearly 3 points versus a year ago.Additional oral care geographic expansions are planned this calendar year including a lunch in Australia in a few weeks. Another example is Gillette Guard, a breakthrough value tier system razor, which has been a big success in India. We expanded Guard to Egypt last quarter and we are testing it in other developing markets where double-edge blades are still the predominant shaving tool.We are continuing to build scale in developing markets which is enabling solid profit growth. We are localizing production with lower supply chain costs and we are improving the productivity of our SG&A spending as these businesses grow. These are two important drivers of the profit improvement we expect to deliver in our top ten developing markets this year. In aggregate, we expect after-tax profit in these ten markets to increase by about 35% versus last year, including negative foreign exchange impacts. And around 50% on a local currency basis.We are doing all of this while increasing marketing spending and accelerating the pace of innovation. While we are being appropriately choice full, we are in no way pulling back in developing markets, to the contrary we are moving strongly forward. At the same time we are strengthening our core developed markets business. We are ensuring that we have sufficient plans to achieve our objectives in the 40 largest category country combinations, most of which are in developed markets. These businesses account for about 50% of the company's sales and 70% of operating profit.The interventions we made during the last calendar year in four core U.S. categories are continuing to drive strong results. In the U.S. laundry detergents, value share has been progressively improving following the consumer value corrections on the Gain brand and the growth of Tide Pods. Value share for U.S. detergents are up sequentially on a past 12, 6, 3 and 1 month basis. Tide\u2019s share is in the high 30s, up 1.5 point versus prior year. And Gain value share is back to 15% for the first time in over a year.Market share results in the U.S. auto dishwashing detergents have also improved sequentially. Past three month Cascade value share is now at 60%, up 1.5 point versus prior year. Gillette\u2019s share is up nearly 2 points at 74% in the U.S. mail blades and razors category. The Fusion franchise is up more than a point at 37.5% and MACH3 is in line with prior year at about 21%. In U.S. oral care, Crest toothpaste\u2019s market leading value share is about 36% in line with prior year levels. Across the U.S. business, we held or built share in businesses representing nearly 60% of sales.We have seen strong sequential improvement in the share trends across our top 20 brands in the U.S. On a past 12 month basis, only 25% of the top 20 brands were holding a growing share. That figure is up to 60% on a past three month basis and 65% for the most recent period in the United States. January marks the first months of full planned deployment. And innovation strengthens as the year progresses. So we expect further improvement in market share results in the back half of the fiscal year.Innovation underpins both developed and developing market efforts, as is our work to drive greater productivity in everything we do. On the point of innovation, Tide PODS have reached a 6% value share in less than a year. We expect PODS will generate about $0.5 billion of sales this fiscal year on one brand in one country. Tide PODS deliver as much cleaning power as [6x] leading competitive unit dose products combined. A big reason we currently hold a 75% share of the unit dose form.We have now established PODS capacity in Europe and will began the roll out of Ariel PODS in April. Additional markets and brands will follow. We have driven the growth in a new category with Downy UNSTOPABLES in-wash scent boosters. UNSTOPABLES keep cloths fresh for up to 12-weeks until you were them. UNSTOPABLES consumption is nearly twice as high as we had initially expected. We launched a new spring scent earlier this month to further expand the UNSTOPABLES line up. We are marketing this innovation in only three countries so far. The U.S., Canada, and Japan.Our air care business just introduce Febreze Stick and Refresh, which Febreze\u2019s unique slow release scent technology with a no-residue adhesive from our connect and develop innovation partner, 3M. Febreze Stick and Refresh sticks to any surface and works anywhere in your home to keep it fresh and odor free without plugs or batteries. The surface care category launched a Swiffer with gain scent line extension to provide consumers with the fresh scent of gain as they clean with Swiffer Dusters, Wet Jet, and Sweepers. Swiffer is a good example of the benefits of scale and innovation coupling our substrate and perfume expertise with the strong brand equity from our laundry category to obsolete mops, feather dusters, and rags. Cascade Platinum launched earlier this month, this follows the successful launch of Fairy Platinum in Western Europe earlier this year. Cascade and Fairy Platinum are designed to deliver powerful cleaning for dishes while also providing film protection to help maintain the sparkling look of dishwasher interiors.Next month, we have three new things to communicate on Bounty. On the main Bounty lineup, we will be announcing towels that are two times more absorbent than the next leading national brand. We are upgrading Bounty Basic with towels that are 50% stronger than the leading bargain Brand. And we are launching a new line called BOUNTY DURATOWEL letting consumers ditch their dish cloth and switch to BOUNTY DURATOWEL, which is three times cleaner than their dirty dish cloth.Our entry into the sleep aids category continues to go very well. ZzzQuil is a non-habit forming sleep-aid that was not for colds, not for pain, just for sleep. ZzzQuil has grown to nearly 20% value share in the U.S. sleep aids category making it the number one brand in sleep aid in terms of both units and value in the U.S. We began expanding ZzzQuil into Canada earlier this month. The expansion of Vicks Cough & Cold products in Russia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic is also progressing well. The launch features for the Vicks Nature Fusion line that combines effective medicine with the soothing experience of natural remedies. Sales in the expansion markets are ahead of initial expectations.Oral Care launched its Oral-B Deep Sweep power brush two weeks ago. Deep Sweep cleans like a power brush and moves like a manual brush to remove more than two times the plaque of a regular manual toothbrush. 3D White toothpaste has now delivered market share growth in the U.S. every month since its introduction over two and a half years ago. We are expanding the 3D White line, which includes toothpaste, brush, rinse, floss, and Whitestrips around the world to continue building out our full Oral Care portfolio. Over the last nine months, we launched 3D White products in the UK, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, China, Brazil, and Mexico. 3D White is driving strong share growth in Mexico and the UK. Mexico reached an all-time high toothpaste value share of over 14% for the quarter, up nearly four points versus the prior year. In the UK, the combination of 3D White Oral-B Complete and Oral-B Pro-Expert drove value share to over 10%, up nearly three points versus the prior year.Salon hair-care\u2019s Illumina Color from Wella Professional launched in Western Europe in July and in North America in December. Illumina leverages a new patented micro-light technology and as well as biggest innovation in the last 20 years. With Wella consumers experience hair that appears lit from within. This breakthrough innovation we will be launching in Latin America, in Australia, New Zealand in March.U.S. Skin Care began shipping Olay Total Effect CC or Color Correction Cream in December. Total Effect CC Cream fights the seven signs of aging to correct fine lines, wrinkles, and age spots and covers to provide a flawlessly beautiful complexion. This month, they also introduced some new mid-tier Skin Care boutiques called Olay Fresh Effects aimed at younger consumers with a collection of cleansers and moisturizers that deep clean and hydrate to keep you looking beautifully fresh and vibrant.We have also begun revitalization of Olay Regenerist with the launch of new Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream. The reformulation includes two new anti-aging ingredients to penetrate quickly and regenerate surface cells to reveal younger looking skin fast. Visible wrinkle reduction starts in just one day and the look of 10 years of wrinkles can be reduced in just four weeks.The COVERGIRL brand introduced two exciting innovations during the last quarter. The new Clump Crusher Mascara by LashBlast provides 200% more volume with zero clumps. COVERGIRL mascara sales growth has accelerated by 9 points since the Clump Crusher launch. Also COVERGIRL has entered the nails segment with the new Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Gloss. This line has 45 shades that provide high gloss color that can last as long as a week without the need for a top coat. Initial results for COVERGIRL nails are very strong, one leading drug customer sales have exceeded market leader Maybelline\u2019s after just six weeks in market.We are currently launching a Hair Care innovation bundle that spans the vertical portfolio. We recently launched Pantene Expert Collection which includes two super-premium lines, Age Defy and Advanced+ Keratin Repair, priced 200%-250% above the base Pantene line. Age Defy leverages a new formula based on our hair biology program, yielding hair that acts ten years younger by thickening hair as if it had 6500 new strands.The Pantene Advanced+ Keratin Repair formula leverages a breakthrough in new conditioner technology to repair two years of hair damage in two minutes. We are expanding Pantene Expert Collection to Latin America later this quarter. We are also launching Vidal Sassoon Pro series in the U.S., a complete hair care line offering shampoo, conditioner, styling and permanent color, to give salon genius brilliantly prices. Vidal Sassoon Pro series is priced at a 50 to 75 index to the base Pantene shampoos and conditioners providing us with a very strong brand in the salon affordable segment with a real salon heritage.We are bringing a bundle of Gillette innovations to market across Fusion and MACH3 blades and razors  as well as shave preps, which is focused on sensitive skin. 70% of men believe they have sensitive skin and these innovations leverage the fact that our ProGlide products have been recommended by dermatologists in the U.S. as the best shave for sensitive skin.Like  innovation, productivity also underpins all of our developed and developing market efforts. We are making strong progress against our commitments but won't stop there. The overhead reduction plan we announced last February called for  a reduction in non-manufacturing staffing of 10%, or roughly 5,700 roles by the end of this fiscal year. As of the end of December, we have reduced 5,500 roles, more than 95% of our target reduction. It\u2019s likely that we will reach our initial staffing objective four to  five months ahead of schedule. And as we announced at our analyst day meeting in November, we are committed to do more.Our new objective is to further reduce and this is what we introduced in analyst day in November, the further reduction of non-manufacturing enrollment by additional 2% to 4% per year from fiscal year 2014 through 2016. This will roughly double the amount of direct savings we deliver in core SG&A reducing our reliance on top line growth for leverage driven savings. Any additional enrollment progress we make in fiscal 2013 beyond our initial target will give us a head start on the fiscal 2014 to 2016 enrollment objectives.We have solid plans in place to deliver $1.2 billion in savings this fiscal year in cost to goods sold. So I have established a stretched target beyond this of $1.4 billion. Our efforts in this area include a 5% net productivity increase across our manufacturing operations, even as we add new manufacturing capacity and enrollments in developing markets. For the first half of the year we are tracking well ahead of target at about 6.5% manufacturing productivity improvement.We are achieving efficiencies in marketing spend, particularly on non-media expenditures and are reinvesting these savings and strengthen plans. As we embrace our cost savings work, we must and will keep our eye on the overriding objective of shareholder value creation, with growth being an important part of this. At the end of last fiscal year, our core operating profit margin was nearly 19%, which compares to a simple average of 15 competitors of about 15.9%. Our operating margins is higher than 12 of the 15. This means we are effectively more leveraged to growth than most of our competitors. And there is significant value creation to be delivered through growth.In our endeavor to cut costs, we will not compromise our growth prospects or capabilities. We are building and executing our strategy with the objective of getting this savings and growth balance right.Now I will turn to our update on outlook for fiscal 2013 and the January-March quarter. Starting with the fiscal year, we are increasing organic sales growth guidance to a range of 3% to 4% compared to our prior range of 2% to 4%. The new range is comprised of volume growth of 2% to 3%, price contribution of about 2%, and negative mix of around 1%. We now expect all-in sales growth of 1% to 2%. This includes a foreign exchange headwind of about 2 points based on mid-January spot rates.We are raising our outlook for core earnings per share growth to a range of 3% to 6% from a previous range of down 1% to up 4%. This guidance includes earnings per share headwinds from items such as higher cost for pensions and employee benefit plans and the impact of mandate in price reductions Venezuela. Combined, these headwinds are reducing our core earnings per share growth rate by about 3 percentage points. Adjust for these, our core earnings per share growth would be 6% to 9% for the year.The new earnings outlook equates to a core earnings per share range of $3.97 to $4.07, which compares to our previous guidance range of $3.80 to $4 per share. There are two items that we called out as potential risks last quarter, which have largely been resolved with no material impact to earnings. We have managed through the absorbent gelling material supply issue for our diaper business, with only minor disruption in added costs. And the U.S. corporate tax extenders that we have assumed in our forecast have now been enacted into law.There continue to be two notable earnings risks that are not included in our guidance. Our forecast is based on mid-January foreign exchange spot rates. A large devaluation of an important currency such as the Venezuelan Bolivar would likely reduce our earnings outlook. Our guidance also assumes current market growth rates continue for the balance of this fiscal year and are not impacted by the payroll tax increase in the U.S., dynamics associated with the U.S. debt ceiling debate, or by worsening conditions in Europe.We are increasing the all-in earnings per share range to $4.04 to $4.14, which compares to our prior range of $3.78 to $4.02 per share. The increase is largely due to the improvement in our core earnings per share expectations. In addition, the $0.21 non-core holding gain resulting from our purchase of the balance of our Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia is roughly $0.04 per share higher than anticipated in our last guidance.We have updated our estimates for non-core restructuring investments which we now expect to be approximately $0.15 per share for the fiscal year. This compares to our previous estimate of $0.15 to $0.19 per share. The difference is driven by a timing shift for asset disposals and somewhat lower cost for organizational productivity improvements. We continue to expect free cash flow productivity of about 90% of net earnings for the year. We now expect capital spending to be around 5% of sales for the year, down from our prior estimate of 5.5%. This reduction is mainly due to capital efficiency and manufacturing productivity improvements, not a reduction in project scope. We expect to continue our 122-year track record of dividend payments and our 56-year track record of dividend increases. The exact amount of the increase is subject to Board approval and will be determined by the Board during the April Board meeting.In addition, we will repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion of stock this fiscal year. Based on current cash projections, we expect to be towards the high end of this range. This has improved from the $4 billion to $6 billion outlook we discussed at the Analyst Meeting in November. Combined, we expect to return $11 billion to $12 billion of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2013. This represents a cash return in the range of 5.8% to 6.3% on our market cap of about $190 billion.For the January to March quarter, we are estimating organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. At the low end of 3%, this range represents growth in line with what we delivered for the December quarter. At the high end of 4%, this range represents another quarter of sequential improvement. Foreign exchange is expected to be roughly neutral to sales growth, which leads to all-in sales growth guidance equal to the organic range of 3% to 4%. On the bottom line, we expect March quarter core earnings per share in the range of $0.91 to $0.97 or down 3% to up 3% compared to prior year core earning per share of $0.94. We expect the effective tax rate for the March quarter to be about a point lower than last year due to the true up needed to reflect the U.S. corporate tax law changes made in early January.For the fiscal year, we now expect the tax rate on core earnings to be around the prior year level of 24.2%. On an all-in basis, we estimate earnings per share in the range of $0.90 to $0.96. This includes non-core restructuring charges of approximately $0.01 a share. Our back half earnings per share guidance reflects the strong level of innovation activity going into the market as well as focused reinvestments to maintain positive market share momentum. We expect the majority of these investments to be in marketing spending with the balance focused on trial building merchandizing programs behind our new innovations.Comparing our first half core earnings per share growth to the back half, we expect marketing investments to be an 8 to 9 point headwind and tax to be a 2 to 3 point headwind. We are offsetting a portion of this with stronger top-line results and higher cost savings, but back half core earnings per share growth will be several points below the first half level.In summary, our second quarter results were on track with our plan on the top line and ahead of plan on operating profit, earnings per share, and cash. These results were enabling us to raise our sales, earnings, and share repurchase outlook for the fiscal year, while creating flexibility to further strengthen our plans in the second half.We remain confident that our focus areas, maintaining momentum in developing markets, strengthening our core developed market business, building a strong innovation pipeline, and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvements, are the right ones and should generate overtime the kind of earnings progress that will put us among the best in our industry. This combined with strong cash flow and a track record of capital returns to shareholders should enable us to generate superior level of shareholder return.That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which we have posted on our website www.pg.com following the call. Bob, Teri and I will be happy to take your questions and the IR team will be available after the call to provide additional perspective as needed. With that why don\u2019t we turn to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America. Please proceed.Chris Ferrara \u2013 Bank of AmericaGuys, I guess the question is about the sales acceleration. And so obviously the sheer number of new products you guys are launching is much higher than what we have seen more recently. And that alone is going to drive better sales and market share, but I guess, can you give us a sense for why specifically you think that we are truly seeing the impact of higher quality innovation that might lead to more sustainable sales growth. And why it\u2019s not just a result of, you just accelerated activity that isn\u2019t necessarily sustainable?Bob McDonaldWell I think Chris, Tide PODS is a great example of that. You know we introduced Tide PODS which is a very discontinuous innovation. It\u2019s take about three quarters of the unit dose category in the United States. When we look at the consumers that it\u2019s gaining, it\u2019s gaining consumers from up and down the income spectrum. So even though it might be priced as a premium on a per wash basis, you have got consumers who would buy lower priced brands, trading up to that innovation.And as Jon said in his remarks, we expect by the end of the year this will be $0.5 billion business. So you take a $0.5 billion of new business on one innovation, one discontinuous innovation, one country, one brand. And as Jon said, we have already built the plan. We are expanding in Western Europe in the April through June quarter. So you can just imagine the sales and earnings potential of just that one discontinuous innovation as we expanded around the world. I think that\u2019s probably the best example.Jon MoellerAnd you will also remember Chris, I think, in our analyst day discussion in Bruce Brown\u2019s presentation on innovation, we talked about an acceleration we are expecting on what we referred to as change innovation, which goes beyond commercial activity to truly change the consumer experience and the dynamics of a category. So we do think we are on a much stronger innovation footing as we go forward.Bob McDonaldAnd of course there are new categories we have entered too. Jon mentioned the ZzzQuil in sleep aids. We entered the auto care fragrance category. And as we also talked, we have bolstered our new category innovation as well and we fully expect some of those innovations to come to market over the next year or so.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.Dara Mohsenian - Morgan StanleySo the increase in the low-end of the organic sales growth guidance for the full year, can you discuss where we have come in better than expected on a geographic basis and what\u2019s driving that confidence in general. And then it looks like in emerging markets, the sales growth has slowed more like to 7% range in the last couple of quarters versus 10% over the past couple of years. So is that more just the category growth issue with macro slowing a bit or is it a market share issue? Can you talk about a few expected emerging markets to reaccelerate in the back half of the year?Bob McDonaldRelative to geography there, we are really seeing growth both in developed markets and developing markets. Recall two of our four focus areas are maintaining our momentum in developing markets and developing markets were up 7% this quarter. They were up 11% in the BRIC countries. And if you look at two major countries like China, like India and Brazil, they were up 20%. So we are continuing to grow in developing markets. We are continuing to enter new category country combinations. We will enter 20 this year. We are continuing to build new factories in developing markets, roughly 20 that are on the drawing board now. So, we are growing in developing markets and a lot of that is the expansion of categories like Jon talked Oral Care. A lot of that also is our growing market share. We are also growing in developed markets. We are strengthening our developing market business. As Jon said, we have held or build share in businesses representing nearly 60% of the sales in the quarter in the U.S. and the interventions that we have put in place like in U.S. laundry, U.S. auto dish, U.S. male blades and razors. So, Oral Care as Jon covered are helping us to get our shares back to the point that we think they should be. So, it\u2019s really broad-based. I think we said in our remarks every segment of the business grew organic sales at least 2% or more.Jon MoellerI would just add one thing and then I will answer the next part of your question. If you look at everything that Bob just said is spot on. If you look at versus expectation what part of the business is exceeding the most, encouragingly that\u2019s North America. And the reason that\u2019s encouraging is one that\u2019s one of our strategic priorities. And second, it\u2019s our most profitable business. So, we are very encouraged by that. To the question of developing market growth rates for P&G and what we should expect going forward, we are still expecting 8% or higher growth, so an acceleration of growth in the back half for the full fiscal year. Part of the 40\/20\/10 plans as Bob mentioned, January is the first month when those are all fully in market. And those have a big developing market component as well. So, our plans will be strengthening in the back half in developing markets and we expect to accelerate the rate of sales growth even beyond what we have done so far.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please proceed.Lauren Lieberman - BarclaysThanks. Good morning.Bob McDonaldHi, Lauren.Lauren Lieberman - BarclaysHey, so just following up on that actually, I was hoping you guys could comment a little bit on China, because I know last quarter sort of was a little bit of a surprise to me as that business had slowed and there has been no mention of China at all in the call so far. So, can you just give us an update I know there was a lot, was sort of not supposed to accelerate to the second half, but I just love an update on progress there? Thanks.Jon MoellerSure. Thanks Lauren. Well, China organic sales grew high-single digits in the quarter and grew double-digits last fiscal year. Share is still down a little bit versus last year but about half of the business is holding or growing shares of about 50%. And share trends are improving on more than two-thirds of a portfolio that we have in China. We have got a strong portfolio of innovation launching this fiscal year and particularly here in the back half of the year and we expect the combination of our interventions that we have already made and our innovation will return us to market share growth in China.Bob McDonaldBy the way, Lauren, it\u2019s nice to hear your, so I am glad to have you back.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan. Please proceed.John Faucher - JPMorganYeah, thank you. Good morning. As we look at the market share performance, we have obviously seen a ramp-up in U.S. performance maybe not gaining share per se, but definitely losing a lot less share. Europe seems to be the big outlier there, where it doesn\u2019t look like your share performance has improved all that much. Can you talk about what\u2019s different about that market from a share perspective I know it\u2019s growing more slowly? Are there pricing adjustments you need? Is that an innovation question? So, just a little bit of color on the European market shares. Thanks.Bob McDonaldAs you know John, the market in Europe economically is challenged and we believe that we will strengthen our share position in Europe over the next few months. Remember, Jon talked about introducing PODS on Ariel, which is the largest and leading laundry detergent in most of Europe in the April through June quarter. And we think the innovations like that will help. We also have introduced Oral Care in Europe in this semester. And so far all markets are trending above expectation. So, new innovations like that will help us regain share growth in Europe. Jon?Jon MoellerThere are a couple of categories where we do need to adjust prices and will be adjusting prices, but it\u2019s not significant. If you step back, we took $3.6 billion of pricing last year. We told you in the last call that we have made choices to roll back about $400 million of that. That figure is now about $500 million including the changes that we are making in Europe.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of UBS. Please proceed.Nik Modi - UBSJust wanted to follow up on the geographic question. If you can provide any perspective on how the U.S. actually performed volume-wise? Just to give us a little perspective on that market. And just the bigger picture question is, (inaudible) obviously was announced to take over the -- kind of overseeing the productivity and organizational redesign. Just curious where we are in the process and when we can expect to get an update.Bob McDonaldYeah, let me take the second question first, if I may, Nik. (Inaudible) and his team are hard at work. We have identified over 30 new discontinuous innovations that we can bring to market. We have vetted those throughout the company. We are in the midst of consumer research. And we are excited about them. We took all of our leadership through them recently. And we fully expect to be in market with the beginning of that, the fruits of that labor within the next year or so.Jon MoellerAnd on the North American volume question. Well, we typically don\u2019t provide numbers by region. What I will tell you is that the North American volume results in terms of growth were higher than the company average. So there is a strong underpinning of volume component in the North American numbers.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.Bill Schmitz - Deutsche BankI am trying to introduce in a two-part question, connected obviously. So you said the operating margin leverage on 5% top line growth was 50 to 75 basis points. I was wondering if that still kind of holds. And then secondly, if you look at the growth algorithm, it seems like your weighted category growth is 3% to 4%. And if my math is right, it seems like to add one incremental point of top line growth, it\u2019s only about 10 basis points of global market share, assuming your global market is $800 billion. So I just want to know if that\u2019s correct or not. Thanks.Jon MoellerBoth of those are ballpark correct.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson HumphreyJust wanted to look at the two numbers that you throw out and just try to get some color in terms of gaining close to 50% of your categories gaining share worldwide and then 60% in the U.S. Is there a number that you are looking for? Obviously 100% would be ideal but where you come away and say, boy, this is what we are really aiming for and so then we can kind of put in perspective.Bob McDonaldYeah, we think about 65% is really what we would like to do.Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson HumphreyFor both the U.S. and international.Bob McDonaldFor every market in the world. Sure.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Please proceed.Ali Dibadj - BernsteinSo you guys had mentioned a couple of times kind of the organizational structural work that I think Jorge is doing. Which sounds encouraging but can you help define how that\u2019s different than the work Marc Pritchard did I guess about five years ago or Kirk Perry did a few years ago. Because I have been on the phone -- you guys really know what the answer about the old structure will be, is kind of Marc and Kirk I think came up with, which is something around, look there are too many cooks in the kitchen. Between the GBU, the MDO, the functions now and maybe even at the GLC level. So given that premise, what really you have, will he have to actually execute some of the potential recommendations. So layer reductions I am thinking of in some of those structures, can it happen quickly. Both for your cost, but I think importantly, and this is my point of view for its worth, importantly also for quickening decision making in the company. And when can we hear more about this organization structure you, again, because I think it\u2019s key to your sustainable improvement here.Bob McDonaldJust to clear up the confusion that I may have caused or may have been caused. Jorge Mesquita is leading our discontinuous innovation program. Jorge Uribe is leading our productivity and productivity and organization transformation program. What's different this time is that Jorge has a team of top leaders working with him. I am involved. In fact we had meetings this week and I was involved with the team this week. And our Global Human Resource Officer is leading as well as the functional leaders are involved as well. And of course, Jorge reports to me. So, this is why we will make big decisions, we will do things quickly, and we will find ways to improve the effectiveness of organization.OperatorYour next question comes from the line Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer. Please proceed.Joe Altobello - OppenheimerThanks. Good morning. I just had a quick question on the profit growth across these segments, if you look at your organic sales growth, it\u2019s been pretty remarkably consistent across the segments, but the profit growth has been somewhat more uneven, and I am looking at grooming and healthcare in particular. Is that due to the timing of some cost-saving initiatives or innovation or is it something more structural in those two segments that might cause those profit growth to obviously lag the rest of the business? Thanks.Bob McDonaldOn a grooming, you recall that we have made as part of some of the big interventions we made last spring. We had a pretty significant pricing and promotion adjustment on that business and that\u2019s one of the reasons that on a year-to-year basis that index is a little bit lower. But we would not expect that to be an ongoing dynamic and obviously the overall structural attractiveness from a margin standpoint of that business is very high. And the healthcare dynamic is really a function of a couple of supply-related issues that we have been working through successfully, but we had to incur some additional costs to manage those effectively.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital MarketsGood morning. I think it\u2019s encouraging that the PODS are going into Europe, it suggest that you have came up with the solution to the capacity constraints in the U.S. So, could you comment on that and give us an indication of when you think U.S. sales and merchandising can pick up on PODS in the U.S. because they have been flat for the last few months? Thanks.Bob McDonaldWell, we have been merchandising PODS, Connie, in the U.S., but we have merchandising the bags that hold the PODS, not the tubs. And we have got additional capacity in the U.S. that will ramp up this semester and the new capacity that we have put in Europe is the ideal line. In other words, the first line we used was not ideal. We have improved that line and that\u2019s the capacity we are putting in. So, you will quickly see unlimited capacity in the semester, you will see relatively unlimited capacity in the U.S. as well as incremental capacity in Europe. And obviously as we have said this is right now on one brand and one country and we plan to expand that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge ResearchHi, good morning everyone. And thank you for taking the question. The question comes back again to the U.S., I think that you mentioned that it was ahead of company average, so ahead of 2%. And if we look at retail sales at least in tracked channels, we get declines of 2%. So, if you can explain whether this is a channel issue the fact that we don\u2019t get club data that can explain the gap of over 4 points of growth in volumes or whether the increased merchandise activity ahead of the product launches in the third quarter in Beauty contributed to the strong growth in North America. If you can quantify that, that will be very helpful. Thank you.Jon MoellerYeah, I am not sure I can square the full equation, because I haven\u2019t spend a lot of time on that, but the sell-in behind our Beauty initiatives and some of our other initiatives did have a positive volume impact in the second quarter in North America, but even with that impact stripped out, I would stay with the statement that North American results on a normalized basis from a volume standpoint were better than the company average. So, pretty strong underlying and I really can\u2019t reconcile that to the other data, I apologize, but we\u2019ll work with you on that.The very encouraging thing is that while there was some pipeline volume which was obviously part of our forecast in the second quarter, the January business is very strong. We have seen no dip at all. In fact, we have seen acceleration. And so we are pretty comfortable that the volume trends we have seen in the U.S. are sustainable.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.Jason Gere - RBC Capital MarketsI guess I will just continue on the last question on the U.S. Maybe if you can just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape and your thoughts maybe over the next six months. Just a more benign cost environment, it just seems top line is a little bit harder to come by. And I know you have the strength of innovation. But I was just wondering what you are seeing from your peers.Bob McDonaldWe are seeing the normal level of promotion support, perhaps with the exception of the hair care category which is probably one of the most active given the number of new entries that have occurred over the last couple of years. But as you rightly pointed out, Jason, I think the antidote or the method of growth here is behind innovation. And we have our particularly strong innovation program. As you know Vidal Sassoon Pro series. Jon talked about Pantene Expert adding over 6000 -- like adding over 6000 hairs to your head. I know I can certainly use that. Our oral care business continues to grow, Tide PODS. So again innovation is key and we plan to continue that.Jon MoellerAs we have talked before, consumer remain very receptive to real innovation and are willing to pay for it. And importantly, retailers are hungry for real innovation that grows categories and grows market basket. So we have had very strong receptivity on the part of our retail partners to the innovation program.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.Joe Lachky - Wells FargoI just wanted to focus specifically on the beauty and grooming segments where you showed positive organic sales but flat volume. And specifically on the volume, I guess you did mention you had a little bit of sell-in the beauty that gave you a positive impact in that segment. Maybe if you could quantify that. And then how do you turn around volume in grooming. I know you got some innovation, both in beauty and in grooming. But maybe if you could describe how you accelerate volume in those two segments.Bob McDonaldWell, our beauty business has grown organic sales 11 out of last 12 quarters, averaging roughly 3% growth over the past three years. In our grooming business, 11 out of 12 quarters, averaging 4% growth over the last three years. In hair care as I said we are expanding the portfolio vertically with innovations like Vidal Sassoon Pro series in the salon affordable segment. And the Pantene Expert series in the super premium space. And then as Jon pointed out, we have got Wella ILLUMINA and COLOR RECHARGE in the professional space.In skin care we are investing to ensure sufficiency our core Olay business and we are bringing new innovation that addresses key segments where we currently have portfolio gaps and it\u2019s critical to fill those portfolio gaps. Examples include, in the United States, New Olay micro-sculpting cream. Total Effects CC cream which stands for color correction, and Olay Fresh Effects. In China we have got Olay Natural Pro-X Whitening. The launch of a new mid-tier brand in the coming months.In blades and razors, the interventions we talked about last fiscal year are working. The share is up nearly 2 points to 74% and we are launching a bundle of new innovations across Fusion, MACH 3 disposables, and shave preps that are focused on sensitive skin. And every man we have talked to about shaving, talked to about sensitive skin. And last but not least, Jon talked about cosmetics and the two exciting COVERGIRL innovations this quarter, Clump Crusher by LashBlast; and Outlast Stay Brilliant Nail Gloss. And the initial results of all of these are at or above our expectation.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research. Please proceed.Alice Longley - Buckingham ResearchMy questions are follow-up questions. I don\u2019t think that you gave us how fast you think your markets grew globally and then in the three geographic regions, U.S. Europe and emerging regions. And then on the U.S. alone, do you -- according to your numbers, did you overall hold gain or lose share? Thank you.Jon MoellerSure. From a market growth standpoint, averagely about 4%, a little over 4%, and that breaks down to about high-singles in developing markets obviously relatively low-singles in developed markets. And on the share question on the U.S., Bob you want to handle that?Bob McDonaldAs we said, we are growing or holding share in the 60% of our business in the U.S. If you look at the overall U.S. number, it\u2019s down a little bit, but the trend is getting better. And as you would expect with these new innovations that started shipping at the end of December and with the strength that Jon talked about, we are seeing in early January, we would expect those share trends to improve.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.Mark Astrachan - Stifel NicolausYeah, thanks. Good morning everybody. Back on Beauty, it still seems like you are losing share there in spite of the innovation. I guess going forward how do you think about balancing innovation with acquisitions new brands to improve the share trends? And then what do you think is the reasonable go-forward expectation for your volume growth in that category?Bob McDonaldYeah, Mark I don\u2019t think, I think there is a timing sequence difference here. I don\u2019t think we are losing share despite the innovations. In fact in the places where we are innovating and introducing new innovations are for example in the Western Europe, Latin America, where we have introduced Oral Care, where we are gaining share. The innovations that we have talked about particularly those in this call are really those they have shipped in December are strengthening the business in January, but you will really see the impact more in the balance of the fiscal year. And certainly that\u2019s true with something like Vidal Sassoon Pro Series or Pantene Expert, which only started shipping a couple of weeks ago. And our expectations for our Beauty and grooming business on a long-term basis are no different than the balance of our business. We are targeting and want to be able to grow our sales one to two points ahead of the market growth rate.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Steib of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.Michael Steib - Credit SuisseGood morning. Jon you spoke earlier about getting the balance between savings and growth rates as the business is so leveraged to growth more so than most of your peers. My question is are you investing enough, is the company investing enough to really drive that top-line growth, because even at the high end of your new organic sales growth guidance basically just implies growth in line with the past few years and still somewhat below some of your global peers?Jon MoellerThat\u2019s a very good question. Thank you for that question. Our objective remains to grow our sales ahead of the market. And so you are absolutely right that while we are accelerating, we are still on the journey and we do intend to get to growth rates that are above the market level. We are investing significantly to do that as I said in my remarks. Bob has said we spend a lot of time working on strengthening plans for the second half of the year with an eye towards doing exactly that plus strengthening next fiscal year. And we will be making, we were already making significant investments in the back half and those will be strengthened based on the over-delivery in the second quarter. So, we are pretty confident that results will continue to accelerate and hopefully we will get to where you rightly think we should be sooner rather than later.Bob McDonaldAnd at the same time, our productivity program will continue to accelerate as well. So, there would be even more potential for investment.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser of B. Riley Caris. Please proceed.Linda Bolton Weiser - B. Riley CarisHi. I was wondering if you could more specifically quantify these cost savings a basis point positive effect on both gross margin and SG&A. And also the commodities comparison, I would assume it was flattish year-over-year or maybe even down. And is it right to assume that the commodity comparison will get even better in the next two quarters? And then on the Fabric and Home Care, did the Hurricane Sandy positive effect, how much was that on the whole category growth was it for the segment, was it up 0.5 point or 1 point or less than that? Thanks.Jon MoellerSo, first of all, you are absolutely right, commodity impacts were essentially neutral on the quarter, that\u2019s about what we are expecting on a go-forward basis. There are some that are moving up a little bit. There are some that are moving down a little bit, but in broad terms, it\u2019s fairly neutral. In terms of the cost savings components within gross and operating margin, there are about 100 basis points of savings that positively impacted gross margin and about 60 basis points of savings that positively impacted the SG&A line. So that in total, there were about 160 basis points of productivity savings in the quarter. That compares to about 150 basis points in the last quarter. So, you are seeing some as you would expect increasing contribution from productivity. Frankly, it will be very hard for us to tease out the Sandy impact on any of our individual businesses. We worked hard to manage inventories and supply in a way that minimized the impact to consumers. So, I would for all practical purposes consider that a non-impact.Bob McDonaldOne of the things we did do with our Tide brand is our Tide Loads of Hope truck, which has washing machines on, it was up and down the East Coast washing the clothes of people who lost their homes and introducing people who had never seen the Tide or never used the Tide brand before to Tide, so a good trial effort, but also doing some good things at the same time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst of Wellington Shields. Please proceed.Leigh Ferst - Wellington ShieldsGood morning. Could you tell us how you evaluate your decision to shift more to local manufacturing in the emerging markets, you said it benefits the supply chain, could you talk about how that \u2013 could you talk about other issues that going through your decision and how you evaluate that differently now versus maybe 5 or 10 years ago? And finally, is there a halo effect on consumption if you are creating more employment in this local manufacturing?Bob McDonaldYou\u2019ve hit on some of the criteria for that decision. Obviously, you want to establish a business that\u2019s big enough to create a rate of return for the capacity, but you also want to look at some key criteria location, government support, the quality of the workforce, these are the risk-adjusted rate of capital. These are all things that we look at. Relative to the change, it\u2019s very interesting. Two things, one when I joined the Procter & Gamble company in 1980, manufacturing expense was a big element that we worried a lot about and logistics cost was a very small element, because the price of diesel was very low. Today, manufacturing expense is relatively low, because there are very few people in our manufacturing plants. Jon talked about our ability to build 20 new plants, but not add any enrollment or headcount to the company, because of 6.5% improving productivity in manufacturing roles.But the logistics cost has skyrocketed. And as a result of that, we worked very hard to distribute our plants globally. We have roughly 150 plants around the world. They have to be near the consumers they serve. We export very little and we have a competitive advantage, because we create scale by having all of our global business units around one plant. So, when we buy land, we buy land for all the business in the company planning to take advantage of that scale. That scale then helps us in filling logistics orders, because our trucks don\u2019t weigh out with something like Gillette blades and they don\u2019t cube out with something like Pampers disposable diapers. We are able to get the optimum balance of weight and cube which gives us the competitive advantage on costs. So, we have done relatively well on the logistics cost year-to-year despite the increase in diesel.OperatorYour final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Please proceed.Caroline Levy - CLSAGood morning. Having just got back from China actually I just would like to ask you to dive a little deeper into the various segments, I think six major segments you have there. And what the competitive challenges have been is it more from local manufacturers or international competition by your key segments?Bob McDonaldThat would be a really long answer. Maybe, Caroline we can take that offline, because that\u2019s a really long discussion. But as you would imagine in some categories it\u2019s the local competitor, in some categories it\u2019s the global competitor. There is not an easy answer. We are the largest consumer goods company in China by a large factor. We do have an outstanding distribution network. And our expectation as Jon has said is to grow 1 to 2 points above the market.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17429":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call October 20, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Sumeet Vohra - Chief Marketing Office Asia","Matthew Price - President of China Selling and Market Operations","Jasmine Xu - The Procter & Gamble Company China","Analysts","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research","Caroline Levy - Macquarie","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Thanks for coming this morning, actually this evening our time from P&G's officers in Guangzhou, China. China as you know is P&G's second largest market both in terms of sales and profit. Given as importance I am in the market two or three times each year and this time we just thought we take advantage of the resources here to give you deeper perspective and its important business and the progress we are making.","China and Guangzhou are special places for me. My wife Lisa and I lived and worked here in the 90s. We hired and developed mush of the finance talent that helps lead P&G's China business today. It's always very good to be back.","I am joined here this morning by Sumeet Vohra, the End-to-End Category General Manager for China Hair Care. I am also joined by Matthew Price, President of China Selling and Market Operations. Matthew reports today the Taylor, our CEO. And we are joined by Jasmine Xu, who works with the end-to-end categories in China on building on omnichannel ecommerce capability. With double eleven right around the corner here in China, I am sure Jasmine will have some interesting perspective to share.","Let me turn first though to the company's results for the July-September quarter. As we said on our last earnings call, this quarter presented our most difficult top line comparison of the year. Underlying market growth was notably stronger in the base period than it is now. As you have no doubt heard from others, market growth continues to be sluggish. We estimate global category below 2.5% for the quarter, a modest deceleration versus the April-June period. P&G organic sales grew 1% on 1% volume growth fully in line with our internal estimates going into the quarter.","These results include about a 30 basis point impacts from the earthquake in Mexico and hurricanes in Texas to Gulf Coast and Puerto Rico each of which causes the halt operations in these geographies during the quarter. They also include a 40 basis point impact from the combination of U.S. pricing investments and discontinued brands of product forms. All of these impacts will dissipate as the year progresses.","Market share trends continue to improve with 13 of the top 20 countries and 14 of the top 20 brands, 65% of top 20 counties, 70% of top 20 brands growing or holding share. Ecommerce growth continues to be very strong, up 40% with seven out of ten categories growing share and two others holding share. 90% of categories growing or holding ecommerce share. On the bottom line, all earnings per share were $1.06, up 10% versus the prior year. Core earnings per share were $1.09, up 6%. This includes the $0.03 headwind from higher commodity costs and a penny from the natural disasters I mentioned earlier. These impacts, negative mix and increase investments more than offset triple digit productivity savings contributing to a modest core operating profit decline of 40 basis points versus year ago.","The core effective tax rate was 23.4% about a half point above last year. Free cash flow productivity was 87%, we repurchased $1.5 billion in shares and distributed $1.8 billion in dividends this quarter and totaled $4.3 billion of value return to shareholders.","Net results that were in line with our going and expectations, despite some unanticipated negative impacts and slowing market growth continued going to increase the number of brands of markets that are holding and growing share both offline and online continuing to deliver productivity savings with strong cash flow.","As a result, we are maintaining fiscal year guidance across all elements top line, bottom line and cash. We expect organic sales growth of 2% to 3%, despite the continued deceleration of market growth rates. This estimate includes about a quarter of a point of headwind from portfolio cleanup in the ongoing business. It also includes the headwind from the price adjustment on the U.S. blades and razors business made late last fiscal year. Again both of these headwinds with have their biggest impact in the first half of the year and will annualize as the year progresses.","We expect fiscal 2018 all in sales growth of around 3%. This includes a zero to half point net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of the India goods and services tax implementation. Our bottom line guidance as for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. We expect core operating profit growth to be the primary driver of core earnings per share growth this fiscal year. We expect to combine the impact of interest expense, interest income and other non-operating income to the net headwind on fiscal 2018 core earnings per share growth. The core effective tax rates should be around 24%, roughly in line with fiscal 2017. Share count will be an EPS benefit of about 2 percentage points due to discreet share repurchase and the carryover benefit from the beauty transaction share exchange that benefited July-September results but is now fully in the base period comparisons going forward.","We planned to deliver another year of 90% or better free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. We'll continue our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay nearly $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchased $4 billion to $7 billion of our shares in fiscal 2018.","At current rates and prices, FX has held of about $150 million after tax versus a year ago. Following the natural disasters we're now estimating about a $300 million profit hit from higher commodity costs. We knew we'd see higher pulp cost going into year, these costs have continue to increase beyond initial forecast ranges. Ethylene, propylene, kerosene, and the polyethylene and polypropylene resins have increased recently primarily as a result of the hurricanes in the Gulf. Significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar further commodity cost increases our addition geopolitical are not anticipated within this guidance range.","Turning now to China. We're making significant progress in this very important market. In fiscal 2016, two years ago, organic sales declined 5%. Last fiscal year, we grew 1%. We're projecting mid-single-digit growth this year. And the quarter we just completed, China organic sales grew 8%. Including about 2 points of pre-shipments for Double 11 day. So far, October is trending fully in line with expectations, so we have a very good start toward our mid-single-digit objective for the fiscal year.","Two year ago, again in fiscal 2016, two of seven product categories grew organic sales in China. Last fiscal year, we grew sales in five of seven categories, this quarter we grew in six of seven and we expect organic sales growth in all seven categories over the course of the fiscal year. Of the ten sub-categories in which we compete in China, 4 grew share offline and 7 grew share online over the last three month period, up from 2 and 5 respectively over the last 12 months.","A few highlights, SK-II organic sales grew more than 40% this quarter, driven by the successful digital campaign, hashtag I never expire and the additional new users in department stores and online. Olay organic sales were up mid-teens driven by the launch of the premium Olay self-science boutique in September and strong growth or ecommerce and counter businesses.","Hair Care has made sequential market share progress over the past few quarters, driven by new premium, innovation on Head & Shoulders, Pantene and Rejoice. Sumeet will share more detail on these innovations in just a few minutes.","Family Care organic sales grew mid-teens, driven by continued growth of premium innovations like Whisper Infinity and Radiant our best preforming thin pads. Whisper Pink, our mid-tier cotton like top sheets innovation and the launch of Whisper pure cotton our new premium pad with a 100% natural cotton top sheet. Oral Care grew 7%. Pampers launched its new premium tier taped diaper, Pampers ichiban in August along with the re-launch of the premium pant style diaper. Both are produced in Japan and imported into China.","Pampers ichiban is already available in more than 10,000 baby stores and nearly 4,800 hyper and super stores. Consumer awareness continues to build, consumer comments and product radians are very good and consumer conversion from competitive premium tiers is strong. In August, Pampers grew share in the premium segment for the first time in many years.","We're also making significant progress in the overall pant segment. This is the fastest growing form in the market growing at a 40% clip. Pampers is now the market leader in the platform in China, up from number 5 just two years ago. Pampers pant sales in July-September grew 200% versus the prior year. China Pampers overall sales and share for the quarter were much improved versus prior quarters, but we're still below year-ago levels in total due to soft shipments and mid-tier tape diapers which account for about 75% of base period shipments as wholesale inventories were drawn down ahead of new innovation and pack size shipments and as we work through and innovation related price increase.","We expect to grow China Baby Care sales this fiscal year and return Pampers to share growth which would mark a significant turnaround.","We continue to build share in ecommerce in China. We grew ecommerce sales approximately 60% this quarter and a market growing around 50% with 7 out of 10 categories and sub-categories holding our growing online market share. Accelerating growth in China is important to both the top and bottom lines of our company. After tax profit margins in China remain very strong, despite significant investments over the last few years and product and package innovations, additional sales resources and targeted value corrections. So second largest profit contributor after the U.S. with one of our highest after tax margin, so growth here matters.","I know want to turn to Matthew, Sumeet and Jasmine to give you a deeper view into the progress we're making in China. Sumeet, our largest China businesses Hair Care which you run, can you start by just giving us an overview of the Hair Care market in China and P&G's position in it.","Sumeet Vohra","Thank you, Jon. I am going to focus my remarks on the mainland China. China is the biggest Hair Care market in the world with retail sales of $8 billion. P&G is the market leader in China by a distance. We're nearly three times as big as the number two player and four of the top five hair care brands are from P&G.","The Hair Care market is growing mid-single-digits. P&G's portfolio of brands, strong brand equities, our technologies, favorable cost structure and innovation program puts us in a strong position to create value in China Hair Care.","Jon Moeller","You know Sumeet have been - to me a couple of important organization changes in Hair Care in China. One of course is going end-to-end. Another is having sufficient resources on the ground in China. And the third is probably the priority the global category has placed on the China Hair Care business. Do you agree with that observation and how do you see those changes making a difference?","Sumeet Vohra","Yeah, I agree with that observation. These organization changes and the priority from the global category have made a big difference to our business. Category dedication is helping Hair Care expertise in our sales teams and partner more effectively with our retail partners. With sufficient resources in China, decisions are being made closer to the ground and hence the quality of decisions and speed has improved.","One example of speed, we finalize the packaging design for Rejoice Micro-Silicone water in mid-December and we shift in May that is within 18 weeks. These intervention are helping us deliver sequential improvement in Hair Care sales and market share.","Jon Moeller","So tell us about innovation in Hair Care and why it matters?","Sumeet Vohra","Innovation in Hair Care is key to delighting consumers, keeping our brands relevant and growing the category. As you know, our recent premium price innovation such as Rejoice Water, Pantene Three Minute Miracle, Pantene Hair Energy Water and Head & Shoulders Supreme are great examples of this. These are very good products and consumers and customers are happy with them.","We are also innovating and marketing in media. Our recent break the rules program on Vera Sweeney [ph] has helped us grow very nicely. Our innovation program together with the go-to-market interventions has helped grow China Hair Care business 2% in fiscal 2017 and 5% the quarter just concluded. Our market share trends are improving and we grew offline retail share in the last reported period.","Jon Moeller","And very importantly, how do you feel about the future of Hair Care in China?","Sumeet Vohra","We have a strong portfolio brands that take us to the most important needs in the category. We are bringing it in the simple products, packages and innovations to the market. We have now gone end-to-end and have sufficient resources on the ground were empower to make decisions. We have significantly increased speak to market and are now working to bring innovations from idea to market in less than six months. And we have attractive market structure.","These intervention set us up as a thought leader in the industry and in a very strong position in China Hair Care.","Jon Moeller","And Matthew, where do you think we are in the overall China turnaround, what are the opportunities and challenges that lay ahead of us?","Matthew Price","Thank you, Jon. To execute the turnaround, we needed to bring more premium innovation and better cover the growing channels. All of the categories have built premium innovation in the last six months. Also we are strengthening our coverage of key channels including dedicated coverage of baby and cosmetic stores. Hence I am pleased report, we grew sales 8% this quarter which puts us on track to deliver mid-single digit for the fiscal year. This is in line with market growth.","You asked me about key challenges. I think one is to deal with what we call here moving China speed. We believe with the end-to-end organization decision making with a GBUs having more decision making on the ground and they are scaled organization will increasingly well set up to achieve this.","Jon Moeller","And as President of the Selling and Market Operations Organization here in China, what are your priorities?","Matthew Price","My policy is to amplify the innovation and brand plans that the GBUs developed and enable them to benefit from our scale. I'd like to give you some examples. Innovation, as you know China has very distinct channels such as ecommerce, cosmetics stores, hyper stores, baby stores and multiple small store formats. The SMO make sure that the plan are tailored by channel and can be executed with excellence.","Media is one of the largest advertisers in China, therefore it makes perfect sense to use our corporate scale to create winning partnerships with all media companies. Sumeet has plans that have mass market TV bias and other brands that require much more targeting and are more digital. The SMO ensures he gets the best deal but the performance can be measured and we provide a menu of media options.","Customer Support. At buyer level, as we've already discussed, we have category focused through the end-to-end dealing with the buy direct. But customers and us want joint business plans and strategic partnerships at corporate level that build value for both sides. The SMO leads us.","Distributor management, a very large part of our business goes through distributors to small stores. Our scale enables us to have industry leading distribution. We ensure our programs of appropriate and sequence to enable each brand to maximize in-store presence and trial. It also enables us to have industry beating receivables.","Logistics, China is big, we have over 1,000 ship to locations. To deliver industry leading logistics costs and customer service, we deliver on a multi category basis which is what our customers want. Our logistics operation is a cost to be used scale play again run by the SMO.","Government Relations, it's critical in China maintaining and building national and provincial government relations to ensure strong support the GBUs to pursue their business. Organization, building a winning organization to the GBUs and SMO have a strong talent supply, again led by the SMO.","Lastly, digital. We're building corporate digital capabilities that are critical for the GBUs to develop consumer, shopper and business insides. So the data is managed by the SMO, because this is clearly a scale play. These are just some examples of how the SMO and GBU end-to-end model work. So we're pleased to see the results coming through with 8% growth this quarter.","Jon Moeller","And just picking up on your comment on digital, maybe you can give us a few examples?","Matthew Price","So we are developing suppliers who gather install data digitally to provide insight for ourselves, people and track our progress but also having digitized media tracking so we can measure reach across platforms and multiple devices. We work with key digital player such as Tencent, Bitauto Weibo , Alibaba, Jingdong and the omnichannels.","We are building big data analytics that enabled targeted and measurable marketing. We are using digital tools to increase insurance and complaints. All of this leads to better consumer insights but shopper insights and better business understanding to the business units.","Jon Moeller","And Jasmine maybe you can share with us what your role is how it's supports the category organizations?","Jasmine Xu","Thank you, John. I lead the Chinese e-com company business which is the fastest growing channel with more than $1 billion itself. Our team has two missions, grow online penetration for each category. We have marketing and sales team dedicated for each category who report to the regional business units. At the same time, we create skilled capability as competitive advantage such as big data, ecommerce supply chain and media targeting capability. These scale capabilities actually enable each of the category to grow their brands.","Jon Moeller","And what are the biggest challenges and opportunities you see in ecommerce and how are we addressing them?","Jasmine Xu","I will summarize e-com challenges in two ways, one is speed of change, innovations and changes happen at a faster pace online. The second one is really trading up, 45% of the China e-com market in our relevant categories are already in premium tiers. This challenges actually are equally opportunity for P&G. We've focused on a few things. Operating our marketing model to be more digitally driven and socially focused. We walk with e-com player to leverage big data to reach the relevant shopper where they are ready to buy. We also fully leverage the drop of order to win. More than half of our online business is premium tiers and new forms.","Our fastest growing brands, our premium brands such as SK-II, power toothbrushes with infinity. We build a strong team. The local e-com team have deep insights and with the end-to-end structure that enables faster decision making. Our skilled capability creates a match competitive advantage. Co-instance we have medium problematic media capability, I know company do a lot of e-market app to make sure that we stay ahead.","Jon Moeller","Sure, everybody wants to know how are we doing with millennial consumers online?","Jasmine Xu","First of all Jon, our team is full of passionate Chinese Millennials and in fact 80% of my team is Millennials. From shopper standpoint, the average profile of P&G online shopper is 28 year old female, living in one of the top cities in China. Over the last two years, our online shopper profile has got younger. To delight Millennials, we're doing more authentic storytelling instead of traditional advertising. We understand Millennials prefer a more personalized experience.","For examples consumers combine all of the power brush which come with their names and horoscope printed on the handle. We launch technology innovations such as virtual reality and automotive reality to invite consumer to interact with their favorite brand ambassadors.","Jon Moeller","Very importantly, are we prepared for Double 11 day?","Jasmine Xu","Yeah, we very much look forward to another successful Double 11. We were leverage dispute window to create trial on our latest and best innovations. We work with customers to accelerate kind of a growth. Our logistic network supply chain and online consultant teams are fully ready to buy provide consumers a delightful Double 11 experience and I'm also ready to buy a lot by myself.","Jon Moeller","Thank you each for your perspective. What I've experienced in the last three days working with you in China has a ton of energy, a passionate organization that is moving much more quickly and effectively to delight an increasingly premium and increasingly digital consumer at his or her speed enabled by an end-to-end category structure, working with an SMO that's building world class platforms and capabilities. I felt in the last week the same palpable excitement I felt back in 1996 when we were just embarking on this journey and my expectations are accordingly high.","Hopefully, this brief discussion has been insightful for investors. I'm going to wrap up and then we'll head to Q&A. Our results of the first quarter were in line with our expectations and keep us fully on track for the fiscal year. We continue to make progress, growing market share and more businesses and narrowing share gaps and many others. We're showing strong progress in China which as I've said is a very important market for P&G.","There are sure to be speed bumps and even a few hairpin turns ahead but our new operating approach end-to-end and freedom within a framework will enable us to be more agile as we navigate through these challenges. Productivity gains will provide fuel for investment and the ability to offset negative surprises just as we saw in the last quarter and grow margin as the year progresses.","Before we begin the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind you that the purpose of today's call is to provide perspective on the business. At this point, we have no further comments regarding the pending certification of the proxy contest results.","And with that, we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman","Great. Thanks. And I actually wanted to talk a little bit about Gillette in total and the grooming business as a bit weaker than we would expected, so I was hoping we could kind of dig in on two fronts, one is just what you are seeing in the U.S. market in terms of the result and responsiveness of the market. The price may had been a kind of impacting overall portfolio performance? And then results on guessing an immerging markets maybe a little bit better because there is just priced how negative mix level that you know that was geographical product? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Great. In terms of the U.S. innovation, it's generally working. As I think you know the first part of that is brought to market is pricing with product and communication to follow across the price tiers. In the - though the last six months, we have the highest volume shipment we've had in 11 years. And if we look at the most recent share period, past one month share was up 1.4 points in terms of volume which is the first share growth in two and half years. So again it's early, this is the business with a long purchase cycle and we're still bringing the balance of the program to market but generally that is operating as we expected it would.","The pricing reduction as you know is averaged about 12%, so the impact on total segment organic sales is not insignificant.","There was another big impact in the quarter and grooming which was the margin of Brazil. And there, there is we are going through a pricing cycle and we're experiencing the inventory dynamics that typically come with that cycle. If you take out North American and Brazil, you get the positive growth on the balance of the segment globally.","And I apologize Lauren, I think you asked another part of the question but maybe someone else remind me, I forgot that, but that's essentially how the growing business are shacking up.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good morning or good night I guess. So if I look at the divisional profit results ex-corporate expense, you were down 3.5% year-over-year in the quarter, get results can bounce around quarter-to-quarter but it's also down 3% on average in the last three quarters despite ad spend being down in that timeframe. So you know we've been hearing from you guys that the turnaround is progressing, why are we seeing more underlying profit progress and is the more difficult external environment in terms of slower category growth and an increase cost of doing business, is that more than offsetting any internal improvements and that change going forward?","Jon Moeller","So we're still expecting that the majority of EPS growth for the year is driven by operating and earnings growth as I said in the prepared remarks. And we are right, where we expected to be in terms of that progression. The quarter was a little bit more challenging, as I also indicated in the prepared remarks than we would have expected going in with the run up of commodity cost and the impact of the natural disasters. Things like very expensive fright laying and shipping laying in many of the impacted geographies.","Also as you know the productivity savings will build as we grow through the fiscal year and will also began annualizing the significant investment associated with the pricing reductions in July.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Hello guys. Thanks for the questions. So John question on industry growth that you are speaking to the 2.5% or actually sub 2.5% excuse me, I am just trying to reconcile that with some of the positive immerging markets commentary that were hearing from other CPG companies and you guys of course stand very good on China today and still are looking for mid-single growth. So can we get an update on where you are seeing slowing, presumably this is U.S. and other developed markets but maybe just comment specifically on what you are seeing from a growth rate in those regions and how that's potential change would be the first question.","And then number two, is there any large change in view with respect to where you think you come in on the 2% to 3% core sales for the year? Thank you for those.","Jon Moeller","Sure, Kevin. So in the quarter, if we just split developed and developing markets from a market standpoint, growth was about half a point in developed market and about 5 points in developing markets. So if you look at that sequentially, it's really an aggregate continued mid-singles digit level of growth in developing where the slowdown has been undeveloped and that is primarily the U.S.","And in terms of how that shapes our view the range of 2% to 3%, we as you know we're maintaining that range, I mean obviously the rate of market growth through the balance of the year will have an impact on where we end up within that range, but we're shooting as much as we can get.","Operator","And next we'll go to Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Hi Jon. Curious to hear how you view the current promotional environment in the U.S. right now? And then in looking at your activity, it does still appear to be pretty high versus historical levels but maybe that settled off on a year-over-year basis recently. So I guess on looking back, do you think the greater promotion you make over the last couple of years has really been successful or do you think it ultimately you know just resulted in taking dollars out of the categories?","And then as you think about your share figures you know which have stated to stabilize a bit after I guess what appears to be slight pull back on promos, do you think be more rationale has contributed to some slight share improvement in the last few months?","Jon Moeller","We probably see this slightly differently, let me just step back, I kind of walk you through how I see it. As you know, we'd rather spend a dollar on innovation or equity every day the week before we spend money on promotion. We need to be competitive on promotion, but it's not our desired, not high on our list of priorities in terms of spend. And the reason is very simple is because there is nothing proprietary and promotion whereas we can build proprietary advantage with those innovation and equity investments.","If you look at the quarter, price including - inclusive of promotion had no impact to top line growth, it was neutral. And if you over the - pricing has been neutral to positive for 28 consecutive quarters for 13 consecutive years again backing up my statement that's not typically the first card that we like to play. If I look at the U.S. P&G percentage of dollars sold on promotion was essentially flat, it was 101 index versus a year ago. It's obviously difference by category but again not indicative of a strategy that involves heavy promotion increases.","What is happening and what's very confusing is that retailers particularly in the U.S. are choosing to make investments in price as they compete with each other. And that shows up in the scanner data as a promotion but it's not one that's been funded by the manufacture and that case has been funded by the retailer. And with generally category leading brands and the strategy being to drive shoppers into store on the part of the retailer, our brands often disproportionately benefit in quotes from those kinds of investments. So long winded but generally I don't see a significant changes in promotion, going forward, we would rather spend money on innovation and equity building, but we do need to be and will be competitive in the promotion arena. I hope that helps and happy to talk more about it later.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good evening there. Good morning, everyone else. Could you elaborate on the bridge offset the commodities cost increase and particularly pulp and resin? And is it like you are expecting the product mix to get better because of the lap of the last or you are re-launching China? And also if I understood correctly, you mentioned that the new diaper conversion in China has been strong but can you please expand on the diaper re-launch in China and how is the initial performance has been?","Jon Moeller","Yeah, so we're generally answering one question here, so I am going to talk what I think is probably the most one which is diapers and turn that over to Matthew Price and ask him to provide some perspective.","Matthew Price","Okay. So we launched in August. We are going to share in the premium tier which we launched ichiban. And as Jon also mentioned, we grew pants share as well from being number five two years ago. So we - as I have to with the progress, we're also seeing that the ratings and reviews are relying with competition, we believe it is on track.","Jon Moeller","And from a commodity standpoint, I mentioned the increases versus are going to forecasts are primarily due to increases on Petra complex coming out of the Gulf as a result of the hurricanes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yeah, thanks and good afternoon, guys and good evening. My suggest SK-II is kind of for the large majority of growth in China in the quarter, I guess is that a fair characterization and then broadly looking at SK-II contribution overall Beauty segment sales assuming it was a contributing factor to the 4% mix growth. What does it imply about sort of the rest of the Beauty business in particular I think considering you lost share across most categories last year. So you what you have to do is starting seeing material improvement across the whole portfolio going forward? I guess how do you think about it and where is it going to start, where do you find the most difficulty so forth and so on? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Look, as we look at China, I wouldn't necessarily agree with the statement that SK-II drove all the growth that certainly was very growth fall at 40%. But as I mentioned earlier, Olay grew in the mid-teens, Feminine Care business grew in the mid-teens, Oral Care grew 7%, Hair Care as Sumeet mentioned grew 5%. So the breath of growth in China extends well beyond SK-II. As I mentioned six or seven categories grew sales in the quarter and we expect that to be seven of seven over the course of the fiscal year.","Beauty in general is doing very well. SK-II is part of that success but it's much broader than that. Beauty on a global basis delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of organic sales growth. We're seeing good growth in the Hair Care portion of the business as well as in the Skin and Personal Care side of the business that's actually a bright point for us at the moment.","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So over the past few weeks, you guys have been crisscrossing payment that globe meeting with investor sometimes with board members sometimes without. Given those discussions and there are plenty of them which is good and the kind of 0.3% lead you have so far and the proxy though. Can you give us a sense of some of key messages the management team and the board have taken away from all that, what were messages you actually heard from your institutional investors?","Jon Moeller","I will be happy to comment on the messages that I've heard. I obviously won't speak for others who aren't in the room. It's been a great opportunity to engage with investors both at the management level and the board level as you indicated. Clearly, what's been driven home to me is the passion that our investors have both large and small and that's a great asset and their interest in the company. And their ideas relative to, its success are also an incredible asset.","I received very strong support for the plan that we've embarked on with the clear desire to see it sooner. So clear the message to me is be even more deliberate, more quick and making the changes that we've been talking about. And certainly as I've been here in China this week, I see the team doing the same. And I would say the third thing is a desire that is broadly expressed to increase the connection between the investor base, the management team and the board and make sure that we are fully benefiting from perspective that they have.","So those are my three takeaways. Again I think that it's been a very useful and beneficial experience.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, guys. Thank you for squeeze me and I really appreciate it. Congratulations on some of the momentum in China, it's very encouraging to hear. I wanted to come back to your comments on the U.S. both in terms of deceleration, I was particularly intrigued by your comments of some degree of U.S. retail price of subsidization. So first, can you give us sort of your thoughts on what you think has driven the deceleration in the U.S.? Why do you think it's proved to be so persistent throughout the year? Any sort of indication you have of what's driving the underlying softness there?","And then secondly, the comment that retailers may be subsidizing some of the prices, is a little bit concerning because they don't seem to have a whole lot of margin flex to sustain that. How does this sustained, you are hearing comments from various other competitors talking about eroding price environment? Why shouldn't we think that this either translates down the road to a removal of subsidization therefore a volume impact you or a need for you to help fund some of that?","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Jason. In terms of let me just start with the market growth. And the simple answer isn't very fulfilling which is that I really - we've been unable to put our finger on why this has been. If we look at consumption for instance from our household panel data, there really is no change in consumption level across categories with one exception which is grooming which is driven by the style preference.","If we look at trade up or trade down within the market which also could have an impact on the dollar growth rate, we also see very little chance. Over the last three years, private label as one measure of this shares are essentially flat in the U.S., they are also essentially flat in Europe. There's been some uptick in the last quarter call it 30 basis points of share. It's concentrated in two categories though, it's not broad based; those two categories are tissue towel and grooming. In tissue towel, we're building share so that isn't impact in our business. We are familiar with the some of the private label launches in the grooming segment, but there's nothing there that really explains the broad category slowdown.","I've heard theories none of which I can really get comfortable with that attempt to explain the slowdown, one is that post the election the Hispanic consumer has withdrawn more from the market and is concerned about, is both concerned about their future and sending more money home and as a result is spending less. But as we look across the data that we can see across cities and geography is that have higher percent of Hispanic consumers there isn't a difference in market growth in those areas versus others.","The other theory that's been positive is that consumers are spending an increasing portion of their wallet on services. Healthcare, entertainment, data and mobile phone and therefore are spending less on stables, which doesn't make sense to me either because I mean I don't get it. I want a cell phones so I am not going to wash my hair, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.","So unfortunately, as I said my answer would be somewhat frustrating there, we're still searching. In terms of the retail dynamic, it's not across all categories, it's in a few categories, there is probably most pronounced in the baby care category because of the value of that shopper, the perceived value of that shopper to either Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target, Costco you name it.","And what we're trying to do to prevent the outcome that you describe is to help retailers with differentiated offerings for their shoppers, so that there's less direct comparison in that therefore less need to compete on that basis. But this is obviously something that is a challenge and does affect the market numbers as I said earlier. But we're making good progress and avoiding the negative impacts of that as I mentioned price continues to be neutral as a contributor to top line.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning, thanks very much. I really enjoyed the presentation on China and I should say good evening. Good morning for everyone else. I wanted to ask you about from the presentation first, how does your premium share of focusing in China on ecommerce compare with offline? Is that made is that different presumably higher because more because of ecommerce capabilities you have or more because of the kind of people who are shopping online, if there is just something to more premium shopper likely to do that. And what learnings are there in planning which why can't that model be exported readily to North America in other developed markets where presumably there's a lot of premium shopping going on and a ton of opportunity to grab that high-end consumer where not just Procter but other CPG companies are just getting a lot smaller share of the pie over the past decade? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Maybe I will ask Jasmine to comment on that across categories within China and then ask some Sumeet to comment on that from what he sees from his Hair Care perspectives. Jasmine?","Jasmine Xu","Sure, for Chinese e-com business we actually have more than 60% of the business in a premium tiers and new forms is driven by few factors, the first one is we certainly amplify already pretty innovations brought by the categories and to support our innovations, we also try to adopt a new business model which is much more digital focused. And also leverage the social comment to what amount to make sure that would drive authentic storytelling among the premium users.","We also use big data to make sure that we understand the shopper inside out and target them at the time that where when they are willing to buy our products. So end-to-end from product innovation or the way about how we drive marketing as social with excellent online was what one of the key drivers why our premium business portion is much bigger online compared to other places maybe.","Sumeet Vohra","And from Hair Care line what I'm seeing is that the consumer is really attracted to a lot of the premium proposition in Hair Care and they're also buying the bucket size is bigger than they tend to buy more items like shampoos, conditioners and treatments. And what we're saying is that they're also really responsive to the innovation that we are bringing. So combination of the hunger for the consumer to shop for multiple items and the innovation that we're bringing is really helping us build business e-com space in China.","Jonathan Feeney","And what do you see in terms of difference between e-com and offline in terms of the percentage of businesses premium?","Sumeet Vohra","So in terms of the percentage of business that is premium e-com tends to be significantly higher. So in fact some of the new premium brands that we have launched or the proposition that we've launched, they tend to sell a lot more on e-com and consumers tend to drive them a lot faster than we see in offline.","Jon Moeller","And relative to the question on, is there reapplication potential here, I think definitely the answer is yes. There's a lot of what I've seen here and previously what Matthew was talking about earlier some of the digital capability has clear, replication potential, our experiences with marketing and moving more to a pole versus a push model is certainly has reallocation. There's a lot of exciting learning here that we will be replying globally.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes in line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Hi, there, thank you so much. I love to just dig a little deeper into the China situation because I know a lot is riding on the Japanese input. But I think you said 75% of your business is still in non-premium well not the super-premium diaper. Couple of things, can you just explain a little bit what the strategy is to grow the other part of the business? Can you talk about whether there has been in any comparative response and just any detail on the growth and your strategy going forward? I was hoping to see or hear a little more detail on the successful of the launch but it sounds to me like you really don't know yet?","Jon Moeller","A couple of things there, one, I mean we just launched in August, so relative to July, August and September results was a very short period of time that product was actually end-market. And as I indicated earlier, it's the first time we've built share in the premium tier for a long period of time, so while it's still very early, it certainly is working.","Matthew mentioned the ratings and reviews which are our parity with top competitors which is also encouraging and very important in a China context. And the mainline diaper or the mid-tier which is you rightly said was 75% of the year ago business. That I mention in the prepared remarks, the decline there is largely an inventory related dynamic going all the way through the wholesale channels related to the timing of innovation and price. And I think Matthew we saw relatively flat consumption across last part of the business during the quarter, is that right?","Matthew Price","We've seen actually our total assumption up pick picked up a little bit and we just thought our latest hyper share which shares to the first time in building total shares. So very early days but looks like the assumption is picking up and we believe from all the consumer ratings and reviews that we have a win on our hand, we also are betting big on pants where we have made great progress from number five as number one that we really drive the big growth in time both on high and mid-tier.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Thank you. Good evening, guys. Both my questions been answered here I guess but I did want to shift back to ecommerce for a second, I think it's about 5% your sales and growing 40%, so the math there is pretty straightforward. And I think you've also said that your offline and online shares are pretty similar, but the first which of your businesses be over index and under index in terms of online versus offline shares? And then secondly what is the impact on margins given how quickly this channel shift is happening? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So online versus offline share or is this different by category by market, so within the same category can be very different by market, within the same market it can be very different by category. So I don't have a universal answer for you there. It's also impacted pretty dramatically by the structure of the market in terms of for example whether people have, whether people are using public transportation or private transportation, whether they can handle bulky products or not, they has to do with the relevance of categories in different markets, but maybe that to shine some light on this, let's just talk China, I think Jasmine probably the e-com market index is more to skin care than any other categories, is that right?","Jasmine Xu","Yeah actually e-com is very much good to skin care, the beauty care as well the high-end of the personal care including razors, power brush as a premium care brands et cetera. So it is a very much beauty and high-end product.","Jon Moeller","Whereas for example going back to my comments, if you look at the U.S. market it tends to be over developed and products that are bulky, so diapers, paper towels, liquid detergent are tend to be overdeveloped, but it's very different by market. And our strategy is to be fully relevant in any channel that a consumer wants to shop and therefore be well positioned to when regardless of the habits within an individual market.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen","Good evening, everybody. Jon, you mentioned earlier that one of the feedback points from investors that you've met with recently is the desire for you perhaps some faster progression along certain elements of the change program, support for the change program but looking to accelerate some things. Could you share your perspective on perhaps which elements of the change program and I know there are many of them from portfolio to word structure to cost efficiencies, but which element of the change program in your perspective are most conducive or likely to be accelerated as you look forward over the next 12 to 24 months? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","That's a very good question. As you know in our first productivity program, we were able to exceed and accelerate the cost savings significantly versus our going in assumption. That's going to be less easy to do this time because more the savings are coming from very capital intensive redesign of our supply chain. But still there's work we're working to do there, we had a leadership team discussion on that just this week on how we can accelerate some of the productivity savings and we'll work to do that, will update you as we have more perspective.","Also I think there's a strong desire on the part of both the management team and the organization itself to continue advancing some of the changes that we've made in the organization structure and beginning to think as we actively all hear talk this week about if you will version 2.0 and what are the next steps in that in that journey. So I think there's a lot we can do when Sumeet was talking about accelerating the pace to market with innovation as a result of the new organization structure, I think that's something we also have a massive opportunity to be more deliberate about faster time to market, but also faster globalization of great ideas and smart ideas which has historically taken us some time.","So we're going - and look there's nobody who wants this, nobody wants the results faster and better than us and I know the team here, so we'll be working hard on that.","Jon Moeller","Listen thank you everybody. I hope our experiment here was useful to you. If you have any feedback I'd love to get it both positive and negative. And I know I speak for the China team what I say that we really appreciate the opportunity to engage with you. So thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and adjusted for after-tax impact of major divestitures. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings including divestiture gains. Any measure described as Core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items you have posted on its website www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.Now, I will turn the call over to P&Gs Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.Jon MoellerThanks. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Bob McDonald and Teri List. Today we are going to share fourth quarter results, we will also discuss our commitment to deliver leadership levels and total shareholders return. Behind the time tested business model and stronger more focused plans.I\u2019ll begin today\u2019s call with a summary of our fourth quarter results and guidance for fiscal 2013 and the September quarter. We are going to skip the detailed business-by-business discussion. All of this information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which we posted on our website, www.PG.com.During this we will get time for Bob to provide his thoughts on our strategy, our commitment to winning and to leadership levels of shareholder return. We will of course, take questions after our prepared remarks and we will be available after the call to provide additional perspective as needed.With that let me move to fourth quarter results. We grew top line organic sales 3%. Progress was broad based with organic sales up in four or five reporting segments. P&G averaged 4% organic sales growth over the past three years achieving 3 to 5% organic sales growth for the past 11 consecutive quarters. Over this period we have added organic sales of $8.5 billion an amount that equates to the sales of a Fortune 300 company. We effectively created an energizer and (inaudible) in three years.Growth continues to be very strong in developing markets. Developing markets now generate nearly 40% of sales and 45% of our unit volume. It's a $32 billion the largest developing market business of any consumer products company.We see significant remaining growth opportunities as our business in developing markets is still lower as a percentage of sales than some of our competitors. We continue to focus on growing our footprint in the largest most important developed markets to improve our exposure to best-in-class levels.We grew developing market organic sales 10% in the quarter, organic sales in China were up 9%, Brazil was up 17%, India sales grew 21% and Russia was up 18%.We have a strong track record of successfully developing -- a successful developing market growth. Even in our come from behind markets. In 1991, our sales in Asia including India were about $1.5 billion. Unilever sales in Asia by our estimates were $4 billion. So we were about 38% of Unilever\u2019s size in 1991. In 2001, ten years later, we generated $4 billion of sales in Asia and were 57% of estimated Unilever\u2019s size. In 2011 we generated $12.8 billion of sales in Asia, 96% of our estimate of Unilever\u2019s Asian sales. And in the year we just completed we generated $14.7 billion of sales in Asia and estimate we have now effectively maxed Unilever.In the early 90s our sales in Greater China were about equal to Unilever\u2019s at around $0.5 billion. Today Greater China is our second largest market with sales of $6 billion. This compares to Unilever sales of $2.5 billion. I used Unilever as a comparison point simply because they are best in class when it comes to developing market footprint. We have built our developing market shares in eight of the last ten quarters and have held share or grown it in all ten.Developed market sales were down slightly in the quarter we just completed and were below levels reported by or best competitors. Developed market business is a disproportionate focus of strengthened plans and our top 40 category country combinations which we discussed at the Deutsche Bank Conference in Paris. These 40 businesses represent about 50% of company's sales and approximately 70% of operating profit. Trends in these markets should begin to improve over the six to nine months as plans are fully implemented.Total company fourth quarter organic volume was in line with prior year levels. Pricing contributed four points to organic sales growth, positively benefitting all five reporting segments. This marks the fourth quarter consecutive quarter where pricing has added four or more points to sales growth, and the fourth consecutive quarter where pricing has been a positive contributor to growth in each segment. We have several questions about the retrospective wisdom of our price increases. This is an important question which I want to spend a little bit of time on.Over the last few years commodity costs increased by $3.6 billion, which is nearly 25% of our core operating earnings. Letting this all come to the bottom line would have been very punishing for our shareholders and would have compromised structural economics in many markets, significantly reducing the value of future growth. We made what we believe was the hard right choice, taking pricing across our product categories, while acknowledging the market share volatility we knew would result.World competitors, including private label have also taken pricing, we stand in very good shape. Price elasticity at the category level is generally low in consumer staples categories. In some instances where competitors have not taken pricing, we need to adjust. This is relatively easy to do, but takes some time to fully execute. During our last earnings call we mentioned six category country combinations but we have made a decision to roll back prices or match increases in competitive promotion levels.These choices are now beginning to positively impact business momentum. All of these moves were made in the U.S. In three of these categories we have already begun to see the benefit. U.S. laundry market share was down 1.6 points over the past 12 months. Over the past six months, it was down 0.8 points. Market share in past three months is down 0.2 points and in the past month we have built market share of 0.6 points. Within this Tide Value share is up 2.6 points behind the success of premium priced Tide PODS Innovation. We expect this trend to continue as we began merchandising Tide PODS, and our large sized, higher value powder laundry packages reached the market.U.S. male blades and razor share trends are also positive. Past 12 months share was down minus 1.4 points. Past six and three months shares were down 0.7 points. In the past month we grew share by 0.4 points. The strength of our plans on this business will increase going forward. While not yet fully positive share trends in U.S. auto dish have also improved significantly. On a 12-month basis, share is down 5.5 points while past one month share is down only 1 point. The U.S. Oral Care changes we talked about in the last call just went into full effect in July.We have subsequently announced changes in U.S. family care. Where we will take a list price reduction on our Bounty Basic and Charmin Basic lines, and in several Beauty and Health businesses where we will be making targeted adjustments. In total, the investment of price roll backs and increased promotion now represent about 400 million of the 3.5 billion of pricing we put into the market. Many more prices are holding that are not.As I\u2019ve said we have 4 points of pricing benefit to the top line and the quarter we just completed. Unilever had 3.5 points, Colgate had 3.5 points, Kimberly had 2 points, Clorox had 5 points. So, we don\u2019t appear to be differentially exposed to a significant degree.Mix reduced sales by 1 percentage point in the quarter due mainly to over-proportionate growth in developing markets. All-in net sales for the quarter were down 1% versus the prior reflecting a negative 4 point FX impact.Moving to the bottom-line core earnings per share were $0.82 in line with prior year. The core tax rate was 22.4%, higher than last year\u2019s rate of 21.1% but lower than 25% rate included in our initial guidance for the quarter. The lower rate was driven by several favorable audit outcomes and behind stronger developing market results which drove favorable tax mix. The lower rate contributed $0.03 of earnings per share versus our tax guidance.Net earnings were $1.24 per share up 48% versus year ago. This includes the positive impact from the Pringles divestiture which closed in the quarter of $0.48 per share. It also includes $0.08 of non-core restructuring cost.Core gross margin increased 10 basis point, pricing improved gross margin by roughly 220 basis points and savings [projects] helped gross margin by approximately 240 basis points. These benefits were partially offset by a 200 basis point negative impact from higher commodity costs and 100 basis point negative impact from a combination of product and geographic mix.Core SG&A cost were down 80 basis points due mainly to top line leverage and lower overhead costs driven by productivity improvements. An important part of our strengthened plans is our commitment to improve productivity. As one demonstration of this commitment, we significantly over-delivered our overhead productivity targets for the fiscal year.In February, we announced our intent to reduce non-manufacturing enrolment by 3% by June 30. This equated to 1,600 roles. Actual non-manufacturing enrollment is down by 2,000 roles versus last year or 4% ahead of target. There are another 990 individuals whose effective transition date was July 1, 2012. These roles are not included in the June 30 reduction figure of 4%. Through July 1 then, the reduction would be 5% about 60% of objective. We now think we will achieve the majority of our initial 10% reduction target by the end of the calendar year, which represents meaningful acceleration.As part of our productivity work, we have identified additional opportunities to cut cost. We expect overtime to be down by more than 10%, but need the balance progressed on role reductions with the need to reverse trends in developed markets and fuel continued growth in developing markets.Core operating profit continue to improve, growing 4% for the quarter, while not yet where we want to be, we made sequential improvement throughout this fiscal year with core operating profit progressing from down 4% in the first two quarters to up 2% in the third quarter to up 4% in the fourth quarter.Core operating profit margin grew 90 basis points including about 280 basis points of productivity improvements and cost savings. On an all-in basis, including restructuring costs, gross margin was down 40 basis points with all-in operating margin down 30 basis points. All of the decline in reported operating was due to a 120 basis points of non-core restructuring investments.We generated 2.7 billion in free cash flow with quarterly adjusted free cash flow productivity of 142%. Free cash flow for the fiscal year 9.3 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 90% consistent with our target.During the fiscal year we returned $10 billion of cash to shareholders through 6 billion of dividends and 4 billion of share repurchase. We paid a dividend for 122nd consecutive year one of only nine companies to have done this. We increased the dividend 7%; this was the 56 consecutive year we have increased the dividend, one of only six companies to have done this.Over the last 10 years P&G has paid out $42 billion in dividends, excluding 20 billion of share repurchase associated with the Gillette acquisition we repurchased 46 billion in stock. In total through dividend and share repurchase we have returned 88 billion of cash to our shareholders which is 90% of reported net earnings.Returning capital to shareholder through both dividend and share repurchase remains a central pillar of our efforts to deliver superior. But before I get into the details of 2012-13, I would like to step back and provide some framing.Developing market growth and cash flow productivity were both strong in 2012. Developed market growth and earnings progress were not. Our focus and strength in 40-20-10 plan is designed to restart growth in developed markets while maintaining developing market growth. The top four category country combinations are disproportionally developed market businesses. Businesses like North American, Western Europe Laundry Detergent, Baby Care, Hair Care, North American and Western European Shave Care and Feminine Care businesses along with North American Oral Care and Skin Care.We have worked with the leadership team to ensure we have sufficient plans to achieve our objectives in these markets. We are making certain that we have offerings that provide superior performance and value. That our pricing is right. That innovation is strong; that marketing effectively communicates the superiority of our offerings and that there is sufficient marketing support. This will require investment, in pricing as I have described earlier, in innovation and in marketing. Advertising spend in developed markets will increase.Restarting growth in developed markets will have a positive overall impact on profit as these are some of our most profitable businesses. At the same time we will begin to earn a return on the developing market investments of the past couple of years. As we bring more of the portfolio to bear, as we switch local manufacturing plants on, as we continue trading aspirational consumers up, as accretion from previous entries funds new ones, the developing market margins will improve.In addition to all of this is a five-year $10 billion cost savings program which we are implementing and which is on track. As I mentioned earlier, we are ahead of target on the overhead portion of this plan and we will have completed the majority of it by the end of the calendar year, accelerating its benefit. Also as I mentioned, we see opportunities before the reductions and we will be balancing those with the need to make top line progress. Our ending points though will be greater than a 10% reduction on an apples to apples basis.We already have plans to deliver $1 billion of the $1.2 billion we need in cost of goods sold savings for 2012-13, and have established stretched target of $1.4 billion. The plan includes a 5% net productivity increase across our manufacturing operations even as we bring on new manufacturing capacity in developing markets. We are expecting significant savings from our ongoing global supply network design while in the area of transportation new planning tools and capabilities will improve our vehicle fill rate by 1.5 points. We are planning on material savings driven by reformulation, compaction and innovation.We have chosen for next fiscal year to prioritize resumption of developed market growth over efficiencies in advertising. We will still be striving for efficiencies but we will be investing these back in the business. On a going basis, we would expect these efficiencies to come to the bottom line. In addition to focus and strengthen plans where it matters most, and in addition to our cost savings plan, we are increasing the effort being applied to discontinuous innovation, which Bob will talk more about in minute.In a normalized world, in other words absence major exogenous events, we should be poised to significantly accelerate operating leverage and earnings per share growth. And we should be in a position to better withstand exogenous events if they occur, while delivering target levels of earnings growth. One way to think of the growth algorithm is as follows. We grew our top line at the current rate of market growth which is 4%; earnings per share would grow at 4% assuming no operating leverage or share repurchase.$2 billion in savings per year, regardless of whether they come from cost cuts or operating leverage, create an 11 points earnings per share benefit. If we only bring half of the bottom line it would equate to about six point earnings per share benefit. This 6 to 11 point range of savings benefit would take the 4% earnings per share growth to a range of 10% to 15%. Share repurchase should add another two points, taking earnings per share growth potential to a range of 12% to 17%. Developing market profit accretion in any top line growth above market rates, in other words building market share, would be additive to this.If we deliver two-thirds of the 12 to 17 point range due to macro impacts or mix, earnings per share growth would be 8% to 11%. That\u2019s why we are maintaining our long-term earnings per share guidance of high single to low double digits. And I want to be clear that for us, long-term is 2014.With that as background let me turn to 2013. It will take some time to get our plans fully implemented. We won't have a full year of overhead savings, for example, until 2014. Some of the developed market businesses will take some time to write and we will be investing to do this, not counting our marketing efficiencies in 2013. There are also significant macro headwinds; our guidance for 2013 reflects both of these realities.Fiscal year organic sales guidance is unchanged from the preliminary outlook we provided in mid-June. Organic sales growth is expected to be in the range of 2 to 4%. This is comprised of volume growth of 1 to 3%, pricing contribution of about 2%, and negative mix of around 1%. We expect by the back half of the fiscal year, we will return to modest market share expansion. We expect foreign exchange will be a top line headwind of about 4 percentage points based on mid-July spot rates. This brings our all-in sales growth guidance to a range of down to inline versus the prior year.On the bottom-line we expect core earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4. This is the same as the preliminary guidance we provide in June. The growth rate just down to minus 1 to plus 4% as the earnings per share over-delivery in the fourth quarter 2012 hurts our fiscal 2013 earnings growth rate by about 1 point. As I mentioned earlier that over-delivery was largely taxed which is not carry forward.We expect to continue our 56 years track record of dividend increases. The exact amount of the increase is subject to board approval and will be determined by the Board during the April 2013 Board meeting.Our plan now include share buyback of $4 billion in 2013. We continue to value our AA minus rating and our disciplined and managing against it. But given strong cash performance in the last quarter, even lower interest rates, the growing spread between financing cost and our dividend yield, the current stock price and most importantly our growing confidence in our business plan. We have decided to accelerate future share repurchase.Within our fiscal 2013 guidance, we expect approximately $0.04 to $0.05 benefit from a combination of lower interest expense and higher non-operating income. These benefits will be offset by $0.04 to $0.05 headwind from a higher effective tax rate on core earnings.This earnings per share forecast assumes mid-July\u2019s spot prices for both commodities and foreign exchange, foreign exchange rates [came to] 3 point earnings per share headwind without which 2013 earnings per share growth would be 2 to 7%. Commodities are up modestly on a year-on-year basis.There are couple of significant one-off items included in the guidance, the guidance includes $0.06 per share negative impact from pension and employee benefit plans as a result to provide assumptions for the discount rate used to value planned liabilities and projection return on planned assets. We are also building in about $0.06 per share impact from the combination of recently imposed import restrictions in Argentina and a carryover impact from mandated price reductions in Venezuela.A transparency and enable more informed decision making, we also want to call out some of the potential risks that are not included in our guidance. As I said earlier, our forecast is based on mid-July foreign exchange spot rates. The currency risk includes significant dollar strengthening or a large post election to valuation of the Venezuelan (inaudible). Our guidance assumes current market growth rates; a significant deceleration associated with the European financial crisis or with the fiscal [prep] in the United States would put additional downward pressure on these estimates.Last, where all to assuming within this guidance, the key provisions of U.S. tax code that require regular extension including the R&D tax credit and subpart have looked through rules are in fact extended.One additional item not included in our current guidance is the earnings per share impact from our purchase of the balance of our Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia which was announced last month. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and when completed is expected to result in a 400 to $600 million before tax non-core holding gain. We expect to complete the transaction by the end of the calendar year. Gaining full ownership of the business, we will also have an impact on core operating profit results and will adjust guidance if necessary as the transaction is completed.One last [revisal] on fiscal year guidance, I want to repeat what I\u2019ve said on several previous occasions. We are committed to deliver plans that creates long-term value for shareholders. We won\u2019t chase commodities or currency out of the window just to deliver guidance number. We will execute our plan and we will do it in the most fiscally responsible way we know how.[Highlighting] fiscal year guidance on an all-in basis earnings per share forecast in the range of 3.61 to 3.85. This includes non-core restructuring investments of $0.15 to $0.19 per share. Including both core and non-core spending we expect to make restructuring investments of up to $1 billion in fiscal 2013. We expect free cash flow productivity will again be around 90% of net earnings, consistent with our long-term target. This includes a forecast for capital spending of around 5.5% of sales as we continue to expand production capacity in developing markets. The July September quarter will be our toughest, both from a competitive standpoint and from the standpoint of planned momentum, both on top line and as it relates to the savings.We are estimating organic sales in the range of flat to up 2%; within this we expect pricing will contribute three points to sales growth. Foreign exchange is expected to reduce sales by 6%, which leads to all in sales in the range of down 6% to down 4% versus a year ago. On the bottom line we expect September core earnings per share in the range of $0.91 to $0.97 or down 10% to down 4% versus base period core earnings per share of $1.On an all-in basis, we estimate earnings per share in the range of $0.83 to $0.91. This includes non-core restructuring charges in the range of $0.06 to $0.08 per share. Foreign exchange is currently estimated to have a five to six point impact on the bottom line in the first quarter which is driving most of the difficult comparison. July, September volume in sales growth are also the lowest of the four quarters. For the balance of the fiscal year, we currently expect quarterly organic sales in the -- growth in the range of 3% to 4%, with modest improvement each quarter, as we restore momentum in our top 40 category country combinations.On the bottom line, we currently expect core earnings per share growth for the balance of the year in the range of 1% to 6%. The improvement versus the first quarter is driven by the elimination of the foreign exchange headwind; improve top line, increasing cost savings and the timing of non-operating income benefits. Now let me turn it over to Bob.Bob McDonaldThanks, Jon. The whole P&G organization is committed to generating superior levels of shareholder return. We intend to do this through our commitment to win with consumers for offering branded products and superior quality and value, and by focusing on our largest and most profitable businesses. And through our $10 billion cost savings program. We have continued to grow our business during the most difficult economic periods since the great depression.We have done exceptionally well growing our top line and developing markets, but they have come up short on top line growth in developed markets and on bottom line growth overall. We have implemented three meaningful changes to address our shortfalls. The first is our 40-20-10 focus. Focusing resources on the 40 largest and most profitable businesses, many of which are in developed markets. On our 20 largest innovation and on the ten most important developing markets.As a first priority we are ensuring that we have sufficient plans to achieve our objectives in the 40 largest category country combinations. We have to make certain that we have offerings that provide superior performance and value, that our pricing is right. That our innovation is strong, and that the marketing effectively communicates a superiority of our offerings and there is sufficient marketing support, and we have done this. The second change is a deliberate refocus on discontinuous innovation. Innovation that obsoletes current offerings and creates new categories and new brands. Items like Tide PODS, Swiffer Crest White Strips or [zequel].This of course comes on top of our commitment to ongoing innovation on our base business. In 2012, we spent more than $2 billion on innovation. 45% more than our next largest competitor. Innovation is at the heart of our business model and at the heart of our company. We are focused on driving our top 20 base business innovations, like Tide PODS, Always Radiant, Bounty Trap & Lock, Downy UNSTOPABLES in 2013, and advanced a promising pipeline beyond. But some of our fasters periods of growth and some of our largest and most profitable present day businesses were driven by discontinuous innovation; Disposable Diapers, Liquid Laundry Detergents, Home Care items like Swiffer and Febreze.We need to get back after this in a meaningful way. In late July, we met with our global leadership to review and increasingly promising pipeline of new category and brand opportunities. While it will take some time to get some of these innovations ready for market, I can assure you, we have meaningfully advanced our work in this area over the last year. We should begin seeing the lead items in this portfolio enter the market in fiscal 2014.The third change is the $10 billion productivity program we announced in February and that we are progressing. As Jon said, we significantly over delivered one piece of this plan in fiscal 2012 reducing enrollment well ahead of targeted levels.In addition to these three changes, we are improving execution in all parts of the company, better execution will help us to overcome macro challenges, manage competitive threats and get the maximum benefit from our innovation, marketing and productivity programs. We are also maintaining accountability in all levels. In aggregate, short-term bonus awards will be below target, three year performance awards are currently tracking to average 35% of target.In the last two years the stock options are currently under water. We all acknowledge this reflects the level and quality of our results. We have the right metrics to (inaudible) results that are aligned with shareholder objectives. Our long-term bonus metrics are simple, organic sales growth relative to competition, organic earnings growth, EPS growth and free cash flow productivity; the four drivers of total shareholder return.We have aligned the entire company next year on short-term metrics of volume and sales growth, market share, operating profit growth and productivity which is delivering against the $10 billion plan, cash flow and internal controls. These are the metrics that we will measure ourselves against and that you can measure our progress by. We will be updating you on them as the year progresses.With these changes, we should be poised to seize opportunities for top and bottom-line growth which are meaningful. We have significant opportunity for revenue growth to increase market share on our established businesses by expanding our portfolio of superior branded products into the most promising markets and price theatres.And by innovating to expand markets and create new ones. Our productivity opportunity is substantive and the program is in place. This will help us finance top line growth, ensure our consumer value propositions are superior, overcome macro headwinds, and deliver better bottom-line growth. We are ahead of our targets to reduce non-manufacturing enrollment and have already identified and staffed $1 billion of the $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings we need in fiscal year 2013.We have taken decisive action, but this company wasn\u2019t built overnight. It will take some time to restart growth in developed markets; it will take some time to get the savings program to full run rate levels. We are committed to doing the job right and are taking the appropriate steps to do this. It will take some investment to ensure our brands are priced appropriately, our marketing plans are robust, and to restart innovation where it's been lacking.We are committed to make those investments fueled by improvements in productivity and cost. We will move forward with urgency but with balance, balancing developing and developed market growth, balancing top and bottom-line and balancing short and long-term results. I know we will deliver.One source in my confidence is Procter & Gamble\u2019s long track record of success. Over the long periods of time when Procter & Gamble successfully execute its business model, it is consistently delivered and it has outperformed. Measuring from the end of each quarter, rolling 10 year returns have exceeded both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 82 out of 88 periods or 93% of the time.Enrolling 20 years returns have exceeded both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 46 out of 48 periods or 96% of the time. Within this longer term track record, there have been shorter periods like the last couple of years of underperformance. These are typically been followed by periods of strong outperformance.This past track record does not in any way guarantee future success, it does reflect though the strength of the time tested business model. Our business model which Jon described is centered on consumer insights, superior products and compelling advertising. It is a time-tested model in both good times and bad. With this model P&G has built the largest and most profitable Household Care business in the world. We built the largest most profitable Beauty and Grooming business in the world.We have also built one of the largest and most profitable consumer Healthcare businesses in the world. With this model we have created $25 billion brands, the latest being SK-II and Vicks. In our categories, we have three times more billion brands then Unilever, which is our next largest competitor. And more than Kimberly-Clark, Colgate, Reckitt, Energizer, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Henkel and Church & Dwight combined. The model, when executed, works.It's working now in developing markets. It's working globally in Pampers, our first $10 billion brand. It's working in Prestige Beauty, it's working on Vicks, it's working in home care. We now need to more fully fund it through improved productivity and more consistently execute it. It will take some time to get back on the trajectory we want, but I give you my commitment that we will get back on this trajectory. We know what has to be done at Procter & Gamble, and we are taking the right steps to get it done.One of my greatest sources of confidence it will get done, is the quality and capability of Procter & Gamble people. They are Procter & Gamble's most important competitive advantage. Along with our business model, we have a successful time-tested people development model. It starts with the very best people. Last year we had about 1 million applicants for fewer than 5,000 jobs around the world. We give people responsibility enabling them to develop and we build them into the best leaders in our industry.This combined with continued strong progress in developing markets, substantive annual cost savings and a strengthened core, should generate the kind of earnings progress that will put us among the best in our industry. This combined with our strong cash flow and track record of capital, return to shareholders; including the recent resumption in share repurchase makes P&G, in our view, an excellent long-term investment opportunity with substantial upside. We look forward to creating significant value for P&G shareholders and we will be reporting back to you on our progress along the way. That concludes our prepared remarks and now Jon, Teri and I would be happy to take your questions.Question-and-Answer Session","Operator(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Bank of America. You may proceed.Christopher Ferrara - Bank of America\/Merrill LynchCan we talk about the mix a little bit? Obviously, you've talked, I think about long-term you think what the mix effect is on the top line. But bottom line or gross margin I should say, it\u2019s hit you guys by about 200 basis points a quarter. This quarter it dropped to 100 basis points. I was wondering if you could try to frame a little bit. Put a little color around, first that drop from 200 to 100, right, in this period. I am trying to understand how high that wall is that you have to climb on cost savings to get to EBIT growth. And can you talk a little about; try to take a shot at what you think the long run kind of negative margin mix would be on product and geography? Thanks.Jon MoellerPart of the reason for the improvement in the last quarter is that we got full pricing for devaluation into the developing markets and so that that mix impact on that disproportionate growth in developing markets was less negative, than it would've been prior to that pricing being fully reflected. But also -- it also reflects, and this should be something that we continue to see going forward, improved progress and profitability in developing markets, behind the things we\u2019ve been talking about for quite a while. Getting local sourcing in place, benefiting from the full scale of the portfolio as it gets put in place. And then we continue to see really significant trade-up in developing markets which is also improving margins. So, as those margins improve, the mix impact of disproportionate developing market growth also improves. I don\u2019t have the specific number for you Chris in terms of what to expect going forward, but we will try to work on that and give you some dimensionalization of it.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.Bill Schmitz - Deutsche BankJust wanted to ask one question if I could, would you guys be able to give us the productivity savings in that 10 billion, either every quarter or every year. So I think that\u2019s kind of important thing to track. And then my main question is, so I guess about 32% of the portfolio had market share flat or up in the quarter, which obviously was nice little uptick in June. Can you give us that metrics for the U.S. and then tell us what the U.S. growth was and sort of leaving the quarter, did you see any good signs of progress in the U.S. market share trend.Jon MoellerSo, first Bill, on tracking the 10 billion of course, we will definitely do that. It will probably be more of annual or every six month report back as appose to every quarter, but we will definitely do that. And you can imagine we are doing that internally, it's part of our performance metrics. So, we should have that ability. Bob, do you want to comment on market share?Bob McDonaldYou are right Bill, we said that market share was about 33% one-third for the quarter, but ticked up to about 45% over the last month, and Jon covered some of the progress that we are seeing in market share gains in the U.S. in the categories where we have taken the corrective pricing action.Jon MoellerMoreover we strengthened our plans.Bob McDonaldWe strengthened our plans.Jon Moeller(Inaudible) with the Tide PODS addition for example.Bob McDonaldYes, in Tide PODS as you recall we added 2.5 points to the share PODS.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.Dara Mohsenian - Morgan StanleyFirst, can you give us your commodity and tax rate assumptions for fiscal 2013 and do you have a total cost savings number for fiscal 2012, maybe I missed it? And then the real question, I was hoping for more detail on organic sales growth guidance in Q1, because you sounded pretty enthusiastic that some of the recent strategy changes and price adjustments you have made paid off in terms of improved market share in June, but if you have already made those adjustments and have an Olympic boost, I guess why is top line decelerating in Q1 despite the easier comp and then why do you think it will reaccelerate in the balance of the year beyond Q1?Jon MoellerSo first, tax rate for next year think of kind of 25 to 26%. And as I mentioned in my remarks we currently see commodities up modestly so flat to up probably less than $100 million next year. Relative to top line sales growth versus the quarter we just completed we will have less pricing -benefit as we start to annualize some of the price increases that we have taken. So, that's the primary reason you are seeing that deceleration and then as we go through the year and the 40-20-10 plans are fully implemented, we will start to see stronger momentum in out period. It's not we go from zero to 2 to 3 to 4, so it's not a massive acceleration. But those are the two underlying dynamics that are driving those trends.OperatorYour next question is from the line of John Faucher from JP Morgan. You may proceed.John Faucher - JP MorganIn looking at the relative success in emerging markets and the problems in developing markets, particularly what appears to be an overreliance on the U.S. from a profit growth standpoint? Can you talk a little bit about how you view the role of the GBU and if you look at most of your multinational competitors they do have more of a regional basis for the P&L. How do you guys look at ensuring that all the GBU is not run into the same side of the boat so to speak in terms of over relying on the U.S. from a profit growth standpoint?Jon MoellerFirst of all, I think it's important to understand how our GBUs are organized. We are really organized as regional business units that report up to a global head and so we try to maintain that presence at a regional level. And in terms of making sure that everybody run to the same side of the boat, we have very specific portfolio roles for geographies, both top and bottom-line, just as we do with business units and we manage it that way.Bob McDonaldAlso, John, it\u2019s important to know that the whole focus on the 40-20-10 plan is about making sure we invest and resource our business where it matters most. And that is what a GBU President does and then of course there's oversight by the Vice Chairman of GBUs, Dimitri Panayotopoulos, and Jon and I as we meet with the GBU presidents. So in terms of a pendulum from one side to the other or exploiting one geography or another, it\u2019s unlikely that would happen.OperatorAnd your next question is from the line of Lauren Lieberman from Barclays Capital. You may proceed.Lauren Lieberman - Barclays CapitalI just want to ask a little bit about mid-tier innovation. Because I know that as you started talking about refocusing on discontinuous and that I think we will start to see flow through in fiscal \u201914, one piece that felt kind of missing to me versus your plan laid out a few years ago was more mid-year innovation but particularly in developed markets. I know there has been a lot in developing. So can you talk about how that may or may not be playing a role in your plans at the top 40 going forward? Thanks.Bob McDonaldThanks, Lauren. It still is strategic for us to have a full vertical portfolio of offerings in every category. So that is part of our strategic plan and it is part of our innovation program. So, for example in laundry in the United States you would go from Tide TOTALCARE or Tide PODS on the high end. Tide TOTALCARE being priced about 160 versus average Tide, down to Gain at maybe 85 index or Era at 65 index, in pricing versus average Tide. So the same would be true, for example, in Skin Care with Olay, you can buy a product for as much as $6, or you can buy a professional product for as much as $45. So, we want to have a full vertical portfolio and we'll innovate at each one of those price points for the consumers that those products serve.Jon MoellerAnd you will see entries, Lauren, in the mid-tier, in the year that's coming up in developed markets.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Nik Modi from UBS. You may proceed.Nik Modi - UBSJust wanted to talk about category growth. A lot of focus on market share, given the fact that you guys are so big in your categories and typically the leading brand, just wanted to get your perspective on kind of how you\u2019re thinking about category growth philosophically as you look to kind of recover the top line?Bob McDonaldWe think it's our responsibility, Nik, to grow the categories for exactly the reason you said. Our retail partners, if you look at the Advantage Survey or the Cannondale Study, they recognize us having a comparative advantage versus our competition for growing category sales. So something like Tide PODS, for example, which is the most concentrated form of laundry detergent you can buy. Because of that concentration, it grows the category. And since we've launched Tide PODS, we've not only grown the share of Tide and grown the share of our laundry category, but we've also significantly increased category growth. Another example would be the Febreze car strip, which is a new kind of air freshener in the auto category which has grown the category substantially. When we innovate, when we introduce new items, when we improve the items that are in the market, we work hard to make sure we grow the category.Jon MoellerAnd you'll remember, back to CAGNY, Nik, we showed a couple of slides about our philosophy on developing markets and how it's all about category growth as a much more important component of overall growth. And that continues to be what we're seeing as well as we bring innovation into developing markets, the majority of the growth is sourced through market growth.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research. You may proceed.Wendy Nicholson - CitigroupMy first question is just a little bit of a follow-up. If you're focusing on the 40 largest businesses and that only represents 50% of your sales, isn't it logical to assume that the other 50% of your sales is probably going to continue to underperform and so maybe us all focusing on that market share metric, the 45% of the business or 55% of the business. Maybe that's not a fair indication of how your business is doing because I would imagine 50% is going to continue to really kind of lag.But then my other real question is, I remember when AG announced his strategy and I think his was top ten customers, top ten countries, and top ten categories. And I remember at the time, the customer, there was a big differential between how much money P&G made or how profitable the business was with some of the top customers as opposed to the smaller customers. And I'm wondering if that should be a focus now or is there not so much of a spread maybe between what you make in various types of retail channels? Thank you.Bob McDonaldThanks, Wendy. The top 40, top 20, top 10 process while encompassing or comprising 50% of our sales and 70% of our profit, there is no intention to just simply disregard the rest of the business. And when you include the top 40, then you include the top 10 developing markets, you've got a pretty good swath of our business. In comparison to the program you talked about with AG which is really big customers, big brands, big countries. It\u2019s the same approach, which is to make sure we focus on where our business matters most, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.In terms of profitability of customers, there's really not a difference by customer. What you really see, if anything, is a difference by channel. But we treat the customers the same and support, consistent with Robinson-Patman Act, and support them consistent with our innovations. In fact, right now if you went into virtually any store in the United States, you would see a large number of displays of Olympic featured Procter & Gamble products. We\u2019re in about 4 million stores with displays right now all over the world. And obviously we work with retailers to support those displays and to sell as much product as we can.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello from Oppenheimer. You may proceed.Joseph Altobello - OppenheimerI guess first question, could you outline some of the changes that you have made internally on the innovation front in order to bring more impactful innovation, more discontinuous innovation to the market quicker? And then secondly you talked about the increase in advertising investment next year, just rough estimates, if you could quantify what we\u2019re looking at in terms of the year-over-year increase in advertising next year. Thanks.Bob McDonaldRelative to the discontinuous innovation, Joe, we've taken a number of steps. One is we've created a new business creation organization, call it NBC, reporting to Dimitri, the Vice Chairman of GBUs and also with the lot of oversight from my myself. And the whole idea there is to have people working on innovating in the seams in places that would fall between the organization boundaries. So, for example, a product like Swiffer would involve chemistry, would involve paper technology, would involve apparatus technology. No single GBU would develop that. It falls between the seams, so we need people working on that. Secondly, we put an experienced Group President in charge of that organization. It's Jorge Mesquita. Jorge has a track record of having developed a number of discontinuous innovations. When he worked with me I ran fabric and Home Care and he led our Home Care business and grew Febreze, grew Swiffer to significant pieces of business for us. Third is we have funded all of this activity and we focused the organization on it. Fourth is we have done training the organization on discontinuous innovation. We worked with Clayton Christensen from Harvard Business School who has helped us. And I think that's about it. There are more things, but they are more minor.Jon MoellerAnd in terms of the increase in advertising, Joe, obviously that's something that's somewhat fluid depending on how plans work or don\u2019t work, but I\u2019d think of it for now as up 30 to 50 basis points.Bob McDonaldThere\u2019s one other thought and it wasn\u2019t, we didn't knew it just for discontinuous innovation, but as an evidence of our scale of the Procter & Gamble company, we have taken a new approach in research and development called transformative platform technologies where we have identified nine technologies that span our business units. Think of these as technologies that are so breakthrough that no individual business unit could afford to invest in them on their own; but on the other hand, the corporation can invest in them. These are like 10 year, 20 year technologies that change the face of our business. One example of this that you would be familiar with is something called solid state technology. This of this as two metal roles that take a substrate between them and change the physical properties of that substrate as that substrate passes between them and provide either stretch properties so you would see that in Baby Care, you would see that in Feminine Care and always on Pampers. But you would also see that in Glad trash bags, the new stretchable Glad trash bags and the new stretchable Glad household bags. This [surfing] technology is a technology that no single business unit could create, but by creating it corporately and then putting it out to the business units, it's a great example of the scale benefit derived from our investment in research and development.Jon MoellerAnd just one clarification point for those who might be confused, we are in a joint venture with Clorox on the Glad business which is why Bob mentioned that.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein. You may proceed.Ali Dibadj - Sanford BernsteinA couple of things. One is, just want to explore the prudence of saying fiscal year \u201813 is going to be back half weighted and the fiscal year \u201814 will return to the long-term growth rate which would be great, but just trying to understand the prudence of that. I guess, I just, I don't get it. I don't get kind of the bullishness around it given some of fits and starts you had to face for the past several years and especially you got to obviously give credit for the track record over 20 year and 10 year of the company, but that's a different time it was a different company. I think you need to do different things than you had done before.So, first question is, do you agree that there are different things you have to do. So you have to be more value oriented that\u2019s to be more in developing market. You have to sell beauty which you didn\u2019t really be doing that whole timeframe and I don\u2019t really know the solution is for Beauty. And you have the cost cut and if I were to focus on cost cutting for the second part, from all your numbers that you presented, you\u2019re very reliant on cost cutting to deliver your numbers and look at the $10 billion restructuring which is great, the strong as you know, it was little late. But that was based on a 5% top line growth assumption, so that\u2019s not happening and I\u2019m trying to understand given you reliance there and given kind of first question, so you have to think really differently. How you\u2019re going to make up that difference? Have you found big new buckets of cost saving because a couple hundred million dollars here and there won\u2019t do it or you are expecting kind of a hockey stick of top line growth to get your 5%? So, are things different? Number one, and you have to do things differently. Number two is, how you\u2019re going to plug the hole in 10 billion bucks given your top-line is not growing the way it was, expected to grow?Bob McDonaldWe believe that the Procter & Gamble Company has a time tested business model. It involves superior products, based on superior consumer insight. It involves the five strengths of the company, branding, go-to market, scale, innovation, consumer knowledge. We think those are enduring just like we think the purpose of the company is enduring. What we're doing now is we\u2019re becoming more focused and more fit to win in this current environment. That\u2019s what our 40-20-10 plans are about, that\u2019s what our $10 billion cost savings and productivity improvement plan is about. That will be the fuel to growth and the fuel to profit, and that's what our discontinuous innovation focus is about. So we think this time-tested business model makes the Procter & Gamble Company an outstanding long-term investment.Jon MoellerAnd relative to a couple of the other points, Ali, on prudence of first quarter guidance, I don't generally consider whether something is prudent or not or consider whether it's accurate or not, and that's where we find ourselves and we try to explain why. In terms of the $10 billion program, I'd say a couple of things. First of all, we've tried to very transparently lay out exactly how that number was calculated, and you've rightly described how that's calculated. So, if you have a different view in terms of what happens with the top line or any component of it, we've given you all the pieces and you can model that any way that suits yourself.I mentioned in my remarks that we have found, as we've gone through this, additional opportunities to reduce cost. I mentioned that I expected us to be, or that we would be, more than 10% below June 2011 levels on enrollment when we're all done. So, it's not like we're looking at the $10 billion figure and saying, that's it. This is about a culture and a mindset that, as Bob said, it puts us in a position to be more fit to win in a very difficult economic environment.OperatorAnd your next question is from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research. You may proceed.Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge ResearchI just would like to understand again better the fiscal '13 plan, basically the financial side and how that guides with your long-term financial and strategic goal? So you left 2012 gaining share, or holding or gaining share on 45% of the portfolio. Your strategic target is to gain share on 65%, if I recall correctly. Are you planning to get there by the end of fiscal '13? If so, is the expanding to get there budgeted in your plan? And also if you can explain this change in the share repurchase issue? You halted it in May and now you're buying it again. You attributed to a debt rating issue but I don't think that it changed that much in a month and a half. So, if you can explain better why is it that now you're restarting share repurchases that you consider a structural change in the portfolio and now you're not considering it? If you can explain the share repurchase issue also as well it would be very helpful.Jon MoellerSure. Let me start with the math for next year, if you will, and how it squares with both the end of the year we just completed as well as the subsequent year. We have, as I mentioned, funded increases in marketing support and we have, as I mentioned, funded investments in pricing. So the investments that are required to deliver that growth acceleration are baked in. And that's one of the reasons that the first quarter is what it is and it's one of the reasons that the overall guidance is what it is.If you exclude foreign exchange from the guidance as we mentioned in the comments, we would be at about 2% to 7% earnings per share growth in 2013. That's not significantly off the bottom-end of the range that I described for 2014 of kind of 8%. And as we get a full year of cost savings in place, for instance from enrollment, as we gain the acceleration in the restarted plans in the developed markets etcetera, and as we don't have the significant one time hurts that we have in the current year due to pension revaluation and due to the Venezuela pricing thing, we should get there.OperatorAnd your next question is from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital. You may proceed.Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital MarketsSome time ago, we had calculated that Procter\u2019s overhead cost per employee was about 40% higher than what we saw as an industry average. I\u2019m wondering if you have benchmarked yourselves against the industry and what you think the right metric there would be and relatedly, it also seem to me as we\u2019re evaluating this that it led to some internal gridlock. So, as personnel count is being reduced, what are the changes in processes or responsibilities that will make the organization more nimble?Jon MoellerConnie, our core SG&A is around 14.5% of sales which based on our benchmarking puts us in the bottom half of 15 company global competitive peer group. Now within that, there is some diversity. In general, the global beauty companies skew very high on this metric. Some is high as 24% of sales and the mainly domestic household care companies skewed at the low end of 9 to 10% of sales. The beauty companies because they have counters, they have beauty counselors, that\u2019s why they are high. The household companies, some of them go through brokers and don't have sales forces, that's why they are low, but based on our mix of business, which is about 53% household care, 33% Beauty and Grooming, 14% health care, we compare well with the weighted average of our peers. However, considering our company scale, we expect to be better than the competitive weighted average. So getting the core SG&A of around 12% of sales, we think puts us in a top third of our competitors on an absolute basis, and about 350 basis points below the weighted average based on business mix.As we go about this work, as you properly pointed out, this is not just about reducing the number of heads it's about finding ways to do the work differently in order to be more agile. That's one of the reasons we've reduced the number of levels within the organization, the hierarchy we\u2019ve talked before about reducing the number of Vice Chairman by 50%, reducing the number of Vice President by 15%, reducing the number of Directors. And while we\u2019ve done that, we\u2019ve digitized the organization to allow them to operate effectively with less overhead.We have also been working to make the process from the creation of the product to selling it in the market more linear. During the time of many acquisitions in the past, we became less linear, we had too many (inaudible), too many people you had to check with, and we are going through a process now in our brand building organization of making that much more linear. Those are two examples. The third example is obviously the creation of global business services, which has saved us about billion dollars in back office activities from 2000 to 2012.OperatorAnd your next question is from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust. You may proceed.Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson HumphreyJust one quick housekeeping; Jon, I don't remember if you said, but for the Venezuela, Argentina and the pension issue, is there any one quarter that impacts or is it all four quarters? And then second just, on kind of looking at the simple changes, any thoughts on another round of compaction. That seems like that will be the easiest way to kind of cut costs and drive sales. It would affect a big part of your organization. And I ask that because this seems like the time of the year that if you are going to do it for next year, you would start announcing it?Jon MoellerSo, first on the housekeeping question, the pension impact is ratably spread across the quarters. The Venezuela Argentina thing is more a front half issue because we anniversary the new law in February in Venezuela.Bob McDonaldBill, as you would imagine, compaction is always on our radar screen in our innovation program. It's good for consumers because it helps them reduce the amount of space product takes, it reduces fillers and it's good for retailers because it reduces the amount of shelf space they have to use. It's good for the environment. It reduces carbon emissions from trucks carrying it around. It reduces ethylene in the environment. So, we are always looking at compaction and every one of our innovation programs has some kind of compaction within it. I\u2019d encourage you when you think about compaction to think about Tide PODS. It's the most compact laundry detergent available. It's got the highest percentage of actives of any laundry detergent in the market and it cleans as well, if not better, than six competitive products at the same time. So, we've just begun the launch. We're going to be rolling it out around the world and that would be a great example of the benefits of compaction.OperatorAnd your next question is from the line of Jason Gere from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.Jason Gere - RBC Capital MarketsJust one thing, looking through your slide deck when you talk about some of the assumptions for the year, you're talking about global market growth of 4% to 5%. Hopefully, I'm not wrong here but I think you guys were talking about 4% over the last couple of months when you gave that number. So when most of your peers are talking more cautiously about Western Europe and even the U.S., it seems like this numbers actually elevated a little bit. So I was just wondering if you can reconcile that?Jon MoellerYou know if you think about -- if we just break it down into pieces, what we\u2019re seeing before was developed market growth of about 1.5 points, developing market growth of about 8 points which got us to 4 on a global basis. What we've seen more recently is a slight uptick in developed, primarily in June and that's growing now at 2 points, developing -- we've actually seen some acceleration, but it\u2019s up at about 10 points right now. So that\u2019s how you get to the 5. But these numbers are very volatile. They move around all the time and that\u2019s why we\u2019re describing it as a range of 4 to 5. So we\u2019ve seen 5 recently. I don't know what that necessarily is representative of the future. We expect it to be somewhere between 4 and 5.Bob McDonaldThis is exactly why the productivity program is so important because should that marker growth slip, we still need to have the fuel to invest in innovation and to invest in growth and that's why we\u2019ve got the $10 billion productivity program.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research. You may proceed.Alice Longley - Buckingham ResearchCould you tell us what the U.S. alone look like in the fourth quarter? Was volume still down to single digits and value sales down, say 2% to 3% here? And then going into the first quarter, is our value sales likely to be down more because of less pricing? And the second part of my question is, could you comment on the quality of what you\u2019re doing to improve your share. And as an example, in blades, it looks like your share is improving because of improvement with disposables and much heavier promotional activity. And I'm wondering if that's how you want to gain share?Bob McDonaldOur U.S. business is strengthening, as Jon talked about in his remarks. Some of the activity is correcting price disequilibrium. But it's important that much of it also is innovation. And the innovation is also what's driving the improved shares. An example of that would be continued growth on ProGlide, for example, in blades and razors. And we have future innovation coming, so we're expecting the U.S. business to continue to strengthen.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel Nicolaus. You may proceed.Mark Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co.I was wondering why do you think the decision to focus on your ten largest developing markets or, as you said, not going into other new markets, is the right decision for the long-term? Why is it not shortsighted where it gives competitors an opportunity to develop a beachhead, so to speak, and ultimately put you at a disadvantage where you have to play catch up again?Jon MoellerSo, fully, fully agree with developing markets being a priority and a strategic imperative as we look forward. We have significant opportunity in those ten large markets. And by markets, you shouldn't confuse the word market with country. These are often times regions or country clusters where we go to market very similarly. So we refer to them as one market. If you look at what's ahead of us in developing markets, I think it's an incredibly exciting thing for both consumer products companies in general, and particularly Procter & Gamble.We're looking at population growth to 2020 of 700 million people globally, 95% of which are going to be in developing markets. We're looking at the addition of 1.5 billion middle income consumers, 98% of which are going to be in developing markets. We are I think at the precipice of one of the biggest trade-up cycles that we\u2019ve ever seen. You have got growing populations, growing income levels and very aspirational consumers. So, we couldn\u2019t agree more with the need to be fully present and we feel comfortable with the top 10 as being actually the way to maximize our presence in those markets and we will get to the others as time and funding allow.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser from Caris & Company. You may proceed.Linda Bolton Weiser - Caris & CompanyI was wondering, Bob, if you could address this company culture a little bit, because I remember when you first became CEO, sitting in meetings with you and you talked a little bit about it and how you felt. There are needed to be some tweaking of the culture and you sounded like a tough guy quite frankly that there needed to be, I forgot your exact words, but ramifications for non-delivery etcetera. Can you talk about how the culture has been tweaked a little since you have been CEO and in what ways you have been happy with the cultural change or not happy or maybe you think there needs to be more or just talk about that issue a little bit?Bob McDonaldWell, I think we are making progress in strengthening the culture and what I mean by that is, I\u2019ve talked about in my remarks accountability. We hold people accountable to Procter & Gamble Company. If you remember in my remarks, I talked about bonus programs paying roughly on average 35% payout. That's a lone number, that's painful. I also mentioned accountability in terms of leadership. If you compare the leadership that we have today versus the leadership we had three years ago, you would see substantive changes particularly in the Beauty business.I also talked about the need to establish our cultural productivity something that Procter & Gamble hasn\u2019t had during my 32 year career. We\u2019ve had periods of productivity improvement, but they tend to be one-off or episodic and what we are trying to create now is the productivity constancy where we constantly work to improve the organization, the organization effectiveness, the leadership of the organization, the way we do our work, so that we can constantly be turning up the money that we need to invest even in slow macroeconomic environments. So, we\u2019re working very hard on the culture, we\u2019re working very hard on the leadership of the company and frankly we just all got together a couple weeks ago and I\u2019m very encouraged by leadership team we have now. In many ways, I think that I just wish I'd done it three years ago, I think we've got the right team.OperatorAnd your next question is from the line of Victoria Collin from Atlantic Equities. You may proceed.Victoria Collin - Atlantic EquitiesI\u2019d just like to ask a question about the steps that you\u2019re going to be taking to improve and hopefully we accelerate the volumes in the Beauty category. I assume lot of it down to the skin care, particularly in developed markets, but just what steps are being taken? Is it simply trying to capture the consumer or the other productivity or execution issues that you are taking on as well that you hope to improve things? And then secondly, I guess I want to congratulate you on the Olympics advertising. I think P&G has done really excellent job aligning themselves with the competition. And do you see this is making contribution to sales in the first half of next year, will there be a second lag of advertising now to link P&G or link your name to the brands and get the sales up. And is it one of the ways that you're looking to raise advertising and also regenerate sales in the developed markets?Bob McDonaldRelative to Beauty, Beauty is one of the primary focuses of our 40-20-10 focus program. There are parts of our Beauty business globally that we\u2019re very happy with. But there are also parts that we\u2019re unhappy with. We\u2019ve talked for some time about Pantene North America. We\u2019ve talked for some time about Olay North America. And we\u2019re working through innovation, through better consumer insights, through better advertising to improve the results of those brands.Secondly on the Olympics, thank you very much for your comments. The Olympics sponsorship is really a terrific example of Procter & Gamble scale brought to life. It's the largest multi-brand commercial program that we\u2019ve ever done. We've got 34 brands, and we\u2019ve got displays right now in more than 4 million stores around the world, and that last for six-month period. It started last March, April as you know, probably with Mum's Day in London, and it's going to continue after the Olympics this week. In fact, after the Olympics and in the next couple of weeks, we start the Paralympics which is part of our sponsorship as well. The program has got a 50% higher return on investment versus our typical single brand program. We've generated a lot of awareness through social media with 6 million views of advertising online so far. And the benefits of the program extend well beyond the London Olympics as I said. We still expect to fully deliver about $0.5 billion in incremental sales over a 12-month period, and we've consistently demonstrated a 5% to a 20% increase in sales when retailers run Olympic displays.We also have seen a tremendous advantage when our brands are linked back to our company, the Procter & Gamble Company. While this looks like something new, it really isn't all that new. When I worked on the new brand in Procter & Gamble in 1980, we were allowed to put, this is from Procter & Gamble, on the brand for six months during the first six months of launch. When I was living in Asia from 1991 and 2001, we ended every ad that we had in Asia with a placard that talked about Procter & Gamble and improving lives. And we have experienced throughout the world that Procter & Gamble is the glue that pulls all the brands together enabling these massive multi-brand merchandising and displays, but also leading to the credibility of the brands and the credibility of the company.As you can imagine, we've researched this in many countries around the world and this is a positive connection. So, we will continue it, and obviously we will review our Olympic effort afterwards and we'll improve it the next time.OperatorAnd your next question is from the line of Leigh Ferst from Wellington Shield. You may proceed.Leigh Ferst - Wellington ShieldMy question is about how you're managing your focus on the ten emerging markets. What changes have you made since you've announced this focus, and to what extent are they managed differently from established markets?Bob McDonaldIt's a great question, Leigh. What we do is, we get the leaders of the company together, the GBU leaders and the geography leaders. And we work to put together a total company plan. So, for example, if we were to introduce a new category in the country, we would look at what other categories space up against the consumer, against the retailer, against the competitor, and make sure that the plan we put in place in that country is synchronized amongst all the business units. We make sure that the strategies are consistent across business units and it's really a matter of trying to bring Procter & Gamble scale to bear to win in that market.OperatorYour next question is from the line of Tim Conder from Wells Fargo Securities. You may proceed.Tim Conder - Wells Fargo SecuritiesI wanted to circle back to the restructuring tracking just more from a housekeeping item here. It would be helpful rather than every six months or year if we could get that on a quarterly basis. Several other companies much smaller than Procter do provide that that we\u2019re familiar with. The main question though that I have, would be related to part of your guidance here and if you could just maybe expand upon it. The share repurchase when you gave guidance a quarter ago, basically you had no share repurchase for fiscal \u201813 when you gave some updates before. Now you do yet the EPS is in essence unchanged. Jon, is something changed on the expense outlook here to work that dynamic? Is that the part of the investment that you\u2019ve talked about earlier here? If you could just expand on that, maybe give a little reconciliation.Jon MoellerGood question, Tim. Basically we haven't built-in any significant benefit from share repurchase because we haven't finalized the timing of share repurchase. And that timing will have an impact on how much earnings per share, actually earnings per share benefit is there for the year. But, obviously, that provides some degree of flexibility from a lot to a little depending on when we do it. There is nothing that's changed in the expense environment. If anything, things have probably improved a little bit. We've talked about commodities being essentially flat, whereas when we were talking in Paris, for example, we were talking about more of a headwind in commodities. So, we probably have a little bit more flexibility than we had when we were speaking in June.OperatorYour final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA. You may proceed.Caroline Levy - CLSAI think one of the more interesting question or focuses was on management, because some of the problems that have happened over the last several years have been related to maybe who was running various businesses and so on. Can you just run us through if you think at this point in each of your divisions where you need to be already, are there still going to be some tweaks to leadership? And when you talk about bonuses and compensation, how much do people feel that what they do within their existing business is going to drive their comp versus the total P&G performance, and that sort of talks to the benefit of being one large company versus you are competing against some people who just do Oral Care or they just do Diapers, or they just do Prestige Beauty. So, how do you get management to everything they need to do if they feel that maybe the whole compensation structure doesn\u2019t (inaudible)?Bob McDonaldI\u2019m happy with the leadership team that we have in place today, very happy. And as I said, I think if you compare the leadership team we have today versus the one we had three years ago, you\u2019d see significant differences. Number two, the compensation systems of the company very much favors the shareholder. Most of us have over 95% of our net worth in Procter & Gamble stock. This company has been a company that in the early days of the company created a profit sharing trust program. Basically, all of my retirement is based in Procter & Gamble stock. I have no pension other than Procter & Gamble stock. Our Medical Care is supported by Procter & Gamble stock. Our bonus programs are based on Procter & Gamble stock. So, our leadership is very, very much focused on total shareholder return and Procter & Gamble stock and that's why the comment I made about the payout being only averagely 35% that's still going to be paid in Procter & Gamble stock and restricted shares. So, that's significant.Secondly, while it is true that part of the compensation program is a mixture of business unit performance as well as company performance, even when we do that metric, we have a company factor in there. And when the leadership team got together last week, we suggested and we all agreed that we focus on seven metrics for the entire organization and we are doing that. So, we are united more than ever before, as I have said in my remarks, on those metrics that matter most to total shareholder return and every leader of the company is focused on that.Jon MoellerJust one other point Caroline, when you were talking about the challenges of managing a big company as opposed to smaller focused company. I think it's important to understand how we actually manage the business which is actually very focused. The daily business of the company is managed by leaders of individual business units. They are focused on only one thing, they have one job; growing sales and profit of their business and they get to do that with all of the assets of the Procter & Gamble Company behind them. And unlike many of their competitors, they don\u2019t have to concern themselves with back office activities, treasury, tax, investor calls. They have got one job. So, it's actually a very focused approach and more focused than even some of their smaller competitors.OperatorLadies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference.

P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Additionally, the company has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","- joining me this morning. I'm going to provide an update on company results. David will update us on key strategy and focus areas. We'll close with guidance and then turn to your questions.","We continue to make important progress: strong volume and consumption growth, earnings per share at or above target, cash above target, market share is improving. Progress, though room for improvement on all metrics, most notably the top line. Organic volume grew 2% for the year, 3% in Q4. Organic sales growth fell just shy of rounding up to 2%. Eight of 10 global categories grew organic sales. In aggregate, these categories grew at over a 3% pace.","Online sales grew 30% for the year to nearly $4.5 billion in sales, approaching 7% of our total business, roughly the size of the next two largest consumer e-commerce businesses combined. We added nearly $1.2 billion of e-commerce sales in fiscal 2018 after adding about $1 billion in sales in fiscal 2017.","All-channel consumption grew at a faster rate than sales, between 2% and 3%. As a result, our share positions improved. Fiscal 2018 market share trends improved in eight of the 15 largest countries versus the prior year, with fourth quarter trends better than fiscal year average in 10 of 15. Market share trends advanced in seven of 10 global product categories, with improvement as the year progressed. We held or built e-commerce value share in eight of 10 product categories.","We made good progress in our two largest markets. U.S. all-outlet value share improved from a 30 basis point decline in fiscal 2017 to flat for fiscal 2018 to 30 basis points share growth in April-June. Seven of 10 product categories grew all-outlet value share in Q4. Seven of 10 categories improved their share trends on a past-six-months versus 12-month basis, and on a past-three-month versus six-month basis.","All-outlet unit consumption grew 2.5% for the full year in the U.S. and was up more than 3% in the fourth quarter. We continued the strong turnaround in China, improving from a 5% sales decline in fiscal 2016 to 1% growth in 2017 to 7% organic sales growth last year. Sales growth accelerated as the year progressed, growing 6% in the first half and 8% in the second half, including 10% organic sales growth in Q4. Six of seven categories are holding or growing sales, up from one of seven categories two years ago.","We generated about $1.6 billion in e-commerce sales, nearly 30% of the China business. Our global top line was challenged by several unexpected disruptions. In Brazil the worst transportation strike in more than 20 years, virtually shutting down shipments for two weeks; Saudi Arabia and the Gulf markets contracted significantly due to sharp increases in utility and gas prices, higher taxes, and an exodus of foreign workers; renewed trade restrictions with Iran; Algerian bans on imported products; severe consumption contraction in Egypt and Nigeria due to high inflation; and decreasing affordability following more than 100% currency devaluation.","Organic sales in these markets declined 13%, off a $2.2 billion base, a 40 basis points drag on companywide organic sales growth. Global retail inventory reductions took an additional 30 to 40 basis points out of sales as customers managed cash and purchases shifted to e-commerce.","As you know, we've been pointing to challenges in two categories: Grooming and Baby Care. While there's still more work to do, we've made significant progress on both. Global Shave Care share was in line with prior year, with Braun share up 0.5 point. We improved U.S. male blades and razors value share from a 4-point decline in fiscal 2017 to nearly flat for fiscal 2018, to over a 1-point increase in the fourth quarter.","We launched Gillette 3 and Gillette 5 razors in the U.S. last quarter to strengthen our position at opening price points for male shaving systems. We've revamped and strengthened our online program, Gillette On Demand, increasing the rate of new user recruitment and retention. We're currently growing volume share and value share on a past three- and six-month basis. U.S. Male Shave Care delivered 3% volume growth last fiscal year with male shaving systems up 5%.","Venus all-outlet share of female blades and razors in the U.S. grew 0.5 point last year and 1.5 points in the fourth quarter. We face new challenges on Gillette, as a value-share competitor is expanding in-store distribution in the U.S., and its competitors are expanding their direct-to-consumer propositions in Europe. We're funding strong plans to protect the business, but competitive actions are likely to have at least some impact.","Baby Care had a challenging year, but we significantly strengthened our long-term position. China sales and share trends improved sequentially through the year. In the fourth quarter, the business grew organic sales mid-single digits, and share progress accelerated, returning Pampers to overall share leadership in Mainland China. Pampers more than doubled its share of premium-tier diapers last year, extended its share lead on pants, and took value share leadership in e-commerce.","Baby Care sales in India, an important growth market for the future, grew 34%. U.S. Baby Care was challenged by aggressive private-label pricing that primarily impacted the Luvs brand, retail inventory adjustments, smaller retail-funded promotions, and a comparison against a base period that included the successful relaunch of Pampers Easy Ups Training Pants.","We've strengthened our consumer value proposition on Luvs, with value share starting to stabilize. We introduced Pampers Pure Protection, diapers and Aqua Pure Wipes in April. In just a few weeks, we achieved share leadership in the naturals segment and tracked channels. Consumer reviews of Pampers Pure have been very strong, and we expect momentum to grow as we drive awareness and trial.","We continue to build on the success of our diaper pant products. Pampers is the global share leader in pant-style diapers, with nearly a 30% share of a form growing at a double-digit rate, positioning us well as the market continues to shift towards pants. New premium-tier innovation and new pack sizes are launching this quarter that include a price increase on most items, equivalent to a 4% increase across the North America Pampers diaper business.","Challenges remain on both Grooming and Baby Care and competition's strong, but we're much better positioned as we enter fiscal 2019 than we were heading into 2018.","Moving to the bottom line, our going-in fiscal year guidance called for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. Despite significant cost challenges nearly double what we expected at the start of the year, increased transportation costs, and increased investments in consumer and customer value, core earnings per share was $4.22 for the fiscal year, up 8% above the high end of the going-in guidance range and at the high end of our mid-year revised range. Commodities and transportation costs were a $500 million after-tax headwind, a 5-point drag on core earnings per share growth. Foreign exchange was a modest earnings help for the year. Tax reform was around a $150 million benefit.","Core operating margin contracted 50 basis points as pricing lagged commodity cost increases. We've grown core operating margin 270 basis points over the preceding four fiscal years, 610 points excluding foreign exchange, and expect to resume margin growth as pricing is implemented to offset commodity costs and as more productivity savings come online. Productivity improvements generated 260 basis points of savings for the year that we just completed.","Our current 21.6% core operating profit margin is among the highest in the industry, and we continue to hold advantages in below-the-line costs. We borrow at some of the most favorable rates in the industry. We have a tax rate that is among the industry's lowest. All of this leaves us with a core after-tax profit margin of nearly 17%, one of the highest after-tax margins in the industry, with three years of the current productivity program still ahead of us.","Cash flow remains dependably strong, with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 104%, well above our going-in target of 90%. We raised the dividend 4%, growing it for the 62nd consecutive year. We paid out more than $7 billion in dividends and repurchased $7 billion of stock, returning more than $14 billion in value to shareowners. Over the last 10 years, we've returned more than $120 billion in dividends and share repurchase, greater than 100% of adjusted net earnings. Our current dividend yield of 3.6% is nearly a full point higher than the Consumer Staples SPDR Fund average.","Detailed fourth quarter results are provided in our press release, so I'll just hit a few of the highlights. Organic volume up 3%. Organic sales were up over 1%. Core earnings per share were $0.94, up 11% for the quarter. All-in earnings per share was $0.72, including $0.14 per share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.09 per share of early debt retirement costs. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 158%.","In summary, core earnings per share growth above the going-in guidance range and at the high end of the revised range despite significant commodity and transportation cost increases; cash ahead of target; strong consumption with improving share trends; sales growing but modestly below our target range; progress in many areas, but again importantly room to improve on all metrics, particularly organic sales growth. David?","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","I'd like to add some perspective on our results, especially the top line sales and share growth, as sales growth was softer than we want but share is showing why I am confident the interventions are working and moving us forward in a sustainable way.","We have more brands, categories, and countries growing than we did last year or the year before. The trends over time are very clear. Importantly, the improvements are driven by the strategic interventions and plans, starting with interventions to improve the superiority of our products, packages, communications, go-to-market, and value, both consumer and customer.","I'd like to provide some highlights on the progress on brands and markets, and then go into more detail on the actions and the impact of our choices. First some quick highlights. As Jon, said eight of 10 product categories in 18 of our top 25 brands held or grew organic sales in fiscal 2018. SK-II grew more than 30%. Downy grew sales double digits, driving mid-single digit growth on the fabric enhancer category and over a point of value share growth over the past three, six, and 12 months. Eight brands grew organic sales mid to high single digits, including Ariel, Always, Olay, Oral-B, Old Spice, Braun, Febreze, and Swiffer.","Twelve of our top 15 countries held or grew organic sales in fiscal 2018, with six of those growing mid-single digits or faster. Turkey and India each delivered strong double-digit growth, with all categories in each country growing sales. Japan grew mid-single digits, with value share up over 0.5 point for the year and up more than a point the past six and three months. Mexico grew organic sales in mid-single digits. Twenty-six of our largest category-country combinations held or grew market share, up from 21 of 50 last year.","As Jon has said, we have more work to do to accelerate results. We clearly are operating in a very dynamic environment. Changing government policies including tax, trade, and privacy; retail transformation; disruption of the media ecosystem; rising input and transportation costs; and foreign exchange headwinds; with highly capable multinational and local competitors determined to win. We are accelerating changes to meet these challenges and further improve results. This will enable us to spot and capitalize on opportunities, and identify and fix issues faster than we ever had in the past. We will be the disruptors in our industry.","We're investing to improve superiority, our margin of advantage. We're making P&G ever more productive. We are structuring an organization and building a culture that continues to put us in front of change, riding the wave of this dynamic environment versus being hit by it. We're leading disruption across the value chain, innovation, supply systems, consumer communication, retail execution, customer and consumer value, to consistently and sustainably grow sales, margins, and cash.","And next I'd like to offer a few points on superiority, which is really our basis to win. We've made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing, and value, and not just in the premium tier, but in each price tier where we compete. We need to strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. To do this, we've raised our standards for each of these superiority drivers. In brand-country combinations where we judge ourself to be noticeably superior in at least four of the five elements, we deliver meaningful improvement in key business success measures, including household penetration, which is the number of people that buy our brands each year; market growth, critical to us and our retailers; value share growth; sales growth; and profit \u2013 all 80% of the time. When we are superior in just three or fewer of the superiority elements, we grow all of the business success measures 0% of the time.","A few examples of where superiority is driving growth include our Fabric Care business, where in the U.S. we grew organic volumes 6% behind superior innovations like Tide PODS, Gain Flings, and fabric enhancer scent beads. These innovations have been the driving force of Fabric Care market growth. Unit-dose detergents and scent beads have driven Japan Fabric Care to a record organic sales growth of 9%. In Europe, Fabric Care organic sales grew 5% for the second consecutive year, driving category growth and delivering 27 consecutive months of share growth.","Feminine Care has delivered 11 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth, with the combination of outstanding product innovations and packaging on Always pads and Always Discreet in adult incontinence. They've developed compelling marketing campaigns that are building brand equity and driving trial. They're growing the category, earning strong distribution and display of new items. They're driving trade-up to premium variants that consumers view as an excellent value for the product performance they receive.","Turning to Skin Care, Olay and SK-II are serving different segments of the skin care markets, and both are delivering strong results by improving superiority. SK-II sales have grown for 15 consecutive quarters at an average rate of over 20%, including 30% last fiscal year. SK-II's superior product is based on a proprietary formula that works to dramatically rejuvenate the skin's appearance. It's a product that solves problems for consumers in a noticeable way. It's presented in prestige packaging that builds brand equity and consumer confidence in the product.","SK-II's marketing campaign has accelerated growth of new users by connecting to them on a more emotional level while reinforcing product benefits. Excellent retail execution, in stores and online, leverage a rich consumer database in technology like our state-of-the-art skin analysis tool, which we call the Beauty Imaging System, to make a personal connection with consumers. The combination of these support SK-II's premium price and value for the consumer.","Olay in China has delivered five consecutive quarters of double-digit organic sales growth behind superiority across all touch points. We launched Olay Cell Science last year, Olay's first-ever super peptide formula, delivering visible skin transformation in 28 days. We've upgraded Olay packaging to prestige-like quality and attractiveness. We've completely revamped our Olay beauty counselor program. We've reduced the number of beauty counters and upgraded the remaining counters with higher and tighter standards. Our \"Fearless of Age\" campaign, with an empowering message for consumers, has driven consumption and has contributed to strong e-commerce sales that are up 80% fiscal year to date and has grown Olay's market share.","And we've talked about the work we're doing to respond to a changing world and changing consumer needs, including increased demand for natural and sustainable products. We've now introduced products in nearly every category that address these emerging consumer needs. Tide purclean, Gain Botanicals, Dreft purtouch, ZzzQuil PURE Zzzs, Febreze ONE, Whisper Pure Cotton, and more recently we just launched Pampers Pure Protection diapers and Aqua Pure Wipes. Our naturals segment offerings quadrupled sales in fiscal 2018. We expect to more than double sales again in 2019. We're in this game and in this important segment to win.","We're augmenting organic innovations with acquisitions: Native, a natural deodorant, and Snowberry skin care, a naturals brand based in New Zealand. We recently announced our agreement to acquire First Aid Beauty, a full line of prestige-quality skin care products that deliver superior skin health solutions specifically designed for sensitive skin and skin conditions like redness, irritation, and eczema.","We are leveraging lean innovation practices to create and extend product and packaging superiority faster and more cost-effectively than ever before. And Pampers Pure is a good example. It reached the market in half the time of a typical product innovation in a very capital-intensive diaper category. We're using the lean approach to explore how we can solve new problems for consumers, addressing new jobs to be done. We have several new products in various stages of market testing right now and we've brought them to that point at a fraction of the time and investment it would have taken us without this lean approach.","We're making a big move to more deliberately consider and pursue external monetization of P&G innovation in noncompeting industries. And occasionally where we think the benefit of sharing the innovation will enhance value creation and the societal benefit can be meaningful, we may make the technology available within our competitive set. I'll give you an example: Air Assist packaging that we invented for e-commerce shipping of liquids that delivers significantly better visual impression and end use experience, and it reduces plastic usage by 50%. We just started licensing this technology broadly.","We're doing the same with other P&G innovations that provide significant sustainability benefits. We invented a breakthrough technology to revolutionize the plastic recycling industry. It separates color, odor, and other contaminants from recycled polypropylene plastic to purify it into a nearly new-quality resin. By allowing others to utilize and commercialize this technology, we'll lower the cost, unlock value, and improve environmental sustainability of entire industries.","In addition to products and packages, we're improving the superiority of consumer communication and retail execution, as well as consumer and customer value. At this year's Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, P&G and our agencies won 26 Lions for the outstanding work on P&G brand campaigns, including two of the Grand Prix honors for the \"It's a Tide Ad\" campaign, which launched during the Super Bowl, and \"The Talk,\" which started an important conversation about racial bias. We used the forum to announce further commitments to advancing diversity and gender equality in our advertising.","Now, an external measure of our improved retail execution is the global Advantage Monitor Report, an independent retailer assessment of manufacturers across seven key focus areas. Our objective is to be ranked number one overall and the top third versus competition in all areas. For the third straight year, we were number one ranked globally, with the highest number of countries ranking P&G as the number one manufacturer. We also ranked number one in all seven practice areas for the second year in a row, with noticeable improvements in the categories of Business Relationship and Support, importantly Category Development, Supply Chain, and Customer Service.","We've done this by improving our capability to take faster action with customers and align our people with the categories they sell. We've increased investments to improve retail execution, distribution assortment and display, and consumer and customer value, all important elements of our superiority strategy.","We're making good progress on extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution, but we face highly capable competitors who continue to innovate their products and business models. Addressing these challenges and extending our product and package advantages, superior execution, and consumer and customer value will require continued investment. The need for this investment and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the importance of productivity.","We are driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of our business, approaching the midpoint of our second five-year, $10 billion productivity program. We've consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. I expect we'll be at the high end of the range again this fiscal year.","Another area of savings is the elimination of substantial waste in the media supply chain. A year ago, we highlighted the need for media transparency, with five calls to action; one viewability standard; third-party measurement verification; transparent agency contracts; fraud elimination; and brand safety. The entire industry stepped up, including strong partnerships with Google and Facebook to take action on their platforms. The progress has been impressive, about 90% complete on delivering the appropriate standards and measurements. These efforts enabled us to cut waste and reduce media cost by 20%.","In addition, we have eliminated waste related to excessive frequency. A deeper look at third-party data indicated that some consumers were being reached by our ads 10 to 20 times in a month, significantly higher than our suggested average of three. We reduced excess frequency and reinvested these savings to increase media reach, the number of consumers seeing our ads, by about 10% and trial building activities by 50%.","We see further opportunity moving from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand-building enabled by data and technology. In China, where 70% of our media is digital and 30% of our sales are in e-commerce, we have one of the largest data management platforms in the country, which we use for consumer analytics. We can effectively manage frequency and engage people when and where it matters. We saved 30% on digital spending in China while increasing digital reach by 60%.","We're reinventing advertising from mass clutter to less doing more. For example, Olay China was running up to six different ads at a time and changing ads every two months. We now focus on one highly effective ad and stick with it over time. With fewer ads and lower frequency, we focus on creating deeper one-to-one engagement by improving in-store presence. With these interventions, Olay China has delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with media spending down 50% over the past two years.","With our access to data and analytics and experienced purchasing professionals, we can bring more media buys in house. We're returning to one-stop shops where it makes sense, reuniting media and creative. We're implementing a fixed and flow model, reducing the number of agencies on fixed retainers, while flowing creative resources in and out on an as-needed basis.","These changes not only reduce the number of agencies and save money, but lead to better quality, greater creativity, and faster ad development cycle times. We've delivered nearly $1 billion of savings in advertising agency fees and production costs over the last four years. We see more savings potential in these areas, along with more efficiency in media delivery. We expect the majority of these savings to be reinvested in more effective delivery of ads to more consumers.","We're continuing to drive savings in the organization, redeploying resources closer to customers and customers, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our business to operate at the speed of the market. We're focused on cost productivity and cash. We've made great progress on working capital. Over the past five years, we've improved receivables by three days, inventory by 10 days, and payables by more than 30 days.","We're driving out cost in inventory with our supply network transformation. We're making progress toward our vision of synchronizing the supply chain with real-time, point-of-sales data with the consumer purchase triggering updates to our manufacturing schedules and orders of materials to suppliers.","Our six new mixing centers in North America are enabling faster customer response times and optimize mixed product loads to improve customer service levels. P&G consistently holds best-in-class receivables positions. We're making further improvements by leveraging technology, using robotic process automation to digitize key elements of our work process. Over the last three years in North America, we've delivered $100 million in savings and improved cash flow by reducing days outstanding by more than a day while simultaneously improving productivity, reducing roll-off (29:19) by 30% and organizational cost by 50%.","An important cash productivity project has been supply chain financing, which we continue to expand. This program, which is a win for suppliers and for P&G, has yielded nearly $5 billion in cash in the five years we've been driving it. We improved payables by five full days last year on a constant currency basis.","Now, alongside the productivity work, we're making needed organization structure and culture changes to position us to win in the changing retail and competitive landscape. We're moving more resources into the businesses and closer to the consumers we serve with higher accountability, more agility, and greater speed.","We're simplifying organization structure and clarifying responsibility and accountability. We're tailoring the organization to win by category and by market. One great example is Greater China, moving from minus 5% sales in fiscal 2016, all the way to plus 7% in fiscal 2018, behind China-specific innovations, more on-the-ground resources, and better execution across all trade channels at the speed of China.","We can't afford this level of on-the-ground resources by category in all markets. The direction in smaller markets has changed from every category managing low-level activities in each country, to each category building a framework at the start of the year and enabling the local market experts to run the business consistent with those plans. The Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and distributor markets group is a great example. The group has accelerated organic sales growth from double-digit declines to strong growth over the last year.","We're supplementing our internal talent with skilled, experienced external hiring to improve category mastery. We're strengthening compensation and incentive programs. A year ago, we increased the granularity of annual bonus awards, moving from about 20 bonus pools to over 100, tying incentives closer to results individuals deliver.","Last December, we announced that the board's Compensation & Leadership Development Committee modified the performance stock program available to our top 200 or so leaders to include relative sales growth metrics and a total shareholder return modifier to ensure awards reflect performance versus external competitive benchmarks. These changes go into effect this fiscal year.","Last month we announced further adjustments to the annual bonus program, increasing the percentage of total compensation at risk, increasing the weighting of business unit results versus company results, now weighted 70% business and 30% company versus 50%-50% in the past. We've widened the payout factors for the business unit and the company components to 0% to 200% of target and increased the number of people participating in the program.","Each of these organization and culture changes are aimed at creating a company designed to win in today's market, with today's consumer, at the speed of the market: more agile, more accountable, more efficient, more productive. Our focus on superiority, enabled by a strong productivity cost savings program and supported by an improved organization and culture, will yield faster growth, higher margins, and strong cash generation.","I'll turn it back to Jon to cover the outlook for fiscal 2019.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","The dynamic macro environment from this past fiscal year \u2013 geopolitical impacts on markets, tariffs, intense competition, rising input costs, headwinds from FX \u2013 will continue to confront us in fiscal 2019. We've attempted to construct guidance ranges that reflect this reality at their midpoints and through the range.","We expect to make further progress on market share, but there will widely continue to be a gap between retail sales and P&G sales as trade inventories continue to contract, until we annualize more of the investments we've made over the last year and until new price increases are reflected on our results.","We're taking a price increase of around 4% on Pampers diapers in North America. Just yesterday, we began notifying customers across North America that we're taking a list price increase on Bounty, Charmin, and Puffs brands, which averages around 5% across the category on an annual basis. Bounty and Charmin pricing will be effective October 31, and Puffs in February.","As commodity prices and foreign exchange rates continue to move, we'll take pricing when the degree of cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. There is uncertainty and will be volatility with these pricing moves. They will negatively impact consumption. We'll have to adjust as we go and as we learn.","Against this backdrop, we're currently expecting organic sales growth in the range of 2% to 3% for fiscal 2019. We expect organic sales growth to be driven by organic volume growth. Pricing will start the year as a drag on sales growth but should turn positive by the end of the fiscal year.","All-in sales growth is forecast in the range of in line to up 1% versus last year. This includes a headwind of about 2 points from the combination of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures. The all-in outlook also includes the impact of lost sales from the dissolution of the personal healthcare joint venture with Teva at the start of the fiscal year and the assumption that we'll close the acquisition of Merck's OTC business at the end of the calendar year.","Our bottom line guidance is for core earnings per share growth of 3% to 8%. This range includes a $900 million after-tax headwind from the combination of foreign exchange rates and commodity costs, $0.5 billion from FX, and the balance from commodities. At the midpoint of the range, fiscal year core earnings per share guidance is $4.45 per share. Excluding the macro impacts, the low, mid, and top of the core earnings per share range each reflect double-digit earnings per share growth. Interest expense, interest income, and non-operating income will be a net drag of about 2.5 points on core earnings per share growth.","We estimate the core effective tax rate will be in the range of 19% to 20% for the year, adding about 2.5 points to core earnings per share growth. This tax rate is just 2 points lower than we first projected when we discussed the impacts of U.S. tax reform, given we have now had the time to fully assess the nuances of the new laws.","We expect diluted share count to be at 2 percentage points lower in fiscal 2019. We plan to deliver another year of 90% or better adjusted free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in a range of 5% to 5.5%. We'll continue our strong track record of cash return to shareholders. We increased our dividend in April, as I said earlier, for the 62nd consecutive year. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase up to $5 billion of stock in fiscal 2019.","The shares repurchase range factors in the cash required to complete the acquisition of Merck's OTC business during the year and cash spent on other deals. Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices, and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases, or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range. As you consider the quarterly profile of your sales and earnings estimates, please keep in mind the pricing dynamics I described earlier.","We'll mitigate more of the commodity and FX headwind in the second half of the year. Productivity savings should build as the year progresses. As a result we expect somewhat stronger organic sales growth in the second half. Bottom line results will be pressured most in Q1 and improve throughout the year.","Now I'll hand it back to David for some quick closing comments.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","While the external environment presents many challenges, we're making important progress, and we're accelerating the pace of change. Our efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority, to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability are all aimed at one thing: delivering balanced top and bottom line growth that creates value of the short, mid, and long term. We know we have more work to do, but we're up to the challenge, and we're committed to take the actions needed to win.","And with that, Jon and I are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Your question first comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. Good morning.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Good morning.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just want to talk a little bit about pricing overall, at least pricing as it flows through on the P&L being down call it roughly 2% this quarter. In the release and in the commentary today, you talked about a couple of different things. So investments made in consumer and customer value, retail execution, of course driving trial as you've talked about. So if you could maybe parse a little bit for us some of the investments you're making, what's showing up in store, the couponing element, because obviously it was a very big spread between what happened with the U.S. Nielsen data through the quarter and what the reported U.S. organic felt like. And then what your visibility is or confidence is that volume will continue to respond, that this shouldn't be placed in the bucket of they're buying volume and this too shall pass if you pull back on some of these investments that you've mentioned. Thanks.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Okay. I'll make some comments, and then certainly Jon can jump in on a couple more thoughts.","First, the interventions that we've made to date have made sure that we got back in pricing corridors that we know position our brands to win over time. And then the superiority then kicks in when you're in a reasonable range. We've made those across the business, and frankly I'm encouraged by the share results we're seeing. And I feel we've gotten to a very good place now.","We'll have to see what happens going forward with competitive pricing and the pricing we're taking. But right now the trends to me are very positive, indicating the interventions on both customer and consumer product are making a big difference. We announced \u2013 or Jon mentioned a little bit about two of the categories that had been under the most pressure because of rising commodity cost, pricing is going into the market, one now on Pampers in Baby Care, and secondly later this fall on Family Care.","These are aimed to address commodity costs the entire industry is experiencing. So I believe that the interventions that we've made, and the investments we've made, are showing up, whether it's the U.S. or China or across the world, the trends of share growth are indicating that P&G is getting more competitive on the key brands and key categories that really matter to the company's growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about China, because those numbers sounded actually terrific to me? 10% growth in the fourth quarter is great. So, number one, what was the cost of that growth? Did your margins go up or down, maybe for all of fiscal 2018 relative to 2017? What's your outlook for growth in China for fiscal 2019? And I know you said that Baby turned positive in the fourth quarter. But how much of that growth was driven just by SK-II and Olay? Are other categories like Oral Care or whatever else kicking in to the China growth? Just more color on that market would be great. Thanks.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Sure. I'll make some comments on that. And we're very pleased with China. You know the trends. We talk to this at probably every investor conference, the minus 5% to plus 1% to plus 7%. We've improved across the majority of brands, and frankly the fourth quarter was very encouraging at plus 10%. And we've got six or seven categories that are growing or holding share. Baby's been the one exclusion, and it's turned in the fourth quarter to growing sales. And Baby in China started growing share in the hyper and online channels, which is critically important. And to me the breadth is strong. The fact that e-commerce, most of our brands now are holding or growing share, and in the hyper are growing share, is very encouraging to me.","Yes, SK-II and Olay were very important, and they grew. But again, it's broad-based. Fem Care grew 18%. We've had very strong growth now for two years on power Oral Care, and that's turning. Fabric Care was, I think, mid to high single digits recently. So businesses that have struggled in the past, the superiority investments and importantly the organizational change that puts on the ground capability is now getting this operating at a speed that is showing tremendous progress. I think we mentioned earlier, front half 6%, back half 8%, all trending in the direction we want. So I'm very encouraged by it. Jon?","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","And with that, just briefly, both before-tax and after-tax margins increasing year on year. So it's been a productive investment, and we expect that to continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Can you just, I guess, delve a little bit further into Grooming in terms of, I guess, what you were talking about on Harry's and what you're seeing? It did seem like there were some positive data points, or I guess you had talked about some positive data points, that maybe it had bottomed out intra-quarter. So have we seen the bottom? Are you seeing kind of increased competition as we move into the back half, and kind of how should we look at that over the next year?","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","A couple comments. The interventions we made last year clearly have made a difference, and you've seen that in the U.S. share results. The fact that they turned positive over the last three and six months is a strong indication. We've got our eyes, though, very wide open. Harry's is expanding distribution in Walmart. We expect continued competition online, both in the U.S. and now in several markets in Europe. However, this time we're being much more attentive to making sure we support the business online and offline, both in the U.S. and in Europe, and frankly across the world. And it's reflected at the total positive trends on Grooming share if you look globally and in the U.S.","I do, though, want to be very open about we expect the competitive environment to stay very heavy for a while, and the right actions would be get within pricing corridor, superior products, improve your in-store execution, and then we've stepped up our investment and capability online, both in U.S. and Europe. And most recently, we've been gaining new users at a faster rate than our competition the last couple months, even in the U.S.","So we understand and see the opportunity, and we're going to address in each market, online or offline, what it takes to grow, because we clearly have the superior products, we clearly have the ladder that gives us the tools to win. And now that we're putting innovation in disposables mid-tier in the premium tier, I think we're well-positioned now to grow this business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for letting me ask a question. I wanted to stick on the topic of diving a little bit deeper into just some of the segments. Profitability or margins were particularly soft in Baby and in Fem. I presume that's predominantly the input cost environment, hence the pricing. Can you confirm that? And then can you go a little deeper in Fabric and Home? I was surprised to see the margin degradation there, and I was also surprised to see the reference to investments in consumer and customer value, given the strong innovation you've had in that segment.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Thanks, Jason. You've just mentioned the three categories where the commodity cost impacts are the most significant, from both a pulp and energy basis on the paper businesses, and clearly from a petro-complex standpoint on the Fabric Care business. Those are also businesses where freight costs and delivery is a relatively high aspect of the cost structure, and as you know, the transportation market, particularly in the U.S., has presented us with some challenges as the year progressed.","So that is indeed \u2013 you rightly cite the reason why margins are compressed in those businesses. As we make moves, both from an innovation standpoint and a pricing standpoint, we expect to recover that margin. We did make some investments in Fabric Care in the U.S. in both customer value and consumer value, and that's really just designed to continue the momentum in that business and continue pushing that market. And business has responded very well, with volume up 6%, value also increasing, and so we're reasonably happy with those choices.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you guys could reconcile this dynamic of \u2013 Jon, to your point, P&G has very good margins, industry-leading margins. But at the same time you have a lot of competitors that are money-losing, and it almost seems like capital is unlimited out there right now for startups. So I'm just wondering how you guys internally think about that dynamic because it doesn't look like \u2013 or it doesn't feel like that trend is going to slow down anytime soon.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Well, I think, Nik \u2013 and Dave can comment on this as well \u2013 we've talked about the need to offer competitive value propositions across all price tiers that we choose to compete in, and that's versus multinational competitors. It's also versus local and regional competitors and startups. And we need to be more productive from a cost structure standpoint to do that and still generate the margins that we feel we need to earn. And so that's why we keep talking about the combination of three things. One is increasing advantage, which does allow us to price above the market at times; productivity, which funds the investments in advantage and also provides margin; and also consumer and customer value competitiveness. All three of those have to go together for us to win, whether that's versus a startup or an established multinational competitor.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","The only thing I'd add to that is what you say is very real. I mean, you face reality, there are some people coming into categories that are aggressively spending. What we're choosing to do is make sure we're being more competitive in protecting our businesses. And to me when we do that and leverage the tools that we have, I think we're in a good place to be able to sustain the appropriate support to build the brand over time. And that may call for us at some times, in some countries, and some brands to be more aggressive to make sure that we don't cede a good bit of market share when we truly have a better proposition for consumers and a sustainable proposition.","And I think that's one of the opportunities, if I look back over the last couple of years, is when the first (49:24) is a very substantive competitive threat, to make sure each category and each country addresses the appropriate action. And that'll look very different depending on the category, the country, and the competitor. But clearly we believe that the combination of these five elements of superiority positions us well to be able to sustain both share and margin growth over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. So I hate to belabor the pricing point. You guys mentioned progress in a number of areas in the last fiscal year ex organic sales, but margins and profit ended up being disappointing. I think you were only up 1% year over year. You'd originally expected 5% to 6%. I get that commodities ran up, so I'm not necessarily looking to go back through that. But what's surprising is when there is large commodity pressure you're also seeing negative pricing, and the pricing decelerated throughout the year. It doesn't sound like we should expect much recovery of that in fiscal 2019, and perhaps even commodity pressures above pricing yet again.","So I'm just trying to understand the forward-looking strategy at a very high level, perhaps taking advantage of your presence on the call, David. Is this lack of pricing power just sort of more the reality of the marketplace now with the retailer pushback, a competitive branded competitor environment, private label pressure, et cetera? Is it more of a purposeful choice in your minds to drive P&G market share, as you articulated, and hopefully reinvigorate organic sales growth? I'm just sort of wondering, is this a new normal going forward where we shouldn't expect much pricing from P&G, and how you think about that at a very high level.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Yeah. First, no, I do not think that the new normal is we don't have pricing power, at all. What I do believe is it varies by category when you take pricing and how much you take pricing. It is not unusual in several categories \u2013 so if I take the one that we announced yesterday on tissue-towel. It's not unusual for the industry to wait until the commodity costs build up to a certain level to be able to take pricing; then there's a threshold, you take it, and you do recover.","If you look over time, over three, five years in many of these industries \u2013 and I've got a lot of familiarity with the tissue-towel industry \u2013 we've been able to recover those costs. And do I see anything fundamentally changing that tells me we could not recover those costs well? Not at all. I believe superior products at competitive prices will win, and I believe in time the industry has to address input costs. And it just sometimes doesn't happen in the first three to six months that you see those.","The other thing that I very much believe is, when executed well, superior products command premium pricing. And we've got excellent examples of that, whether that's China or the U.S. And, again, it just causes us to have to up our game on the level of superiority, and it has to up our game on the productivity in the periods of time we have to bridge costs going up before we're able to address that, either with innovation or with pricing.","But we do not accept that we've lost pricing power. We do not accept that any category doesn't have the responsibility over time to grow. But it's the over time, and there'll be smart times to do it. And we learned a lot from two or three years ago when we may have been too aggressive trying to recover and got ahead of the market. But over time, very committed to deliver the sustainable margin growth and sales and share growth that I think our investors expect of us.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Just to \u2013 David \u2013 follow up on that. And you mentioned over time want to focus on 2019 as time and get a sense of your confidence in the guidance. First, in terms of the acceleration in top line of 2% to 3% organic sales, what does that assume in terms of price\/mix versus volume? Is it more kind of \"Marlboro Friday,\" \"Tide Thursday\" type pricing and couponing, so price\/mix there? And then the 2% to 3% top line turns into a pretty wide range of EPS at the 3% to 8%. That suggests, obviously, a large range on margins.","I understand all the uncertainties, but want to understand how much those uncertainties are macro uncertainties versus competitive or consumer uncertainties. So to understand the flexibility you need there. And then lastly \u2013 and don't take this the wrong way, but do you consider \u2013 did you consider \u2013 not giving guidance at all, particularly given some of the transformation you're going through, the fact that it's back-half weighted again, and what you've admitted to be a lot of uncertainties in the marketplace?","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","So let me take that one, and David can jump in. First of all, the relationship between volume and price and the top line guidance estimate, Ali, as I mentioned, we expect over the total fiscal year basis, the organic sales growth to be volume driven. So volume will drive most of that. I also mentioned in the prepared remarks that pricing will be a negative impact on the top line for the first half or so, and then become positive in the second half. So the relationship between volume and price will evolve as the year progresses.","Even the price increases that we've talked today don't become effective until close to the end of the calendar year \u2013 actually one of them in October, and I think the other in February. So we're going to continue to see for the next couple quarters some price degradation. But as pricing is implemented in the marketplace, we should see that situation reverse itself.","Relative to the bottom line guidance, I think you said it very well. And David talked about it in his remarks. We're operating in a very dynamic environment. We try to reflect that reality in terms of the width of the range. The combination of foreign exchange, currency, the real uncertainty associated with trade and the political environment, and even the potential spillover into consumer purchase choices, it's just a very dynamic time. And I think there are opportunities within that, which is why the high end of the guidance range reflects a meaningful progress, but there are also challenges within that. So we're just trying to be representative of the reality that we see as we sit here today.","And generally we feel we have a responsibility to give investors an indication of in fact what we see in front of us and what we're working towards. And as you know we've moved away from two things relative to guidance over time. One is quarterly guidance, which we don't provide. So this is just a fiscal year slice. And we've also moved away from a lot of guidance on the internals in terms of individual margin components, for example, because with currency and commodities, those move all over the place. I will manage that but we don't need to distract you with that. So that's kind of how we're thinking about the guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to focus again on price. I mean, the environment, whether it's macro, retail, has changed pretty considerably since the last time you guys needed to push through price. So it would be great if you could talk about the different ways you can try and realize price this time around, beyond just the diapers and tissue-towel that you mentioned. Are there other categories you're looking at? Have the levers changed? Do you think about not only straight list, but also reducing ounces in the tube or bottle or package count, which I assume was what you're doing in diapers and tissue-towel? And are there other areas, whether it be concessions for fuller truck loads, the focus on premium end? Just am trying to understand the potential leverage you may have to push through top line improvement and how that compares in developed versus emerging markets and how much volume you'd be willing to sacrifice in order to get price? Thanks.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Sure. Let me make just a few comments on that, because we absolutely have many tools to address price. Certainly there's straight list prices, and we've got some that we just announced. The majority of times we do pricing, it's coupled with innovations. So the consumer value can actually improve, but the higher price, you can recover cost to commodities. We've done that for years in many of our businesses and done it successfully. Again, the timing may not line up perfectly with the input cost increase.","We've done a lot of resizing when we think that works well and helps keep a critical price point. We've done a number with new pack sizes. We certainly can use innovations with new forms to create new price points and price expectations. There's also the tool of promotional spending, and again that varies widely by country, where it can often be a de-escalation of promotional spending is a way to get average price up, and again depending on the market dynamics can be a smart choice.","One of the reasons we're trying to put more decision space into markets where appropriate is that they can be a little more agile. And if you take U.S. and China as the two probably best illustrations, what we want is each category to understand exactly what's required to grow both their sales, their top line, and their bottom line over time, and they'll have the appropriate strategy then to address what tool in the pricing toolbox to address that over time.","And again I think that China is probably the most successful. The last two years we've seen sales growth, share trends moving very much in the right direction, and at the same time, as Jon mentioned, the structural financials have improved, and it's largely been superiority driven, supported by a lot of cost savings that allowed us to invest in the demand creation, as well as a lot of productivity to make sure the money we spent is very efficiently spent.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Yeah, I would just add one tool to the arsenal, which will be familiar to you, and that's just being as \u2013 and David referred to this \u2013 as productive as we can across the cost structure so that we have the flexibility to adjust when competitive realities dictate that we do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Stephen Powers - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. So, David, last quarter you described things as not business as usual at P&G, underscoring the need to deliver more balanced top and bottom line progress and really issuing at least what I heard as an incremental call to action. But this quarter, on what seemed like pretty similar results to me at least, you seem a lot more upbeat. So I guess my question is what's driven the change in tone?","And I definitely see that the market share trends at retail have improved, but it's obviously still coming at a cost. So just a little bit more expansion on why you believe future results will be more balanced. And I agree the volume and the market share trends are impressive. But to Lauren's initial question, as you pull back on the promotions and the couponing over the course of fiscal 2019, what gives you confidence that the volume and share momentum can be sustained?","And if I could tack on a related point, maybe, just with regards to your SG&A efficiency this quarter, if you annualize the lower SG&A versus consensus expectations, it's like a $1 billion positive GAAP on a full year, and that's an amazing run rate if it's sustainable. But I guess the risk that I'm grappling with is, in pulling back so dramatically, is there a risk that you're jeopardizing long-term business health by cutting back on important investment? And I know you've said you're not, but the gap is just so sizable, I feel compelled to ask the question. So thanks a lot.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","All right. Steve, let me take the first part of that question and then ask Jon to cover some of the specifics on the SG&A efficiency and the annualization question that you have.","Again, my comments and certainly the optimistic view going forward, it is underpinned heavily by the share growth and the fact that many of the things we've been working on over time to get the proposition \u2013 the total proposition \u2013 we talked of five elements. Those don't happen immediately, and they don't happen on every brand in every country. As more are falling in place, we're seeing things to me that are very positive. The global value share trends over the last two years are getting better and better, and just recently turned positive. It's the first time this year, last year, where the total company in June was positive, driven by strong North America growth.","Go back two years ago, we said we had to fix U.S. and China. We had to address a number of key categories. Each of those sequentially is getting better. U.S. share meaningfully better, from losing 0.3 [percentage points] to losing 0.1 to flat, to past three months plus 0.3, past month plus 0.6, and it's driven by the right things. It's driven by products and packages and better and more efficient communication. That I think is sustainable. And what is happening now, and the phasing does affect certainly quarters, is recovering a lot of the input cost and T&W cost, transportation and warehousing cost, has taken time. And, yes, the competitive environment is very difficult, which is why we've said we're not business as usual. We know we have to take more cost out, and that's why we're doubling down and looking to accelerate many of the cost savings that we've planned over several years into tighter time frames. That's being worked.","We don't disclose everything, but clearly accelerating productivity, put smart investments in the right area of the superiority, and recovering cost when it makes sense with the right tool and pricing does give me confidence. And the fact that the consumers are voting for us more and more often, volume growth is strong, we're seeing many of the brands' household penetration start to move, and then you see China, India \u2013 we didn't talk a lot about \u2013 double digit, and the outlook is very strong. And if you're starting to get the U.S. growing, you get China growing, India, Europe has had solid growth, you start to feel you've got more and more of the key countries that drive profit and share and volume positive. And for that reason I think we can double down, but we need to do it faster. And we need an organization that owns outcomes in each market, and that's what we're building.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","And relative to SG&A, going back to the importance of balanced top and bottom line growth, which we feel very strongly about, it wouldn't make sense to dial back on support for brand creation and the spending behind that, and we haven't done that. So media, for example, was up 4% in the quarter, even as we faced a very difficult year with lots of cost increases in the balance of the business. You wouldn't see the volume and consumption trends that you're seeing if we weren't continuing to support the business at relatively high levels. So the commitment to grow that top line and through the productivity efforts that David mentioned and the innovation efforts, which build margin, continue to build the bottom line, it remains fully present.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you; good morning. I just had a quick follow-on question regarding the pricing. Just hoping to hear more from you on what the retailers' response has been to the price increases that you've announced, and how have these increases possibly changed your different price gaps? And then a question on innovation. If you look back at your fiscal 2018, how would you characterize your pace of innovation and how successful it was, especially in the context of the organic sales growth? Did it meet your expectations? And then as you look forward into fiscal 2019, could you touch on your innovation pipeline and how different it may be from last year? Will there be more and\/or will the innovation be more breakthrough type of innovation? Thanks.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Okay. There's many questions in there. The first one is difficult to answer in that we don't talk specific retailer reactions other than if you step back and look at the industry, we're all pressed to recover cost. Transportation and warehousing costs are experienced not only by manufacturers but by retailers. And so I believe broadly, as long as it is cost-justified and\/or innovation provides meaningfully new benefits, I believe retailers will work with us. And I think generally the industry has to recover a rising input cost. All participants are experiencing this all over the world. So that's all I really can say. I won't talk about individual retailers, and the one we've just announced today we're just announcing today, so I don't have any data there. And generally if I look around the world, not just the U.S., generally I believe when you have innovation and\/or there's an environment that it's justified, we've been able to get pricing. And so that's all I'll comment on that.","In terms of the pace of innovation, it has increased in terms of the impact, and that's what we really want is this magnitude of superiority. And if I take just the one example that we've talked many times, but it matters, is things like the scent beads. Growing that faster, moving it from a $250 million business to a $500 million business, adds real, profitable sales to the company. And we are driving those faster and harder, and driving things like household penetration, which is more users. Those are the most profitable additional cases you can get, because you've already got a sizable business, and you're leveraging the assets you've employed.","We want more innovations, and what we're working on is more meaningful innovations. We learned a lot, if I go back several years ago, with over-proliferating very minor extensions. What we want is meaningful, consumer-significant innovations, and where smart, differentiated solutions that help our retailers. And we'll work with them as well. And that's an area I expect we'll do more going forward, because the combination of those two addresses the consumer and customer value, and that's a key part of our superiority strategy.","Pipeline, I believe, is very strong. And the fact that we put additional effort into our upstream innovation several years ago, those will come out over time. And both Jon and I have mentioned that we have many tests going on to continue to make sure that we learn fast and then bring to the market consumer-meaningful innovation that will grow category size, which helps both us and our retailers.","Operator","Next we'll go to Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph N. Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess I just wanted to dig in a little more into your 2% to 3% organic sales growth outlook and from a different direction. What are you guys assuming in terms of the overall market growth rate for this year? And I assume, if it's still in that similar 2% to 3% range, with trade inventory reduction reductions still a modest headwind likely, I'm trying to understand how much in the way of market share gains you're assuming, or does that imply, in terms of your organic growth rate for this year. Thanks.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Okay. Just a comment on the 2% to 3%, and I may need to get last part of your question \u2013 I wasn't sure I got it. The 2% to 3%, as far as market growth, it is in the, still the 2% to 3%. And understand, we have to grow a little faster because consumption tends to be ahead of what we experience because there have been inventories that have come down across the world as e-commerce grows, especially in the big, major markets. And I'm not seeing anything dramatically different. We'll see what happens in places where there's pricing, the benefit of pricing versus the impact on the consumer with volume. But right now to me the market is pretty steady.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","So we should \u2013 with the dynamics that David mentioned, if we grow organic sales 2% to 3%, we should be building share against our current assumption of market growth, because consumption will be slightly higher than that.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning. Thanks very much. You cited \u2013 real quick one \u2013 you cited 120 basis points of mix factors within your gross margin buildup, mix and other factors. I'm assuming, the way you wrote that, that's mostly mix. And could you \u2013 I know you're not going to guide on that, but could you give us a sense what the single largest buckets are of negative gross margin mix and maybe if there's a big positive one in there that's offsetting and what you're thinking about for 2019 as far as gross margin mix as a contributor based on current trends? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","So I'll give you two examples of what are driving mix, one of which will hopefully reverse itself, the other will hopefully not, and I'll explain that. One example of negative mix is the decline year on year in sales in blades and razors, which is one of our most profitable businesses. So as that business grows at a lower rate or declines \u2013 or grows at lower rate than the balance of the business, that generates a negative gross margin mix hurt. That, I hope, resolves itself as we continue to strengthen results in that business.","Another example that might be somewhat counterintuitive \u2013 and tongue in cheek, I hope it doesn't resolve itself \u2013 is when you grow a premium-priced item \u2013 David mentioned beads, for example \u2013 at a rate that's faster than the balance of the business, those items \u2013 and both Tide PODS unit dose and fabric enhancer beads are examples of this \u2013 have a higher price. They have a significantly higher penny profit, typically dollars higher than comparable items, but the combination of those yields mathematically a lower margin, meaning that when you sell more of those products, your gross margin declines. But it's a very good day, and we want to sell as many of those items as we can. So John can help you offline kind of tease out those components, but those are two of the largest drivers in the quarter that we've just completed, for example.","Operator","And next we'll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. Wanted to ask about where retailers are in increasing focus on private label. Less so as it kind of your relates to your ability to price and more to do with how brand-new companies compete when retailers seem to want to put more private label on shelves. An example of this would be your reductions in shaving and razor prices a year ago with a large wholesale club coming out with its own private label about a year after those reductions. And just sort of related to that, where do you believe your current shelf space is a year from now or so relative to current levels?","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Just a couple of comments on that. First, we've experienced retailers putting varying levels of focus on their retailer brand, private label. And we understand for most retailers it's an important part of their strategy, both from an equity standpoint and a margin revenue standpoint. We've also shown over time \u2013 and probably Europe is the best illustration, because it's most advanced there \u2013 the ability to win in that environment, where the leading brand and the retailer brand can mutually be successful.","And it comes back to the same point. What you have to have is the brand consumers prefer, because then retailers want to carry it, because it builds the basket. And, yes, they will continue to put emphasis and at times add shelf space. And if we're doing our job and have the innovation, it comes at the expense of somebody else. It's one of the reasons you have to watch in the middle without a distinctive positioning in a brand that's meaningfully different to consumers. It is the reason why we believe that I think retailers will continue to put more emphasis, in many of the cases, on the retailer brands and we can accelerate our growth. But it means the advantages has to be enough that the consumer that's interested in the retailer brand is not the consumer that typically buys our brands. And when we really do our job, we're able to source from a variety of sources, but frankly usually it's the brands and the weaker businesses in the middle. So that part I think is still true.","I don't believe the \u2013 you'll see a spike when a retailer makes a new push in either a category or broadly into retailer brands. But, again, we've seen this over time \u2013 Europe is the best illustration, but the same is true in the U.S., where there may be a spike and then it steadies out with what the consumer wants. And they will follow the shopper just as we do. And our job is to make sure more shoppers pick our brands.","I believe we can earn shelf space over time with innovation, and that's certainly been our experience. You better be enough different. And, again, it's especially, to me, successful when you bring meaningful difference or a new form to the consumer or a new benefit area. It's one of the reasons PODS and beads have been able to grow both share, sales, profit, and space in most cases, because the retailer wants to feature it for the reason Jon mentioned, for us and for them, because the penny profit's higher for them, and to me, the absolute sales and total profit for us. And the consumer gets a product that's meaningfully better.","And that's a good example of superiority in place, and shelf space can be earned. And frankly the expectation I'd have for each of our businesses is they need to have propositions that are able to earn shelf space from the retail partners because it's in their best interest.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So following up on pricing, are you going to continue to increase the gap between your own price points? And you just positioned Luvs diapers cheaper before, and now with the announced price increase in Pampers, should we expect the price realization gaps in between those two brands to continue to widen? And the same for Bounty and Charmin brands, I guess these brands own (1:17:04) basic and essential value extensions, basically going back to the point about private label as you mentioned in the last few quarters. And in the long run, should we continue to see P&G use high-low strategies with the premium products funding price reductions in the key categories, as happened in Grooming and now in diapers? Thank you.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Okay. Just a couple comments on the pricing. Bounty and Charmin are pricing to recover the cost increases we and rest of the industry participants are experiencing. We have, for each of our brands and for each of our tiers, desired pricing corridors that we know the consumers believe provides good value. Over time, we'll take the actions that make sure we address that.","I believe in many of the categories where we're taking pricing on our premium brands, there is pressure for all participants to understand what they think is right to deal with the rise in input costs. We'll have to respond to whatever each of the competitors choose, and we'll do so. And, again, we've learned very clearly what is the pricing corridor where we can grow share over time. We also know that we increase the margin of superiority, we often can grow that price point. And that, again, is one of the reasons why we're doubling down on the superiority.","I believe, and again, we've gone through times where input costs went up significantly, where we've priced and we were able to build our business. And if something happens with another retailer that causes an issue \u2013 or rather another competitor \u2013 we'll have to be agile in each market, and we'll do so.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon R. Andersen - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for the question. I want to ask about e-commerce. Sorry if I missed it, but what percent of the total company sales were e-commerce related in fiscal 2018? How would you characterize your major brand market shares online versus offline at present? And also if you could talk briefly about margins, offline, online, where you stand today, and what some of the opportunities are ahead to improve that. Thank you.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","Sure. First, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in our total e-commerce business, led primarily by the two biggest, been U.S. and China, but also Europe as well and in other markets, Korea very strong. We're winning online with 30% growth this year. We're up to $4.5 billion (1:19:20) and in total, to answer specifically your question, it's about 7% of our global sales.","And the other point I'd make generally, it varies widely by country and category, but our market shares and our margins online are roughly equal to offline. And for that reason we \u2013 and we want to keep it that way as best we can, because we're channel agnostic. We can go wherever the shopper wants to go and have our brands available. And then we work the cost structure and certainly our productivity programs to ensure we can do that. But again, that varies widely by category and country because we have to deal with whatever the competitive set is in that category and country. But broadly, 7% global sales and markets, shares, and margins roughly equal.","Operator","And next we'll go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies LLC","Thanks; good morning. First a housekeeping question if I can. Jon, so the tax rate guidance for fiscal 2019 at 19% to 20%. Is that permanently lower, and if so what's driving it? Is that also reflective of the cash tax rate?","And then, David, the broader question on the Beauty and natural space. And you touched on the three tuck-in deals that you've transacted on so far this year, small but add to brands like Olay and SK-II. Can you compare and contrast the approach here, maybe versus past mistakes that Procter has made in the beauty space? Maybe how you'll integrate these differently, maybe let them sort of operate on a standalone basis? Views of managing the number of brands in the portfolio? The company obviously went through a period of rationalizing the portfolio and reducing the number of brands. Maybe talk about that now as you sort of enter back into more active M&A. And maybe touch on the pipeline a bit and broadly what can we expect going forward. Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","Okay. First on the taxes. Based on everything we know today, which will change tomorrow, we'd expect 19% to 20% to be a good estimate of a going tax rate, probably closer to 20% than 19%, Kevin. The cash tax rates, if you consider the cash that we're paying on the repatriation tax, which has already been recognized as a one-time charge to earnings, inclusive of that would be a little bit higher, but not significantly.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","I'll give just some comments on naturals. First, we're quite committed to winning there. And while, yes, I will talk a minute bit about the acquisitions, to me the biggest part of the growth is coming from organic innovation from our existing brands. I mentioned almost every brand now has deeply understood that consumer. And what they've been working \u2013 and the reason it's taken time in some of the cases is we want to solve the trade-off between often the \u2013 either free-of or full-of, depending on how it's expressed in each market benefit, as well as with the core functional benefit of the category. And the ones I mentioned at least, whether it's Tide purclean or Gain, Febreze ONE, Whisper Pure Cotton, and recently Pampers Pure Protection, all of these are showing very good growth in the market because they're addressing the consumer need.","And, yes, we will supplement when we see an opportunity that gives us either people capabilities or a key brand that we think we can turn from a small brand into a bigger brand and grow over time. How I'd contrast this with potentially the past is we're not looking to proliferate a ton of brands and we want a huge number of small brands. What we want to do is grow our big brands, and we believe it's very important that we plant seeds in high-growth areas, either organically or through acquisition, and make them bigger brands by bringing our capability be it product, package technology, communication, and\/or supply chain, which often is what enables you to turn these brands from small, unprofitable brands to mid-sized to bigger profitable businesses. And that's exciting, because almost every category, there is a meaningful consumer segment, and it is growing fast. And now we've got our organic innovation coming in the market and supplements.","And then the last thing, you asked what are we doing on the ones that we have purchased, is at this time we are leaving them where they are right down and giving them time. We want to learn from them and then make available the capabilities that P&G has without imposing anything that would slow down the rate of growth or our rate of learning. And to me, I'm quite excited about what we're learning from Native and Snowberry, and what we will learn from First Aid Beauty, and frankly what we'll learn from our healthcare acquisition, because we have talent coming in, and we have products and brands that we think are catalysts for accelerated growth.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Two quick questions on the portfolio. First with Fabric Care. Can you speak, Jon, a little bit more about the acuteness of where we saw the price\/mix investments and what catalyzed the behavior? And should this be a trend that was contained to the fourth quarter, or should we expect it to linger on through fiscal 2019? And then for the second part, I can appreciate that there's a number of different items happening in Grooming right now competitively. But all in, should we expect revenues for that business segment to be down in fiscal 2019? Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Procter & Gamble Co.","So on laundry in the U.S., we made several investments to deliver price competitiveness consistent with the comment David made earlier about maintaining pricing within proven quarters for growth. And you saw that generate some solid growth. Where we go from here will depend a lot on the competitive environment. We want to drive as much top line revenue as possible, but we know we need to be price competitive to do that sustainably.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","And the other, we don't give guidance by business, but no, I have not accepted and we have not accepted that any of our core categories are not going to grow in fiscal 2019. We'll have to deal with what happens in each market, and for Grooming, our aspiration is to grow that business. And we're putting the innovation and plans in place just to do just that.","David S. Taylor - Procter & Gamble Co.","I think that wraps up the call. Thank you very much. We appreciate the questions. And again, I'd just close with we're quite committed to making the changes, and the strategy to me is showing the right signs in terms of positive share trends, and we're quite committed to delivering balanced top and bottom line growth.

Good afternoon. We\u2019re going to keep prepared remarks on the short side today, reflecting a fairly straight forward quarter, our recent Investor Day and the CAGNY conference coming up in just a couple of weeks. We'll share result headlines, comment briefly on strategic focus areas, update guidance for the fiscal year and then open the call for your questions.","So, getting right to it, we delivered a strong organic sales -- we delivered strong organic sales growth in the October December quarter, putting us ahead of fiscal year targets. Organic sales grew 4%, driven by volume, pricing and mix. 8 out of 10 global categories grew organic sales, Skin and Personal care in the teens, Fabric Care and Feminine Care high singles, Family Care, Oral Care and Personal Health Care mid-single digits. Each of our top 15 markets grew organic sales with China up 15%, India up 16%, and Japan up 9%. E-commerce organic sales grew nearly 30%.","Our naturals entry continued to drive growth including Pampers Pure Protection diapers, Burt's Bees toothpaste, and Native deodorants, which we recently expanded in the Target stores. We\u2019ve built aggregate market share. 34 of our top 50 country category combinations held or grew value share, up from 26 last fiscal year, 23 in fiscal \u201817, and 17 in fiscal \u201816. Within this strong sequential and absolute progress, we continue to have some challenges. Grooming organic sales were down low singles. Global Baby Care trends improved but with organic sales only at the level of the prior year. In total though, consumption volume, sales and share are each progressing nicely.","We also delivered strong constant currency earnings growth. Core earnings per share was $1.25, up 5% versus the prior year. Within this, foreign exchange was a $200 million after-tax earnings headwind, about $0.09 per share. So, on a constant currency basis, core earnings per share, up 13%. Gross and operating margins improved sequentially, as expected, net strong underlying earnings progress. Cash flow also remained strong with $4 billion in operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity of 103%. $2.6 billion of cash was returned to shareowners, $750 million of share repurchase and $1.9 billion of dividend.","We completed the acquisition of the Merck KGaA OTC assets, significantly enhancing our international presence in personal health care. We also acquired Walker & Company with products designed to serve the unique needs of consumers of color.","In summary, a strong quarter, solid consumption volume and organic sales growth, driving positive market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong constant currency core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareowners. All delivered while working to address some category specific challenges and against a very difficult competitive and macro landscape.","We continue to accelerate change through our program of constructive disruption to meet the remaining challenges we face and to further improve results. Our strategic focus areas remain constant. We\u2019ve made a deliberate choice to invest, as you know, in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing and value, not just in the premium tier, but in each price tier where we compete, strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands.","We\u2019re making solid progress on extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of our execution, which show in our results, as I mentioned earlier, sequential share progress over multiple years. Additional investment will be needed to continue this progress. The need for this investment, the need to offset macro cost headwinds, and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion, underscores the continued importance of productivity.","We are continuing cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business, approaching the midpoint of our second five-year $10 billion productivity program. We\u2019ve consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. We\u2019re eliminating substantial waste in the media supply chain, delivering nearly $1 billion of savings in agency fees and ad production costs over the last four years. We see more savings potential in these areas along with more efficiency in media delivery.","We\u2019re continuing to drive savings and organization cost. Total enrollment is down nearly 30% since the start of our first productivity program, about 35%, when including contractor role elimination.","P&G is a highly profitable company. Before tax operating margins are among the highest in the industry, behind only Reckitt and Colgate, whose margins reflect their concentrations in health care. We have significant below the line advantages, operating with one of the lowest interest expense percentages and one of the lowest tax rates, putting us near the top of the industry in after-tax margin, already highly profitable and aggressively driving more savings.","We\u2019re also focused on cash productivity, with significant progress in all areas of working capital. Over the past five years, we have improved receivables by 3 days, inventory by 10 days and payables by more than 30 days, enabling us to fund capital spending needed to transform our global supply chain.","Over the last seven fiscal years, we have averaged nearly 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity and have returned an average of over a 110% of reported net earnings to share owners through dividends and share repurchase.","We\u2019re making organization structure and culture changes to strengthen our position to win. We\u2019re taking steps to simplify the organization structure, focus clarify responsibility, and increase accountability. We\u2019re supplementing internal talent development with experienced external hiring, and we\u2019re building category dedication and mastery.","We\u2019re strengthening compensation and incentive programs. As we discussed in detail at our Investor Day, we\u2019re moving to a new organization structure to further dematrix the Company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability.","We\u2019re significantly reducing the level of corporate resources, moving about 60% of corporate roles to the business units and markets. At the same time, we\u2019re leading the constructive disruption of our industry; lean innovation processes to improve speed to market, shots on goal, and success rates of new products; monetizing internally developed technologies to build value and fund even more innovation investment; disruption the brand building ecosystem with digitally-enabled to one-to-one mass marketing; supply chain transformation enabled by robotic process automation; and leveraging digitization and data analytics to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness of all facets of our operation. We are creating a more engaged, agile and accountable organization, operating at a lower cost, focused on winning through superiority, fueled by productivity, working at the speed of the market. We\u2019re working urgently to sustain our near-term momentum and to position P&G to win over the mid and long-term.","Moving to guidance. Having delivered a strong first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019re increasing the high-end of the organic sales growth range by a point, making the new growth range 2% to 4%. We have strong innovation and support plans for the back half of the year. Gillette SkinGuard in the U.S. and Europe; upgrades to Tide and Ariel unit dose PODS in North America, Europe and Japan; expansion of Crest and Oral-B Gum Detoxify toothpaste to Latin America; continue the support of Vicks VapoCOOL, NyQuil, DayQuil and Cough Drops through the cold and flu season; Pantene Rose Water Sulfate-Free Shampoo and Conditioner; formula and packaging upgrades on Head & Shoulders; new Olay Vitality masks and creams in China; upgrade on Pampers Cruisers and continued strong support behind the range of Always Whisper Tampax and Always the Discreet innovations we've watched recently around the world.","We're innovating and investing to maintain top-line momentum, but we're also realistic about the market and competitive dynamics that will impact us in the back half of the fiscal year. Pricing should remain positive in the back half, but this will increase volume uncertainty and volatility. We face highly capable competitors with strong plans of their own; macro uncertainty stemming from issues like Brexit, a crisis of consumer confidence in France, and trade and other policy impacts that can impact both the top and bottom-line. Our efforts and results fiscal year-to-date and the totality of these tailwinds and headwinds leave us comfortable increasing our organic sales guidance, albeit within a relatively wide range.","We now expect all-in sales growth in the range of down 1% of top 1% versus last year, reflecting 3 to 4 negative points from foreign exchange. We're maintaining core earnings per share guidance for 3% to 8%, having delivered about 4% fiscal year-to-date. The combination of stronger than expected organic sales growth and productivity-driven cost savings are offsetting a significantly larger challenge from foreign exchange and commodity costs than we originally anticipated.","Our fiscal year earnings outlook includes a potential gain on the sale of land at our Gillette side of Boston. The land sale, if it occurs this fiscal, will likely contribute around a point of earnings per share growth for the year. We're currently forecasting a foreign exchange headwind on earnings of about $900 million after-tax. Commodity costs are expected to be a $400 million headwind and trucking costs will likely be up 25% or more versus last year's levels. Combined, FX, commodities and transportation are nearly a $1.4 billion after-tax headwind, $0.53 per share.","As commodity prices and the foreign exchange rates move, we will take pricing when the degree of cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. There will be top-line volatility with these pricing moves. Competition may attempt to take advantage of our moves for short-term market share gains. Overall category consumption may be negatively impacted. We'll have to adjust as we go and as we learn. In any scenario, we'll aim to protect superiority building, value accretive investments in the business. We won't allow short-term pressures to derail the progress we're making towards sustained, profitable top-line growth.","Our outlook for items below the operating line is unchanged. We now expect to exceed our target of 90% adjusted free cash flow productivity. This includes CapEx in the range of 5% to 5.5%.","There'll be another year of strong cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase up to $5 billion of shares in fiscal 2019. This share repurchase range factors in the cash required to complete the acquisition of Merck's OTC business and other transactions.","Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance.","To sum up, the external environment presents many challenges. To address these challenges and further strengthen results, we continue to accelerate the pace of change. Efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability to constructively disrupt our industry are and will continue driving improved results and will help us achieve our objective of consistently and sustainably growing sales, margin and cash.","With that, I'm happy to turn to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about China up 15%, I think is a lot stronger than most of us were expecting? Could you comment specifically on SK-II and Olay in China and how they did in the quarter? And what your outlook is for the next -- for the second half? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Wendy. It's been a strong first half and the second quarter in China. If you look at annually the organic sales progression in China going back three years, then minus 5, plus 1, plus 7 last year and plus 9 for the first half this year; and as you indicated, above that rate in the second quarter. We do not see a sign at this point of slowdown of the consumer in China, as witnessed by those results. Market growth rates continue to be relatively strong. Within China, just like the balance of the business, we have our successes and our challenges SK-II and Olay are obviously in the success column with Skin Care, both SK-II and Olaygrowing strong double-digits for several consecutive quarters.0","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in so early. I appreciate it. Two questions for you. First, the change on the $1.32 billion to $1.4 billion drag on earnings from cost pressure and currency. I think the $900 million you gave on currency is the same as what you gave last quarter. The $400 million on commodities looks to be the same. So, it sounds like the bulk -- you obviously put a lot of focus on freight. Is freight the incremental driver? And if so, why -- kind of what changed, because it seems to contrast with what we\u2019ve seen of a bit of an abatement of something like cost pressure?","That\u2019s question one. And question two, another source of strength, and by the way congratulations on the broad-based momentum. Laundry\u2019s acceleration has been impressive. You had a key competitor earlier this week announce plans for a lot of reinvestment. Can you talk about your own investment plans going forward and how you sustain the momentum in the face of what may be a more disruptive competition? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","I think, you\u2019re exactly right, Jason, in terms of your interpretation of the drivers of the 1.3 moving to 1.4 in terms of headwind, and that is ongoing premiums and transportation cost. And I think, the situation has exacerbated a little bit simply by the strength of the business and the demand that we\u2019re placing on that transportation system and it\u2019s just reflective of what we see. We\u2019re managing that I think well and putting steps in place, systems in place that should reduce that burden going forward. But, for the balance of this fiscal year, that\u2019s what we\u2019re currently seeing.","Our laundry business is doing, as you mentioned, extraordinarily well, had a really great quarter and great first half. And it\u2019s really the poster child in many ways for the strategy that we\u2019re working against, which is performance superiority along with packaging, communication and store execution and value, all working for us in that business with things like unit dose detergents, which continue to increase household penetration and market share. Our share within that segment, as you know, is very high, 80ish percent. Items like the fabric enhancer beads growing double-digits; that\u2019s a premium priced item, all of that driving category growth, which is extraordinarily important for both us and our retail partners, and within that ourselves building share as we\u2019ll do if we are the drivers of category growth. Doing that, through increased investment facilitated by productivity improvement, it\u2019s just as I said, kind of a poster child for the strategy that we\u2019re working against.","Henkel and Persil have been strong competitor. If I just focus on the U.S., Persil remains a 2 to 3 value share. We don\u2019t expect competition to stand still. And going back to the strategy, that is what fuels our deliberate choice amongst other things to invest in the five vectors of superiority, always working to improve those and strengthen the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands.","We continue to innovate across our Fabric Care lineup; we\u2019ve got a strong spring bundle that we\u2019ll introduce to the U.S. markets in the upcoming quarter. That includes Tide POD upgrades with improved film for better dissolution and perfume upgrades as well as two new scents, also innovating in the liquid space with heavy duty 10x liquid, introducing products and new benefit spaces, Studio Delicates by Tide and Tide antibacterial spray, and there\u2019ll be upgrades on Gain both liquids and flings as well. So, our competition is not standing still, nor are we.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So, in the guidance for the year, it certainly seems like you're anticipating, with the risk of a slowdown, a top-line growth. Are you actually seeing anything yet to support that caution? Are you seeing competitive shifts? I mean, certainly you\u2019ve heard from Henkel from a moment ago and before. But are you seeing competitive shifts, are you seeing merchandising or inventory shifts at retailers? And importantly, are you seeing any fatigue with trade-up among the consumers at this point in the economic cycle, and then how sustainable you think that is?","And then, within that, this 4% organic growth number, which you continue to deliver on strongly, is anyway to segregate that a little bit in terms of what is same-store sales sort to speak versus new shelf space, new product launches, you mentioned Native and Target, those types of things, just to give us a sense of new versus old in terms of the growth? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","So, as it relates to the guidance range, I mean, the move here is a positive move, reflecting more confidence in the business, not a negative move. So, we're increasing the top-line -- the top-end of the top-line guidance range, as you know from 3% to 4%. And we wouldn't be doing that, if we had obvious knowable issues that were confronting us today and didn't have the confidence to potentially overcome them. Having said that, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, the level of volatility and uncertainty that exists across multiple factors which are out of our control, which impact our business, as you mentioned competitive behavior, which we expect will be strong and response to our share gains, but even more importantly, the macroeconomic dynamics and the significant uncertainty that's introduced into the equation when we start moving price significantly, as we've all seen in previous cycles. So, it expressed increased confidence, not decreased confidence, but with an open eye reality to the volatility of the world that we live in and with the belief that it is too early to declare victory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Hey, Jon. I focus on Grooming. It's a difficult business to assess the health of from the outside. Clearly, it was a big driver of strength in the first quarter. You had a drag here in the second quarter. And I know promotional timing and quarter-to-quarter mix just tends to be more-lumpy in that business. But, as you think about the full-year and the momentum in that business, is the first half run rate indicative of what roughly you expect over the full-year, or do you feel as though the second half can show improved momentum off that first half run rate, given initiatives that that business has underway? I\u2019m just trying to understand how you feel kind of red light, green light, yellow light on Grooming, generally? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Steve. I apologize. I fell into my usual trap and neglected a few of Ali\u2019s questions. So, I want to go back to those and come back, Steve, to yours. Ali, you asked about, I won't get to all of it, but you asked about fatigue on trade-up, we do not see that. Our premium items are some of the faster growing items in our portfolio. I described what's happening in laundry, for example. That growth is really being driven by items that on a per load basis are premium priced. If you look at private labels as one indicator of trade-up fatigue, or perhaps even the reversal of consumer desire, we don't see significant changes quarter-to-quarter. Europe private label shares remained flat as they have the last three years. It\u2019s obviously different by category; I\u2019m talking on aggregate. And the U.S. private label is up 50 basis points, primarily in three categories. Our share is also up in the U.S. So, there's no indication of a broad scale shift from premium brand superior offerings wholesale to private label.","And in terms of the question on, if you will, the equivalent of same-store-sales, I really don't have that data and it's very hard to tease apart. But, what I'll tell you is, we do not win from a market growth or share standpoint if we don't do both. Our core needs to be strong. We need to innovate in our core, indicate in our core, that's the largest part of our business. At the same time, we need to meet the needs, the emerging needs of consumers, which are emerging more quickly than they ever have, whether that's new forms, new segments, new needs, and that -- we've stepped up our activity there significantly. Look at the Naturals segment as one example where our pace of activity is as high as anybody's. But still, if we did student body right, focused entirely on Naturals and neglected our core, we'd be in a very, very bad place. So, I think we've got -- maybe to the spirit of your question, I think we've got a much better balance today than we've had historically. I feel good about that. But, it's the right question to keep focusing on.","Steve, as relates to shaving, first of all, on a global basis from a market share standpoint, we're about flat versus the prior period. So, there's some element of market that continues to impact the segment. As category leaders, we have a responsibility to address that which we're working to do. I think you're looking at it the right way in terms of pacing over a little bit longer period of time, call it the first half. And I do think the first half in aggregate is representative of what the year should look like. We have very strong innovation in the back half of the year with SkinGuard being launched in both North America and Europe. We have some exciting news on the female side of the shop as well. And we continue to make progress from a user standpoint on Gillette Shave Club.","So, the first half run rate I do think is indicative of what we should be attempting to deliver over the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, Jon. So, my question\u2019s around the pricing environment. First, pricing accelerated sequentially for two straight quarters at the corporate level. Would you anticipate more progress sequentially in the back half of the year versus Q2 in terms of year-over-year pricing? And then, second, in the U.S., wanted to get an update on how the price increases are going so far, both in terms of retailer receptivity and consumer demand elasticity as well as the competitive response you're seeing in the marketplace?","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Dara. I would expect on a mathematical basis pricing to be slightly stronger driver going forward, simply because we'll have a full quarter of those prices in effect in both the second -- well, most of them in the third quarter and then certainly in the fourth quarter, or as even in the quarter we just completed. Take for example a pricing for devaluation of developing markets. There wasn't a full quarter in all markets, so that pricing reflected in our results. So, it's not a statement in terms of increasing price component of top-line; it's not a statement of intent, simply mathematical expectation.","And then, in terms of how that pricing is going, I apologize for this answer, but it really is too early to tell. Typically, it takes six, even nine months to understand exactly what's going to happen from a competitive standpoint. And we're just getting to the point on some of the initial price increases where we'll be able to understand the full retail response to both our pricing and competitive pricing, both of which have an impact obviously on our result. So, we're going to have to stay tuned on that one. Having said that, I would offer in broad terms that we have not seen anything definitive that would cause us to have a high level of concern. And I'd make that statement again on an aggregate basis. Across individual products and segments, categories and markets, there are always issues, but in aggregate, we're on track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just two quick questions. Jon, maybe you can talk about where the organic sales growth kind of over-delivered versus you're going in expectations, just to kind of get a sense of businesses that are seeing momentum faster than you had expected? And then, the second question is, I was hoping to get an update on some of the innovations that Procter has created that will be licensed out to other industries. I think you talked about that -- the plastic recycling innovation at the Analyst Day. So, just curious kind of where you are with that particular initiative. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Nik. Really the outperformance versus our going-in expectations was broad-based and you see that when you look at the segment results. Very strong across the businesses with Grooming more or less in line with where we expected, so with that exception, each outperforming. And that's true generally as well at a market level, particularly when we look at the first half of the year and the results across that first half. So, I think that's very encouraging. The improvement stool here is not one legged, it's not yet three legged either; it's not one legged. ","In terms of -- I'm glad you mentioned the monetization effort relative to our innovation that can benefit multiple categories and industries. I'm very excited about that as an opportunity to both create value -- really three things, to create value; to create fuel for even more P&G innovation, which is incredibly important; and to make an even broader difference in important areas like sustainability across multiple industries and for the benefit of a wide range of constituents. So, that is a -- when we talk about constructive disruption and changing our approach to doing business and thinking about new ways to create value for all the constituents we serve, that's a program I feel very, very good about. And we'll talk more about -- we'll provide some more color to that when we're at CAGNY together in three or four weeks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","In terms of the organic sales growth outlook, I\u2019d like some additional color on what gets you from one end of the range to other, because obviously the first half trends were clearly very encouraging, but you get the low end of the range. So, a couple of things. First, where do you think retail inventory stands now? Is there any concern around forward buying ahead of the price increases, particularly in emerging markets? And was there something -- anything significant in terms of promo timings. And just trying to better understand, if you could break those particular buckets out a little bit? And then, just secondly, if you could parse out the price contributions [Technical Difficulty]? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","I would really look at the first half top-line results Olivia as clean, if you will. If you look at -- if we look at consumption levels relative to our shipment and sales levels and triangulate with market share, everything is in line. We don't see any significant -- of course, again, at the detailed level, there is always some variability but on average level, we don't see any significant inventory distortions or promotion distortions. Again, at the category level, there can be some differences there. But generally, we look at the first half run rate as representative of the business. And we wouldn't have taken up the top end of the guidance range had we felt otherwise.","And then, we come back to what I was talking about earlier, which is just significant volatility that exists. I mean, you've seen some of the competitive statements between Henkel yesterday and KC today. Who knows what the trade situation is going to present to us. What it\u2019s going to be and what that's going to present to us in terms of not so much tariffs, though that is an impact. But the ability to, frankly, import and export products really across markets, that has an impact on our sales.","Another big driver of uncertainty is the pricing that we're taking and the impact that that has on market. So, I mean, to give you a sense, if you think about markets like Turkey, Argentina, some of the more pronounced devaluations, we're talking about 30% to 50% to 70% price increases. And those are kind of unprecedented, and they have a big impact -- they can have a big impact on market consumption. And depending on how competitors respond, they can have a big impact on market share.","So, we're simply trying to be responsible in the breadth of our guidance range to reflect the range of outcomes that we see as possible. And as I mentioned earlier, there's a -- we're just not at a point -- if we had every business growing slightly above the market, I think we\u2019d be much more confident in bringing up the lower end of the range as well. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re not there yet in either Baby or Grooming, which are two large businesses. So, again, our change in guidance range is a positive one, it's built on confidence but also informed by open-eyed objectivity in terms of the difficult deal environment that we face.","In terms of pricing -- kind of price mix across developing and developed, as you'd expect, given the devaluation levels of developing market currencies, pricing level is higher there. The combination of price mix is call it 5% to 8% kind of range. In developed markets, it\u2019s more even with price positive and mix a slight negative, given for example, the relative performance of Gillette versus some of the other businesses. So, no different pattern than I think you'd expect to see.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks. Good morning. Jon, I was curious, if you could talk a little bit about enterprise markets and the organizational structural changes, and you shared this to the Street now couple weeks back. If you could just give us a little bit of color on sort of practical steps that are underway for changing operating structure of those businesses? And also, if going forward you'll be willing to talk about kind of growth rates you are seeing for enterprise markets versus focus markets? And I guess even this current quarter, what growth looks like for the U.S., what looks like for developed markets in total and then developed non-U.S.? ","Jon Moeller","Okay. A lot in there, Lauren, which I will try to deal effectively with. As you mentioned, you used the word weeks, which is the appropriate word to use of the time spent since we first started talking about the new structure, and we've been working hard since then to bring that to life. As we indicated, we want to go into next fiscal year, July 1st with that structure fully alive.","And, we spent a fair amount of time defining what the -- what role each organization is going to play. And I want to be clear that there's -- the design intent here is to drive global categories but approach that growth opportunity in two different ways, one in large and largely developed markets and another that we think will be more effective in the enterprise markets. But, it's not -- the enterprise markets, I expect will -- not expect, I know their strategies will be driven by the global strategies of the categories, our supply chains will be global, managed by the global categories. Our pricing strategies will be informed by global pricing categories. And really the enterprise markets job becomes maximizing the opportunity given those parameters on a daily basis, making decisions real time in the markets without having to do a lot of internal transaction processing to get decisions made. And we'll be clear about that as we get closer to implementation. But I think it really holds promise. When you operate everything one way, by definition, you play to the least common denominator everywhere. And we want to move off of that and we think this is a much stronger approach.","We are not going to change our segment reporting but we will continue to give color on what's happening in important markets whether they\u2019re enterprise markets or focused markets, just as we have today. And in terms of the growth rates for the quarter we just completed, if we look at developed markets, classically defined organic sales growth was 2%, there's some variability within that, I mentioned Japan at 9%, the U.S. was a little less than 2%, developing markets growing in the last quarter at 7%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Thank you. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. So, Jon, I wanted to go back to the pricing but layer it with the A&P spend. You had about 200 basis points benefits on price mix on the top line but about 50 basis points gross margin benefit. So, is that a result of the change in accounting for promotions or increasing support to the brands as you introduced the price increase and that gap should narrow going forward to your benefit? And if I can squeeze in a second question on the China diapers, can you update us on what happened this quarter? So from the declining volumes in the previous quarter due to pricing, did it normalize, and what should we expect going forward? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Let me handle the second one first. We had a difficult quarter in China in the first quarter as you alluded to with sales down double digits. The quarter that we just completed, sales were up double digits, up about 12%. We performed very well in the two major online events in the quarter, which were our 11\/11 and 12\/12, becoming the number one diaper brand on both JD and Alibaba. The premium part of our business there continues to do extremely well, about a 280 index versus year ago; that's taped and pants. And that's encouraging because that's the fastest growing part of the market. Our overall share grew past three months by a little over a point. Again, most of that in the premium segment of the business, up about 3 points overall, up about 5 points online. We do continue to experience significant softness on the mainline taped business, which is down about 25%, and we did lose a little bit of value share there. But, that shift largely reflects market shifts in terms of preference for premium offerings.","You can look -- the obvious question, as you look at those two quarters is, which one is -- which one represents the future. And we're fairly confident about back half growth in China; we\u2019ve got a very strong program with Chinese New Year and strong innovation plans.","I apologize on your first question, which is why I went to your second question first. I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I am happy to talk to you later in the day, or you can talk to John, and it's my shortcoming for not catching it at all. But, relative to mix, the fastest growing portion of our business is -- was just indicated in the discussion, on Baby Care and also in the discussion we had earlier on Fabric Care, has tended over the more recent periods of time to be driven by the premium part of the portfolio. And what I think sometimes gets misunderstood is that doesn't necessarily mean the higher margin part of the portfolio. So, take laundry as an example. If you assume just for a second, and we don't assume this, but assume we have a fixed number of loads that are done across the world every year, if we can do -- if we can receive more revenue for each one of those loads and generate more profit for our shareowners on each one of those loads, I don't care a whole lot about margin. We've -- we're creating value. And so, what you see in some of those premium offerings is higher per unit, per use profit, albeit at a slightly lower margin. And as those items grow faster than the balance of the portfolio, you see that reflected in margin mix, for instance, on the gross margin line.","I'm not sure that's what you were asking, but that's one of the drivers and at least the gross margin mix currently.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","So, given your recent success in a lot of market share gains, particularly in the United States and private label also gaining share, how are the retailer conversations evolving as planograms are getting reset? Is there a difference in the category assortment conversation, meaning that Procter continues to consolidate number one, and number two and number three brands get displayed? How does this also shape their outlook for the ability to lean in for store-brand offerings? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","As you can imagine, an aggregate level answer to that question is not terribly relevant, it's very different across categories and across retail partners. I mentioned, first of all, just from a premise standpoint, the private label growth, that's occurring largely in 3 of our 10 categories. And even the level of private label market share that exists is very different across the categories from relatively well-developed to almost non-existent. So, the conversations are different and varied.","Having said that, a couple generalities that I would draw. I can't imagine -- well, at least in my experience, which is somewhat limited in this regard. But, I can't recall a conversation with a retail partner that wasn't interested in category growing, category driving premium price items. They're very interested in that as a quickest way for them to grow their market basket and their organic sales line and do it in a sustainable, constructive fashion. I think there continues to be room, just given the diversity of consumers for both types of offerings and most retail outlets. I don't see this being an either or type of game. I do think the point that you made about market leaders and drivers of market growth; and items on the other end of the portfolio is kind of bipolar, if you will, growth strategy is in play at some retail customers. And as a result, I think the least attractive place to be right now is in the middle. And that relates both to performance and price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to circle back with the question on your guidance. And while you raised your top-line, you did maintain your EPS growth and you called out a few headwinds that will impact your bottom line. But, could you talk further about the cost of growth as you see it and then your expectation for this going forward? And then, in other words, is it a fair statement that in this environment it's simply costing you more to generate faster growth?","Jon Moeller","I don't necessarily -- I understand the nature of the question and I have an appreciation for it. I wouldn't say though that broadly that's the case. If you look at the quarter we just completed, our growth was among the highest of recent quarters. That's now true for two quarters. And if I look, for example at our marketing spending as a percentage of sales, because of all the productivity initiatives that I described earlier, that number -- while we have a stronger marketing program than we've ever had with higher reach that we're investing in as we reduce access to frequency, reduce agency and production costs, et cetera, so very strong advertising program, it's not costing us more per, if you will, dollar of revenue gained.","Also, I know there was a lot of concern and justifiably so, a couple of quarters ago across the industry relative to promotion levels, and those have generally are come down, both in our case and in the case of competitors, which you would expect as you are generally in a cycle of price increases. So, the data that I have while I'm sure I could make a use case to support your point, broadly doesn't seem to be representative of the world that we face. Now, I do think the premium that\u2019s placed on excellence of execution has increased. There's no room for anything other than excellence, which is why we continue to bang the drum internally and externally on superiority but I don't -- if you do that well, there continues to be a strong appeal as witnessed again by the faster growth and some of the premium priced items within the portfolio. So, I don't think in aggregate, we're in a place where the cost of growth has to be higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Thanks. Good morning. Jon, just coming back to Grooming, we're about to hit the two-year anniversary of the price cuts in the U.S. on the systems. And so, I'm trying to understand with where you stand now with seeing still some organic growth declines with kind of market share being relatively flat. As you look back, was that a good idea, is it something you would have repeated? And does it say something about the category that having to do that kind of cuts two years later still keeps you just status quo that the category really has more challenges beyond price that you're facing?","Jon Moeller","If you look at the first half growth rates in Grooming, the business is essentially flat versus a year ago with much better volume share and value share trends than was the case prior to the pricing. So, we've basically stabilized the share position on the business, which is important. Which leads you to your second question, which is the right question, and there is a lot that's impacting the categories that's outside of that pricing dynamic. And the biggest impact is the societal impacts in the incidence of shaving, both in -- both here and in Europe. The good news is, the market decline across manufacturers that's occurred as a result of that is waning. So, the drag on a quarter-by-quarter basis is lessening. The good news is, as I mentioned that our share positions are stabilizing and strengthening. And that's why relative to an earlier question, we talked about a reasonably strong business in the back half of the year. Big innovations come in as well with SkinGuard, both here and in Europe. So, I called out that business as one that requires more attention and more effort to fully turn. That remains the case. Looking back in one person's judgment, were we wrong and taking that pricing? Absolutely not. And has it been effective in terms of stabilizing our share position? Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Hey, guys, good morning. Since we\u2019re talking about Grooming, I guess I'll start there. First, was weakness that you saw in response to the emerging market pricing this quarter worse than you expected or in line? And secondly what was U.S. organic growth in the quarter? And I think you mentioned the U.S. market growth was below 2%. So, what did market share trends look like versus the 40 basis-point gain you saw last quarter? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So, I'm not sure Joe that I can give you precise answers across all of your questions on the call but you can follow up with John and get the specifics. Generally though, the trends were difficult in the U.S. with the first full quarter of the Harry's expansion et cetera, and better in other parts of the world. And John can give you a further breakdown of that.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI. ","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. In past quarters you've talked about the disproportionate market share gains that you're getting in e-commerce. And I'm wondering, and you talked a little bit I guess about that in China diapers. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little bit more details on how you're doing in e-commerce in the U.S. and China by category, and how that's playing out in terms of share? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Generally doing very well in e-commerce, 30% growth last quarter, now approaching about 8% of our business. We're finding success across e-tail customers. And across categories, obviously there's a degree of variability there. But, I think the general message and the takeaway is broadly successful. We don't take that for granted for a nanosecond. It's a very fast-growing part of the business that we're constantly adapting our offerings to serve. And that's everything from the way that offering is communicated to a consumer, to the size of the package, to the ability of the package to survive the journey to a consumer's home and our relevance to the individual e-tail partners, but broadly, very successful.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","Two questions real quick. First, picking up on a comment you made in the very opening statements. You mentioned that the highest margin competitors you have, I think Reckitt, Colgate you called out, cited their exposure to health care as the reason for the segment to the higher margin? Is that true of your own segments and does that tell us something about the maybe the direction? What kind of dynamics are present that maybe are present in your health care portfolio or elsewhere that maybe are instructive for your direction?","And second question is, oil is down 35% in the quarter -- end of your last fiscal quarter into this fiscal quarter that you just reported, historically that's been a reasonable indicator of prospective costs. Can you give me a couple of big clouds for why that might not be the case of this time? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Consumer health care margins, to your first question, are generally very attractive. We find that to be an attractive business. It's both a business that has historically grown at very attractive rates and it's done so at very high margins, relatively high margins. And that does explain part of our interest in that category and does explain some of the actions we've taken to increase our presence in that category. And I've been talking for a long time, when asked about where we're interested in adding to our portfolio, I've typically mentioned OTC health Care and Skin and Personal Care as areas that we have both the freedom from a category concentration standpoints and generally the financial attractiveness to at least responsibly explore opportunities to add to our portfolio in those categories. And I would not expect that to -- that should continue.","In terms of the question -- your question on oil price, two quick points to make there. One is, and I know this wasn't your question, but just for clarity, given the opportunity. About 1% of our commodity exposure is kind of directly oil; about 5% of our commodity exposure is highly correlated to oil in relatively short periods of time. There's another big chunk of our commodity exposure that is to the petro complex, but that is not highly correlated in short periods of time to the price movements of oil, it's more driven by demand and supply dynamics within those individual supply chains.","Typically, the bleed through effects, if you will take 6 to 9 months, which is why in this update you don't see us making big changes, because within the forecast period we're talking about, which is the next five months, but we're not expecting big changes. But, clearly, to the extent that those prices stay low, we would expect some bleed through to our commodity costs over time, obviously things like pulp are unaffected by that as are some of the other materials. I know this wasn't part of your question either, but for completeness, lower oil though is not necessarily a net positive from a holistic earnings per share standpoint. It will have some impact on commodity costs, as we\u2019ve just discussed, but it also has impacts on consumer confidence and on personal budgets in producing countries. And it can have a significant impact on the ability to purchase products in our categories in those countries. So, you need to be careful as you look at oil, both relative to its direct cause and effect on our commodity structure, but also the impact it has on the demand environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask you just first, broadly, any change in how you think about category growth on a global basis? And then, depending on I guess the answer to that, are you seeing any increasing distance between your growth or maybe even broadly kind of the haves and have-nots across various categories and geographies? In particular, if you go back to a couple of years ago, local and regional competitors, I think have generally done a better job than they did maybe 10 years ago. Is that gap narrowing between the multinationals and local and regional? If not, is it some of the bigger multinationals are kind of stepping the game and pressuring some of the others? And I say that more on a developing market basis, just given that you\u2019ve had much stronger growth in that business than in developed markets, but feel free to answer kind of how you see it across whatever geographies makes sense.","Jon Moeller","Category growth is improving slightly, which is very encouraging. And we see that fairly broadly. We see that in the U.S., we see that in developing markets. So, that has been a positive dynamic and is a recent dynamic. Don't get me wrong. We're not talking about categories moving from a 2.5% growth to 5% growth; we're talking about categories moving from 2.5% to 3% growth on a global basis. But all good, all good.","In terms of the near-term competitive environment. The local and regional brands are continuing to perform extremely well from both the growth rates -- primarily from a growth rate standpoint, but also, if we look at who's gaining share, in many cases, they are the share gainers, where we've lost business and lost share that has typically been -- and obviously this is a highly general aggregate statement, but has more frequently been to those local and regional competitors than to our global multinational competitors. So, there are clear exceptions to that. So, the gap continues to narrow. That is -- that explains a couple of things in terms of our own strategy. One, again is to redouble our efforts on meaningful obvious superiority and that's not just versus branded manufacturers, that's versus private label manufacturers; that's not just against global competitors, that's against local competitors. And that is extremely important that we maintain a positive position there. The other, as we have made our real effort to distribute resources more in market as opposed to at regional or global headquarters. China is very good example where we\u2019ve been very intentional in doing exactly that for exactly the reasons you cite, being as close to those consumers as we possibly can, being as close to the evolving competitive environment as we possibly can and its\u2019 made a real difference.","So, again, we, as you know in the quarter we just completed, are in a share growth position. But we don\u2019t take any of that for granted and are considering the entire competitive set as we calibrate the sufficiency of our efforts.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen","Hi, everybody. Thanks for fitting me in, and this is a bit of a follow-on to the last question. Jon, can you give us kind of a broad-based update on the global supply chain work that you\u2019re doing? And the reason that I am asking is, I am wondering whether you\u2019re considering this work more kind of table stakes in terms of serving retailers and channels and end consumers or whether you\u2019re working towards the infrastructure you think can be that can be truly differentiated and kind of a source of competitive advantage, maybe through better unit costs, speed to market, service levels, et cetera? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Good question, Jon. and I would say, the intent is both. Retailers are demanding more in terms of service levels on the part of manufacturers, and we need to restructure and retool ourselves to be superior in delivering against their needs.","I do believe that in addition to that -- to those table stakes moves, as you described that we need to make that there are real sources of competitive advantage that we\u2019re creating through our supply chain transformation. A simple aggregation of multiple categories within a site has a huge impact on unit costs, 50% of the cost of manufacturing facilities, the infrastructure of that facility, the roads, the rail spurs, the utilities et cetera.","Even more importantly, the service we can provide as a multi-category supplier with full trucks at -- and quantities for each category that work for individual retail partners at very effective costs because we can combine both products that cube out truck and products that weight out of truck, and can deliver those products on a daily basis to our retail partners is a real competitive advantage.","I think the ability to, if you will, white paper our processes and manufacturing platforms, I talked about robotics and the digitization that\u2019s recurring at our factories. We will make step function improvements -- exponential improvements versus where we were and I think where most of our competitors, not all but many of our competitors are. So, thanks for raising the question. I think it will serve both. We\u2019re still midstream in our efforts here, so there is more work to do and there are more savings to come.","I want to thank everybody for your time this morning. Again, we\u2019re very excited about the first half of our fiscal year and the progress we\u2019ve made, but are not declaring victory, have more work to do to further improve results and are committed to do that.","Please take the increase in the topline guidance as indicative of confidence, not fear, but wanting to be very realistic with you about the environment that we see and we operate in. And hopefully we'll continue to make progress. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17540":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Q3 2018 Results Conference Call April 19, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","John Chevalier - VP, IR","Jon Moeller - CFO","David Taylor - Chairman of Board, President & CEO","Analysts","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call.","P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10K, 10Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning, I'm pleased to be joined this morning by David Taylor, P&G's Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Chevalier our Vice President, Investor Relations.","I'm going to start this morning with a brief review of the Company's results for the January\/March quarter and our outlook for the fiscal year. David will provide additional perspective on the year and update on key strategic focus areas and perspective on the announcements we made this morning regarding the planned acquisition of Merck KGaA's OTC healthcare portfolio and the dissolution of our over-the-counter healthcare joint venture with Teva. We will then open up the call for questions.","This was a challenging quarter in a very tough environment. We grew through the challenges delivering modest top and bottom line growth. We continued improving productivity while investing in our brands. As a result, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives, but we must and will do better than this. The ecosystems in which we operate around the world are being disrupted and transformed.","We must change at an even faster rate winning through superiority, stronger cost and cash productivity and a strengthened organization and culture. Good news, we increased the dividend by 4%, the 62nd consecutive year the P&G dividend has been increased. We also announced this morning significant moves that will strengthen our hand in OTC healthcare positively contributing to the Company's growth and profitability.","Overall volume of value share trends continued to improve. Volume shares now in line with prior year levels improving in both developed and developing markets. Seven of 10 global categories are now growing or holding volume share. Value share is down 30 basis points all in and adjusting for intra-category mix impact is down just 10 basis points. Several large businesses are moving to positive share trends. Feminine Care and Skin and Personal Care shares are growing.","Global Shave Care value share is now in line with prior year on both a three and a six month basis. Fabric Care, Home Care and Personal Health Care are all growing share. Sales growth has been challenging in a very difficult market environment. We have large businesses in several difficult markets Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Nigeria, Brazil collectively more than a 30-basis point top-line headwind.","Retail trade transformation in the U.S. is reshaping our categories. Rapid shifts to e-commerce and aggressive inventory management, trade inventory reductions, primarily in the U.S. drove strong organic sales down by roughly a point this quarter. From a business standpoint, we're not where we need to be on two large businesses, Baby Care and grooming. David will discuss both.","The balance of the Company portfolio is growing organic sales over 3% fiscal year-to-date. We have opportunities continued to improve noticeable product, packaging, communication, go-to-market, and value superiority of our offerings across the portfolio and to fuel this with even increased levels of productivity, each of which we are committed to do.","All-in sales were up 4% including about 3 point benefit from the net of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales grew 1%. Organic sales growth was again volume driven with volume up 2%.","We delivered solid organic sales growth in Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Personal Health Care and Skin and Personal Care. Looking geographically, we delivered mid single-digit growth in Greater China, Japan, France and the Philippines; high single growth in Russia; double-digit organic sales growth in India and Turkey.","E-commerce sales continue to be very strong, up more than 30% fiscal year-to-date. We are holding or growing e-commerce market share in 8 of our 10 product categories. This growth was partially offset by results in Baby Care and Grooming, both of which were down this quarter versus the prior year.","Mix mainly from strong growth of premium priced products added 1 point to organic sales growth. Pricing rounded to a 2 point headwind on organic sales. On its face, the rounded number may appear like a substantial increase in pricing investment, unrounded it\u2019s about 1.5 points, about 30 basis points different than last quarter with some factors driving the pricing now starting to annualize.","U.S. Gillette pricing interventions reduced organic sales by about 30 basis points. We annualized the price change at the start of this month and we expect stronger sales going forward. The U.S. Oral Care business recently rescinded the list price increase they've taken last year in the U.S., which left us operated at an unsustainable price premium. This dynamic is causing a short-term negative price impact as well that would start annualize in July.","Fabric and Home Care pricing is lower due to promotional investments to maintain competitiveness in the U.S. and Europe. These two will annualize later this calendar year. Looking forward, we will continue to ensure our brands inclusive of product performance, remain an excellent competitive value for consumers. This will include price increases and mix improvement as we bring new meaningful benefits to market.","We will also price to offset rising commodity costs when the degree of the cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it. With this plus the annualization of key investments, we currently expect to return to positive price trends some time next fiscal year. On the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $0.95, up 2% versus the prior year. This includes $0.04 per share of non-core restructuring costs and $0.01 of non-core charges related to the tax act.","Core earnings per share were $1, up 4%. Our operating margin declined to 100 basis points. Our gross margin declined to 110 basis points due mainly to higher commodity and freight costs. Core SG&A cost decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of sales. Productivity savings and cost of goods and SG&A were a 310 basis point benefit for the quarter.","The core effective tax rate was 21%; 2 points below the year ago level due mainly to the impact of the U.S. tax act. This benefit was partially offset by increased interest expense and currency swap cost as we optimized international cash management under the new U.S. tax laws. The rate was somewhat lower than we anticipated last quarter as we continue to gain a deeper understanding of the provisions enacted as part of the tax act.","Adjusted free cash flow productivity was a strong 95%. We will continue to make good improvements in working capital as we leverage our supply chain financing initiatives. We repurchased $1.4 billion of shares and distributed $1.8 billion in dividends in total $3.2 billion of value returned to shareowners this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we increased the dividend by 4%, the 62nd consecutive annual increase and a 128th consecutive years P&G has paid a dividend.","Moving to guidance for fiscal 2018, we're maintaining our guidance range for organic sales growth of 2% or 3%. We're at 1.4% fiscal year-to-date leaving as at the low end of this range potentially rounded up to 2% for the full year. We expect fiscal 2018 all in sales growth of about 3%. This includes a net benefit from the combination of foreign exchange acquisitions and divestitures.","We're raising our outlook for core earnings per share growth from a range of 5% to 8% to a range of 6% to 8%. Commodities are projected to be a $350 million after tax headwind for the year consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter. Transportation costs are now a $200 million headwind for the year. Foreign exchange is roughly $175 million after tax benefit. The combined impact of commodities, transportation and foreign exchange are $0.14 per share impact on core earnings per share, a four point drag on core earnings per share growth.","Despite these headwinds, we expect a return to gross margin and operating margin improvement in the fourth quarter, driven by strong productivity progress while maintaining investments in our brands. We now expect the core effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 22% to 22.5% about a half point lower than our previous outlook. As we discussed last quarter, the changes included in the U.S. tax act are broad and complex. The charges we booked for the non-core impacts and the core effective rate may ultimately differ from our current estimates and require further true up.","There's still potential for changes and regulatory interpretation of tax act provisions. There may be legislative actions that arise because of the act and our estimates of the impacts may change as we refine our calculations for earnings and exchange rates for our foreign subsidiaries. We're also increasing our guidance for adjusted free cash flow productivity from 90% to approximately 95%, reflecting strong year-to-date results in our outlook for the fourth quarter.","This guidance includes capital spending in the range of 5 to 5.5% of sales. Fiscal 2018 will be another year of significant cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay nearly $7.5 billion dollars in dividends and repurchase shares in the range of $6 billion to $8 billion this year. Combined return between 13.5 to 15.5 billion dollars of value to shareowners, following 22 billion last fiscal year and 16 billion in fiscal 2016.","In summary, we're growing the top and bottom line in a difficult environment with improving market share trends. We're driving cost and cash productivity, returning cash to shareowners, investing for the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands and strengthening our OTC healthcare hand.","I'll now turn over to David, who'll talk more about our strategic priorities, the baby and grooming businesses and the acquisitions we announced this morning.","David Taylor","Thanks Jon. Before I talk about the longer term strategic choices we've made, I want to be very clear about something. This is not business as usual at P&G. We will make additional changes needed to accelerate progress. The strategy needed to deliver balanced top and bottom-line growth requires accelerated progress against the five elements of superiority, product, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value, both consumer and customer as well as stronger progress in productivity to fund these changes.","We also recognized and are taken additional actions to make the needed organizational changes to enable greater speed, local agility and accountability. While our plan is to clearly showing evidence of progress in many areas, we have not yet tied it all together to deliver the industry leading balanced growth in value creation we expect of ourselves.","Before I go further, I want to underscore a point that Jon just made, about how we\u2019re managing this fiscal year. We\u2019ve made a deliberate choice to keep investing in product and package improvements, sales resources, marketing and consumer value despite profit pressure from commodity cost and sluggish sales growth to continue to strengthen the long-term and health and competitiveness of our brands.","Now one example of the additional interventions made include the additional $200 to $300 million of savings to mitigate a portion of the investments needed and deliver our fiscal year objectives, but more is needed to fuel the top plan and deliver share growth and what has been a more challenging environment. What we won\u2019t do is sacrifice the long-term health of the business by cutting import investments.","As you know our portfolio is daily used categories were products solve problems that consumers care about and perform drives brand choice. We understand what it takes to win in all 10 of our core categories. In brand country combinations where we judge ourselves to be noticeably superior in at least four to five elements that we\u2019ve talked, we\u2019re seeing consistent meaningful improvement in the financial measures to success household penetration, which is beginning new users, market growth, value share growth, sales growth and profit.","However, there is still too many brand country combinations where we aren\u2019t superior in at least four of the elements and then these parts of the business we\u2019re not growing at the rate we need to. I\u2019m going to give some very clear examples where we\u2019ve not delivered yet and we\u2019re taking additional steps to address this.","First, Baby Care, Baby Care is our largest improvement opportunity. The challenges we faced are market specific and are very well understood. We\u2019re addressing them quickly and they\u2019ve taken longer than planned to resolve, but recent trends in China on our global pants in naturals launch illustrate that we can make progress with important growing segments. Now, we need to get the total brand growing across the key markets that is the next step.","I\u2019ll give you a little more detail on China baby because I know it\u2019s a high interest area. Overall, diaper organic sales in China were up 2% this quarter. This is important turning point, not the end point, but the first quarter of growth in 16 quarters. We\u2019re getting our portfolio adjusted and we\u2019re getting the capacity and plans in place to win. This compares to a 12% decline at the first half of the year. Clearly, we\u2019re making progress and what\u2019s driving the progress and improvements is pant style diapers and premium taped diapers.","We\u2019re starting to win at the fastest growing segments. Now, they\u2019ll all say the declines in mid tier tapped diapers while our mid tier tape diapers account for about half of our diaper sales in the segment itself is declining into double digit rate. We need to make and are making the needed the interventions to stabilize that segment. But clearly success needs to be winning big on the growing forms whilst stabilizing mainline. If not to plan is it working but clearly its taking more time to stabilize the mainline this distant plan.","Let me move to the U.S., here we faced a very different set of challenges. The market is changing and some customers are aggressively pursuing private label with aggressive pricing. The lower private label pricing has been a real challenge particularly for our Loves brands. While we've taken some steps to restore Loves' competitiveness, it hasn\u2019t had the desired effect yet. For perspective, prices are down almost 20% in some areas. We are taking more action including marketing, in-store presence, and where needed value adjustments.","Looking around the world, Pampers is a large brand in many difficult markets that Jon mentioned earlier in Middle-East, Africa and Brazil. We are going to start to annualize some of these market specific dynamics over the next few quarters. We've also had a tough period in Europe, which has started to reverse. A clear bright spot for Baby Care is the continued progress of Pampers' pants. This segment makes up 25% of the global diaper category and is growing at a mid-teen rate. Pants style diapers now account for 27% of all diaper changes, up 3.5 points in the last year.","Majority of global diaper market growth over the next five years will be driven by pants style products, so it's absolutely critical that we win here. Pampers pants is held the number one global value share position for more than a year currently at about 28% of the form and is extended its lead against the highly capable set of competitors. Another business that's been difficult to grow at our target rates is our Grooming business.","We made a very instead of tough choices to improve our position in grooming in the U.S. a year-ago and we're seeing some positive progress. The U.S. male shave care business grew volume for the fourth straight quarter with male shaving systems up 10% this quarter. We expect the strong shipment growth -- shipment volume growth we've delivered over the last year to translate in the stronger sales growth now that the price changes annualizing this quarter.","This is starting to play out as we're growing volume share and value share in the past one and three month basis in the U.S. Ultimately, our objective is to grow the number of users of Gillette blades and razors. The volume trends to be all encouraging. This is a big improvement following years of declines as of many as 2 million users, and we know we're now facing a new challenge on Gillette in the U.S. where value to your competitors expanding the in-store distribution this quarter, and some of the competitors are expanding their direct-to-consumer proposition to new markets in Europe.","We see these. They are not surprises and we have strong plans in place to support Gillette. When we get the superiority model in place, we stimulate market growth and market share growth. I shared a quiet of few of these examples when we talked at the CAGNY Conference in February. Our Fabric Care business in the U.S., Japan and several markets in Europe are Always Discreet Incontinence products SK-II, Olay in China, and Fairy and Dawn Hand dishwashing liquids. I also shared that we need to respond to a changing world and the changing consumer set of needs. One obvious area is increased demand for natural and sustainable products.","First, the couple of comments on the sustainability consumers, here we've had a number of innovations. They include products like Tide, Gain and Ariel unit those detergents. The most compacted detergents available. On the natural side, we are getting to gain and getting new with conviction with brands like Tide Purclean, Gain Botanicals and Dreft Purtouch, they're bio-based olefins and deliver outstanding cleaning performance to consumers want in addition to the naturals profile.","In FemCare, we've launched Whisper pure cotton in the China with the 100% natural cotton top sheet. Pure cotton is off to a very strong start with sales more than double our ingoing expectations. In Baby Care, we're expanding distribution of Pampers' pure protection diapers made with no fragrance, parabens or chlorine bleach. And Pampers' Aqua Pure Wipes made with 99% water and premium cotton.","So far the retailer support has been very good and early consumer reviews are encouraging. For perspective, already our share of in-store is passing several category incumbents in this space that had been in the market much longer. Consumers want performance and more natural ingredients and less of an environmental footprint. P&G brands can deliver that to them. One other example is our recently launched ZzzQuil PURE Zzzs. This is a melatonin based sleep aid, free of artificial flavors, gluten, lactose, and gelatin also with good distribution results.","These organic innovations strengthen our brand equities and attract new users to brands they already know, but now for the combination of performance and added natural and sustainability benefits they want. In many cases, a strong brand can carry this segment. In other cases, we\u2019ll need additional brands. We\u2019ve augmented these organic innovations with recent acquisitions international space. Native, a natural deodorant, and Snowberry Skin Care, a Naturals' brand based in New Zealand. We remained open to whatever it takes to make sure that we win in this fast growing segment.","Next, I would like to comment a little bit on the strengthening of the Personal Health Care portfolio, a category we have previously identified as very attractive to us. Today, we are announcing to be a meaningful step forward. I am sure you\u2019ve all read, we\u2019ve agreed with Teva to terminate our PGT partnership effective July 1. We operated a very successful JV with Teva for nearly seven years. We grew organic sales at a compound average rate of almost 8%.","However, we and Teva have concluded that our strategies and priorities going forward are no longer aligned. The partnership accomplished everything we intended and I want to thank Teva's management, employees who work side-by-side with us to make it such a success. We are moving post Teva to strengthen our OTC capabilities and growth opportunities to with the acquisition of Merck's consumer healthcare business.","Merck's talent and portfolio is a near perfect replacement for the capability and scale lost by dissolving the PGT JV, bringing the significant technical and commercial capability in-house that will complement the capabilities that already reside in P&G\u2019s global consumer health care business. This deal adds a portfolio of about $1 billion in annual sales primarily in Europe, Latin America and Asia. It has been growing mid-to-high single digits.","Another benefit of this acquisition is that Merck's OTC brands bring benefit to new therapeutic areas. They cover a range of treatment areas including relieving muscle, joint, and back pain; colds and headaches as well as supporting physical activity and mobility. Many of treatments -- treatment areas are not currently addressed in our current P&G portfolio.","Currently P&G\u2019s OTC business generates over $2 billion in annual sales and has been a growth and value creation leader for P&G, delivering profitable mid single-digit growth. Our portfolio includes the single largest consumer health care brand in the world Vicks, with over $1 billion in annual sales.","With Vicks, we are leader in OTC cough cold treatments and in digestive health with the Metamucil, Pepto-Bismol and Align brands. We see several areas where Merck's capabilities can accelerate P&G\u2019s brands and businesses. We believe Personal Health Care will continue to be a financially attractive category. It\u2019s a huge category at about $230 billion in sales and with strong profit margins.","The three megatrends that are supported growth of OTC healthcare for the last decade, and they should continue for many years to come. First the aging population, today they're about 650 million people age 65 or over. This is projected to more than double to about 1.6 billion people by 2050. Over the same time period, the global average lifespan is projected to increase by almost 8 years.","Second, as people age, they are focusing more on wellness instead of associating old with a number. People are associating age with how they feel and the quality of their life. And the third big one is consumers are taking more control of their health and wellness, proactively seeking information on products and services that improve their quality of life. In addition, both public and private sectors are trying to mitigate rising healthcare costs.","Given this demographic and societal context, consumers in developed markets already spent a substantial amount of discretionary income on health and wellness. And as incomes grow in emerging markets, they are also spending more to manage their family's health. As a result, we continue to believe that companies with the best consumer insights with meaningful consumer driven innovations deliver on trusted brands will be best positioned to capitalize on these trends.","Leveraging leading capabilities, technologies and brand assets to solve problems for consumers and improve their lives, completely consistent with the strategy for the whole of P&G. Now, I hope you can see, OTC healthcare is a very attractive market and we're excited to add Merck's brands and talent to P&G.","Now, I'll turn it over to Jon to give you some more details on the financial implications for P&G of these transactions including the dissolution of the PGT joint venture with Teva.","Jon Moeller","The Procter & Gamble-Teva joint venture will continue to operate through June, the end of our fiscal year; and the Merck deal will close outside of the fiscal year. So, there's no impact from either transaction on fiscal 2018 forecasts or results. Completion of the Merck consumer health care transaction is of course subject to customary, antitrust, reviews and approvals, while we don't anticipate issues it's difficult to predict precisely when that transaction will close.","If we assume the Merck transaction closes at the end of the calendar year, we expect that we will add about $500 million to P&G all in sales and will be neutral to organic sales, core earnings per share and all in earnings per share growth in fiscal 2019. It will be accretive after that, growing at a faster rate and the balance of the Company at very attractive margins.","We don't expect significant impacts to capital allocation choices and obviously have full line of sight to the deal, as we made the decision to increase the dividend by more than we did in the prior year.","David Taylor","Thanks Jon. We're excited about the potential of this combination creates to continue strong profitable growth of our personal health care business and the balance of the portfolio we're expanding into new relevant benefit areas, amidst these several organic expansions in the natural space. We're solving more problems for consumers Always Discreet in female incontinence except these in fabric enhancers, and we're innovating quicker and more cost-effectively using lean innovation techniques.","We're making progress but we face highly capable competitors who continued to innovate their products and business models, addressing these challenges and extending our product package and demand creation superiority will require investment which underscores the importance of productivity. We will continue to drive productivity improvement to lower cost and generate cash. This must accelerate even from today's pace. We completed a $10 billion productivity program in fiscal 2015 when the second year of a five year program targeting to deliver up to another $10 billion of the savings.","I\u2019ll give you another example of where it's not business as usual for P&G and we\u2019re going to accelerate or pace of change, includes our supply chain transformation and the work we\u2019re going to do reinvent the media supply chain. We\u2019ve talked with you before about the progress we\u2019re making to transform our supply chain. We\u2019re starting production of the first of several categories at our new state-of-the-art multi-category manufacturing facility West Virginia. You\u2019ve probably heard about the changes we\u2019re making in the media supply chain and our work with agencies.","We\u2019re taking big steps to reinvent the media supply chain and how our brands work with agencies. And we\u2019re pioneering a new approach is to dramatically improve our brand building. Agency reinvention is attempting to raise the bar in superior brand communication with greater productivity on non-working marketing spending we create the means to reinvest in maybe and sampling to drive growth.","We started with upgrading and consolidating agencies from 6,000 to 2,500. They\u2019ve been 750 million through 2017. The next phase which goes to 2021 consolidates further to 1,250 agencies and saves another 400 to reinventing agency models. I mentioned just a few of the biggest changes. They include a fixed inflow model where we structure a fixed retainer with the core agency for work like large campaign supplemented with open sourcing agencies on an in and out basis for a flow to the work model.","People first approach where we identified the star creative talent we want in our businesses from across agencies and bringing them together for better creativity importantly at the speed of the market and in-sourcing work like media planning that can be done at greater value inside P&G. New media, new support models, some with, some without the TV led communication plan. Our key principal is to connect our brands to consumers in that people empowered, agile and accountable with more resource collocated closer to the consumers they served. While we\u2019ve made progress, further changes will be made to accelerate improvement.","We\u2019re reducing production cost and ensuring that ads we buy are reaching intended consumers at the appropriate time and place. We\u2019re driving media transparency to reduce waste and lower costs. We estimate we've eliminated significant media waste over the past year and we invested those savings to increase reach by 10% in trial program by about 50%. At the same time, we continue to reexamine our organization structure to identify new opportunities to improve productivity, reducing corporate, central staff in reinvesting in resources closer to consumers and customers.","We\u2019re focused not just on cost productivity but also on cash. And an important cash productivity project has been supply chain financing which we continue to expand. This program which is a win for suppliers and P&G has yielded nearly $5 billion in cash in the five years we\u2019ve been driving it. Productivity improvement will be critical to fund investments for sales in market share growth while continuing to expand profit margins. Alongside the productivity work, we continue to evolve our organizational structure and culture to position us to whether the changing retail and competitive landscape.","Clearly, we have learnt and we\u2019re acting on having more resources closer to consumers we serve with higher accountability, more agility and greater speed. Excuse me -- we\u2019re now nine months into the implementation of the end-to-end and freedom within a framework organizational model, simplifying the structure and clarifying responsibility and accountability. We're still in the early stages of the new design, learning, improving and reapplying success models as we go.","Now to give you just the best evidence that I have that is making a difference is what we've done in greater China. We moved from minus 5% sales growth two years ago to plus 6% as clear to date, and I certainly recognize that we plan more changes will be made to ensure we're winning across the broader share of markets. We've talked to you several times about the changes for making in mastery, supplementing on internal talent with skilled, experience external hiring will strengthen our compensation and incentive programs.","We've talked about how we are increasing the granularity of bonus programs, tying them much closer results individuals deliver, and based in part on shareholder input, the board's compensation and leadership development committee has modified the performance stock program to include relative sales growth metrics and a total shareholder return modifier to ensure awards reflect performance versus external competitive benchmarks.","We also explore an additional opportunities to adjust incentive comp to drive greater accountability, including increase the amount of compensation at risk and more closely linking incentives to team and individual performance. And while the current environment presents several challenges we are making progress, we are delivering our financial objectives and we remain committed to improve results in baby and grooming while advancing our strategic priorities and continuing to drive productivity.","Again, it is not business as usual and we are taking the additional steps to drive change. Our efforts to focus and strengthen our portfolio to extend our margin of competitive superiority to transform our supply chain to enhance our industry-leading margins and to simplify our organizational structure and increased accountability are all clearly aimed at delivering balanced top and bottom-line growth to create value over the short, mid and long-term.","And with that, Jon and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Clearly, there are a number of near-term dynamics at play that I'm sure will be in focus throughout the call, pricing and the Merck acquisition probably front and center. But David, I wanted to take advantage of you being here and just step back for a minute, building on some of the comments you just made because when I think back to when you came as the CEO in late '15, you have a definite vision to return P&G to stable, profitable and market share positive growth at the risk of over oversimplify. I think calendar '16 was to be investment year, '17 a year of stabilization, and '18 a year of acceleration toward sustainability going forward. I mean even just six months to nine months ago, the plan was very publicly said to be working and we were supposed to be accelerating into the fiscal year end. So while I appreciate the incremental call to action today, it just feels that with the results today and the updated outlook, we're just a good ways away from that outcome? And I guess the question is 2.5 years in, how do you -- how does the board, how is the rest of the management team assess just the overall state of P&Gs turnaround? And from here, what's the definition of success and how long should investors expect to wait just to get there? So I think we all get the external challenges and we definitely appreciated the organization's efforts today, but at the same time we've been expecting more from the investments made these past two years. I'd just love your perspective.","David Taylor","Just a couple of comments. One I would say, we had -- we have today a meaningful acceleration on eight of our businesses, and I feel good about those. Eight of our businesses are now growing over 3% and the profits are very strong. Core EPS on those selected that part of the business would be strong. We had two that have clearly been a bigger challenge than we anticipated that I anticipated. The steps that we are taking are showing signs, but it\u2019s taking longer. And that\u2019s going to require more change and more interventions, and we are taking those in each one of the brand country combinations in both baby and grooming to get them turned.","What I\u2019ve seen though that I think reinforces that P&G is turning is just the breadth of brands, countries that are showing now strong growth, and it is showing up in share with the exception of in those two categories. I don\u2019t think investors should wait very long. I expect next year that we will turn. And I think right now the critical part is to ensure that Baby Care and Grooming execute their plans and the interventions that are planned and that we also continue to make and we will continue to make changes as needed as new market realities come forward.","The last six months we\u2019ve seen improvements in many really important areas and as P&G getting in a very real way into the natural segment. P&G addresses some of the fastest growing segments. Now, it\u2019s in the first time in many years where we\u2019re starting to see majority of our top 20 markets turning. China is growing now in the mid singles as we said it would, Japan, strong growth in the mid to high singles. Majority of our top 15 to 20 markets are turning. So we do have some issues, we understand them and we are making additional interventions to address them.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I wanted to ask a little bit about the ongoing inventory destocking and that\u2019s seemingly not just in the U.S. We're compings some big destocking, it was an issue last quarter as well. Clearly we keep track of what retailers are having to say. Those are wondering to what degree this is reflecting specific dynamics with some elements of your P&G specific portfolio, not just overall industry destock, whether it\u2019s like you mentioned -- you mentioned Harry's by name but Harry's getting distribution at Walmart, if there\u2019s some shelf base loss for Gillette. Retailers making efforts with private label, what happening with shelf space there? And maybe even in beauty where you\u2019ve got retailers like sourcing their own product in terms of disruptor and upstart brands and may be pressuring some legacy shelf space. So I just was curious about that as a dynamic more than just retailer trying to manage inventory for their own efficiency but it\u2019s really a statement around how the brands are performing and what takeaway is looking like?","David Taylor","I\u2019ll give a comment and Jon, if you have any to jump in there. If I look just at the U.S., recently we\u2019ve turned to kind of right at flat and actually its plus 0.1. Your comments there were very fair. We have seen a couple of dynamics that I think you\u2019re hearing from us and probably some others, the pressure on retailer trade much is real. The pressure in increased emphasis on private label is very real. The dissolution of that is innovation that grows categories and that I think we\u2019re actually well positioned, but we have to do even more. And as we\u2019ve done it, we have certainly seeing progress.","I don\u2019t believe that the end of just the modest inventory reductions is everybody works very hard to improve the supply chains, and we anticipate that and we're looking at that next year. We have seen more adjustments than planned this year as we commented on. The key to me though in each one of these categories is where we've demonstrated we can bring new ideas, not mentioned before the Fabric Care example where we come in with whether it\u2019s unstoppable so whether it's coming with just based laundry upgrades or new line extensions, we've been able to grow the category growth share, the challenge is in all these categories to do the same.","After several years, we've seen Olay really start to take hold both in U.S. and China, but what's required was a rethinking of the communication model of our in-store presentation and in many cases new items that appeal to consumers. The most recent launch is doing extremely well. So, I believe category by category, you have to look at and while there is some inventory destocking, I believe the fundamental winning and losing will be determined by do you have a consumer proposition that is preferred and do you have a customer propositions that grows the category and helps create more margin.","And there's a lot of pressure on that right now as the profit pool is being pressured because the dynamics that exist that you're well aware of both from discounters and from the e-commerce side and we'll have to deal with that.","Jon Moeller","There is one other thing, Lauren, that we're actually well proactively contributing to this inventory reduction and that's the supply chain transformation that David talked about, and with our ability now to source, to have 80% of our sales source within 24 hours from production to shelf, there's less system inventory that's required and that's a good thing over periods of time. So, there is that element of contributing as well. And that's certainly U.S. dynamic but increasingly a dynamic in other parts of the world, as we transform the supply chain to better serve our customer base.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","So David, your comment in the release about the ecosystems in which you operate being disrupted and transformed, and some of commentary on the call and your presence all seems to be highlighting a change in tone. And I guess my question to you would be, do you think there's been a material change in the profit growth outlook for the categories that P&G competes in, in the U.S. and globally versus what you would have expected a couple years ago? I mean you're pointing to some problems in baby and grooming, but you had negative pricing in every single division this quarter that's despite a commodity spike. That's not the way branded CPG companies are supposed to operate, you know organic sales is weakening despite a lot of that great internal work you've done to strengthen the organization over the last few years. And what I'd argue is that theoretically great macro environment for the U.S. consumer in what's a key geography for you? So I just want to understand would you agree there has been a change in the sort of profit growth algorithm for the industry or the categories you're in? And then, how does that affect your expectations for P&G's longer term EPS growth? B, willingness to invest behind the business? And C, the capital allocation decisions in terms of if M&A and diversification plays a greater role going forward? I know I'm cheating and asking multiple questions, but I think they're all related and important for your shareholders, so thank you.","David Taylor","You did ask many big questions, I'll give comments. Jon will comment and we'll see, if we can some of this. What is clear is what it takes to win has gotten more difficult, do I believe that the profit availability has changed dramatically? No, and then look at some of our probably highest margin and part of the business to invest, but there is SK-II in West Coast where our total beauty business is making very good progress. Our Fabric Care business globally and in the U.S. is making very good progress.","And I think what it takes it's got more difficult and then I mean that should actually favor overtime companies that have tremendous technology and can differentiate through a dimensioned superiority that matters to consumers on the five elements. But I\u2019ve got my eyes wide open that it\u2019s going to take additional funding to make that happen and that\u2019s why we do have to change faster. I am on the call because; one, I think the healthcare change is a meaningful positive step; and secondly, I want to be very clear it is not business as usual P&G.","But it's not because anyway does it take away from the future it actually just reinforce how we\u2019ve made the choice that we\u2019re going to make additional changes to accelerate and get back on positive share growth, top line growth and bottom line growth. There are many things that are working very well on the Company a few are not in those, we\u2019re not going to work that kind of that we\u2019re growing through some tough challenges right now.","But the fundamental strategy owing through some tough challenges right now with the fundamental strategy and the profit potential, I think are very much still there, just requires faster moves and we\u2019re one of the common on this and just illustrates. We have many questions a year ago on China because we come off a very difficult time and there we did have to move in a different way than the past a number of capabilities directly in the market and what we see there is almost instant reaction from the minus five to plus one to the plus six. In the U.S., we\u2019ve got many categories also turning. You have a dynamic in Baby Care that is very difficult and we\u2019re addressing it.","We haven\u2019t had a dynamic a year ago and Shape Care and we\u2019re addressing that and you will start to see the last one to three months meaningful improvements. If you got consumers coming in and you\u2019ve got innovation that is the write down, we\u2019ve seen consumers are willing to pay interestingly the fastest growing segment is around most parts of the world are premium, super premium, new forms and naturals.","All of those till that carry very good profit margins and very good growth rates. We do have to continue to transform our portfolio to increase the percent of our business in those forms and one example that\u2019s playing out across the world is pants and diapers, even though it\u2019s been a difficult category I am very pleased that we\u2019re leading a fastest growing segment the consumers around the world are choosing for their babies.","Jon Moeller","I think the only thing I would add to that, Dara, is our two points. David made a point in his prepared remarks, so I think is very important the talks to the benefits of noticeable superiority, packaging products and communication of the market et cetera, and where we have that right. We\u2019re delivering our business objectives all the way from household penetration to market share to profit growth the vast majority of the time. And where we don\u2019t have that right is very clear we\u2019re not delivering against those objectives. So that\u2019s not a macro dynamic and that scenario that\u2019s holding us back, its increasing the level of advantage that we need to with our current portfolio which as David said we\u2019re going to use productivity to help fund.","The other perspective I give you and this is not in any way an excuse, its perspective on whether it\u2019s a systemic issue here on not in any way an excuse its perspective on whether there is a systemic issue here or not from a market level standpoint to the point of the your question. If you look at as David mentioned this earlier as well. If you look at sales growth, excluding baby and drilling where we know we have work to do we\u2019re 3% fiscal year-to-date, profit growth 9% fiscal year-to-date. So, there is nothing as we look at the totality of the portfolio that indicates to us that those kind of results aren't available on a broader basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","So, I guess the question and maybe Jon you can answer this on category growth. How that's looking relative to where we were the last time you have the call three months ago? And if there's any way you can give us context between volume and pricing because it looks like pricing has broadly been deteriorating across the entire industry? And just related to that, I know you've talked a lot about the competition and it seems like the immerging markets, the local players are becoming much more sophisticated and much more of a nuisance for you guys and other multinational companies. So just wanted to understand either changing anyway you're making decisions to help compete against those local companies a bit more effectively?","David Taylor","So let me comment on the market growth dynamics and will have David, comment on how were responding to evolving competitive realities. Market growth in the last quarter was essentially unchanged in aggregate from when we last talked last quarter. It's about 2.5% in our categories that's comprised of mid-singles and developing markets and low singles in developed markets. So, that's the status on market growth, of pricing, as I talked briefly about in my prepared remarks has also essentially unchanged versus when we last talked that is 30 basis points of additional price. But I don't think and clearly I mean I guess the retail dynamics that are recurring there is pressure on price, but where we can bring meaningful benefits superiority to market, we're seeing the ability to price. Pods or a premium priced item, these are premium priced. The Naturals elements items that we're bringing to market are premium price. So to the innovator, there continues to be a pricing opportunity.","Jon Moeller","And let me point a little bit on the emerging markets, we are always trying because this is the biggest one that have the most comprehensive data on that, and I would just spend some time going through that markets carefully with the team. We have and if I look at to kind of where we are losing share we will gain share, you're absolutely right the greatest share losses and difficult periods have been kind of all other companies are local and regional competitors. But even that I have seen change over the last, if I go back two years ago the year ago to more recently, and it takes almost category-by-category FemCare definitely was being hit by Hang On which is a local competitor and some other local competitors.","We were indexing from four years between 94 and 95 index, in fiscal '16, '17, we grew modestly to 105. We're right now tracking this fiscal year above the 115. Why? We put the pure cotton product out there. We've got the right -- it's the whole lineup is right now and the team has just done a beautiful job one by one understanding the consumer we had to re-staff in a way we are in addition to a strong team adding the capability to make decisions on the ground and that included another more fully functional capability there and we assign people from this center to the market.","The same thing happened in Olay which were for many years, if go back to '14 to '15 and '15 to '16 with index in the 90s. This year's can be above 110, and it's showing it can accelerate now what's happened is that it had new some things additional to what we're doing in the rest of the market because you are right, local and regional competitors are doing a lot of stuff in the market. I will draw a distinction between where they may be some share gains and where people are creating value and sustaining that.","We are showing, again, whether it\u2019s FemCare, Oral Care or Personal Care business, one by one getting better and which is why in aggregate is 6 and actually Mainland China is a little better than that. That's our Greater China unit. Mainland China is 1 point above that, as we can win against a very aggressive set of competitors. What\u2019s different is the innovation cycle is much shorter. The speed of decisions has to be faster and we\u2019ve had to reorganize to make that happen. That\u2019s part of the end-to-end but go much more aggressively in China. India, which is another market, is very, very difficult.","And you see the India market where the whole world went through the too big transitions last year, we\u2019re now double-digit this year doing the same thing, making sure we have the right go-to-market capability for that specific market and then making sure we\u2019ve got superior consumer preferred both products. And one of the biggest changes is getting more latitude to the market to adjust the communication to meet and communicate with the local consumer. So actually I do believe that has been but I\u2019ve got a lot of evidence we can win in China and India, the two biggest markets who are now starting to grow and growing at an accelerating pace as we go through the fiscal year.","Jon Moeller","And I think as well just reflecting on China for a second to your question, Nik about price potential on a global basis. I mean that\u2019s a market we\u2019re at a market level. The premium and super premium tiers are more than 100% of the growth of the market, which continues to be very attractive in total. And our business as well in that market David mentioned Feminine Care is growing fastest at the premium portion of the market. So as we look globally, there continues to be significant opportunities for growth from a sales standpoint and doing that very profitably.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, I had a couple of questions but they are short and discrete, probably that\u2019s okay. First of all, the private label growth in the diaper market in U.S., are you seeing that more in-store or is that an Amazon phenomenon? Number two, is the fact that you\u2019re buying the Merck business, does that mean or imply or suggest that you won\u2019t be buying a big piece of the Pfizer business? And then third question is just on the guidance for pricing to remain negative and aggregate for the next several quarters but the gross margin is supposed to be up in the fourth quarter if I heard that right. Does it seem strange to me not only given the negative pricing but all the commodity inflation we\u2019re seeing. So can you explain from a productivity initiative perspective like what\u2019s the light switch that goes on in the fourth quarter that\u2019s going to get gross margins up?","David Taylor","On private label?","Jon Moeller","Yes, private label what we are seeing is an acceleration of support, I am seeing more but actually in-store in some of our retailers and I think in part due to defending versus the lead on holiday launches that have continued to expand. And because of the importance of that consumer, both all the retailers recognized getting the young mom is important for the basket. And because the profitability pressure, there is a lot of movement there. What we have to do in our doing is making sure our products preferred and that\u2019s the way best to win versus private label and we\u2019ve demonstrated that in Europe over a decade and we\u2019re going to have to sharpen and speed up in terms of some of the changes that we are making to make sure we win with the U.S. consumer.","But it is I think a reaction to two dynamics both online and the discounter moves that occurred in the last year, but baby diapers specifically it\u2019s disproportionate off-line versus online. So Amazon, for example, is not a huge dynamic in that category other than as David said it's influencing the behavior of other retailers. In terms of your question on pricing and commodity inflation and productivity and gross margin, pricing will remain a negative impact to top line for the next quarter that's as far as we guided at this point other than I do expect it to turn positive sometime next year. The amount of the impact should lessen over time and one of the big drivers Wendy is simply that we annualize the big Gillette U.S. pricing reduction starting now.","Also productivity as we've talked about tends to be back-loaded so increases as the year progresses and bring on additional savings, David mentioned for example the start of production in West Virginia and so I feel reasonably confident that we can grow gross margins in the face of a continued price impact on the top line albeit at lower levels. Sorry, you also asked, this is the trouble with multipart questions is I forget. You also asked about acquisitions and as you will readily appreciate positively or negatively that's not a topic we comment on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","I've got some few potential questions on the table, but I want to come back to the pricing one. The narrative of premium tiers driving growth isn't really new nor is the narrative of you upgrading your portfolio and intervening into those premium tiers? And yet, it clearly results your price mix is eroding and if you look at Nielsen down the U.S., you sold more promotion the U.S. last quarter than any time last five years. And obviously costs, your European competitors facing FX historically this has been fairly counter your pricing. So from the outside looking in, it seems like you're chasing a price value equation lower in the wake of all this disruption that you're talking about on the retail side, the competitive front as well, none of that disruption looks like it's poised to abate anytime soon. So why should we expect price to improve going forward? Why shouldn't we be assuming that this is sort of a new reality and maybe looking to address the business model the cost structure more aggressively to adapt to this new reality?","David Taylor","I'd say there is some element of new reality there, Jason. I think that's a very valid point. And as David said, this is not business as usual, so were changing everything to adapt to that new reality, whether it's entering segments that are new segments that also carry premium prices that are going fast like the natural segment. We talked about ever-increasing levels of productivity to be able to allow us to continue to invest while holding and building margins $200 million to $300 million ahead of our going in target this year and I expect we will have a very aggressive plan next year as well. So we want to be prepared to win in a scenario where this is a continuing dynamic, but again in many parts of the world it\u2019s a very different market reality and in those markets we need to position ourselves to win with those consumers.","Jason English","The only thing reinforced and maybe I haven\u2019t, it is clearly communicated as I want to, we do recognize changes must be made and the cost structure demands are real into more than the past period. That\u2019s real and what we had anticipated is not sufficient therefore we need to do more. I do believe that the strategy is right. What is going to take to bring it to life and deliver the outcome we want, means we\u2019re going to have to do more things differently than we\u2019ve done before and we look at some choices we\u2019ve made to make sure that we\u2019re making immediate progress over the timeframe we\u2019re talking and to me right now that is going on in the Company and will continue to go the Company because there is a reality that you\u2019d got whether it's in the discount or is the e-commerce and retailers are working hard to make sure they get their share of the value created in an industry and the winners is going to the ones that have products consumers. Weren\u2019t more than anything and once they can help grow margins and to do that we\u2019re going to have to have more investment available and that\u2019s got to come through our cost structure?","David Taylor","And this also isn\u2019t a dynamic that\u2019s new. We\u2019ve talked before about for example what happens when the discounter expanded in Europe and private label shares grew significantly as a percentage of the market in Europe over the last 20 years and our business has went through peace in valleys and it wasn\u2019t an easy adjustment but we made the adjustments we needed to make and our business has performed very well in that context building share and the vast majority of our big brands and categories in Europe over that period of time. That\u2019s no guarantee for success with the current dynamic in the U.S. We certainly don\u2019t approach it that way but it's also a reason to believe that it can be done.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","David, you went through a number of initiatives around baby, grooming and a few other categories. Most of the moves they're seemed to be around pricing and promotion, less around products. So as a market leader in the majority of your categories, why do you think that these are the right moves? And why do you believe they\u2019re not potentially contributing to taking even more dollars out of these categories? And if I could just follow up on earlier question on margins, lot of pressure right now on gross margin obviously and those pressures seem to be growing maybe pricing less than July action slab but you\u2019ve got negative mix, the freight issue et cetera that you\u2019re dealing with. Do you think that there is enough productivity benefits next year to offset these to get gross margin expansion as we look at the fiscal \u201919?","David Taylor","Well first, we will make pricing adjustments where we\u2019re lost consumer value but that is not how we lead, that\u2019s not our lead strategy. Our strategy is to drive consumer and actually trade consumers up and then in Baby Care the fastest growing segments are pants and premium trait. What we have to do and are doing is innovating on those platforms what has taken more time then I would want is to get a platforms in place in the cost optimize as we get winning products out. In pants, the product is winning and we\u2019re growing share in the categories growing fast. We\u2019ve got a large inst all business on mainline across many countries and that segment is under tremendous pressure and you are right, that part of the business is very price sensitive.","And as we get more and more of our portfolio in the premium and super premium segments, we actually insulate ourselves from some of the issues that you\u2019re talking. The same is true on Gillette as we continue to trade people up than we have stronger profitability where we were missing and what required this intervention was we were losing too many users and over the long-term that is a real problem and so we had to strengthen our innovation on all three tiers, disposables the mid-tier systems which is marked and the premium systems which is the fusion.","Family, each of those have innovations in the past we only invented at the high end the risk in that as you lose users and losing users overtime was the issue that lead to the intervention that on, but on categories our pricing interventions are meant to be very competitive our strategy to win is on premium super premium superior products.","Jon Moeller","And on your question on margins, we're just in the beginning phases of putting our plans together for next year, Olivia, so I don't want to provide specific guidance, but our objective clearly will be to continue our margin growth on both the gross and operating margin line and we will be just as we did this year looking to increase the level of productivity savings that we can bring to bear in that situation, and I expect as well if the commodity trends continue that there will be pricing in some categories and some markets to help offset this as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So because there are two for topics M&A and obviously kind of your core business, maybe I'll indulge with the two questions. One is on the M&A, why is this the right time to do the Merck OTC deal in both Merck KG OTC deal? So many other thing is going on it was not a cheap valuation as some would argue, it doesn't really move the needle. Was it really that the kind of Teva either pulling out or you guys are excited that JV doesn\u2019t work is that really kind of precipitate this is the first question? And then the second question, building on some the things we've been talking about. I guess I'm wondering what plan B and you may say it's too early to talk about that, but look less as there is little bit drama but acquisition for sure and it comes up to be more smaller compelling pack of change if any guy do a really good job your market organization in terms of talking about change but why not if we can make much films about it and the actual numbers aren't good, right. You're pricing guides were down 2% and this is after a quarters and quarters and quarters the accommodation and no price wars when we heard children that this question we really just ask this question. And by the way it only becomes positive it sounds like sometime in that fiscal year and towards the pricing but that doesn\u2019t feel good. You said look we are 8 out of 10 are good, and two of them are not good into your categories but there is always through they are not good right. I mean it just seems like there is always something at P&G as some calorie combinations are doing well which impacts the whole business it hasn\u2019t come together we get that but I guess why will it now continues to be the question we ask and if you look at as that business is neutral but we have heard some form and that business is real for at least five years. So I guess what if the strategy doesn\u2019t work, what if the world is actually two dramatically different HPC you start look like packaged foods for investors perspective what is Plan B. One of the things you guys think about as a record option as I just don\u2019t innovate is it shakes your headcounts by 80% not 25%. Are you just going to have excess and we're going to have expected all of your earning. I really want to get underneath this Plan B part as well please?","David Taylor","So, let me take this last questions and commentary there. First on is this the right time. This was a very good transition that Teva and you\u2019re probably with the situation right now with Teva and our discussion with Teva, it was clear that the ongoing future of the JV needed change and that\u2019s been one of the strongest parts of the business.","At the same time, Merck complements what we have and strengthens what is left once we separate from Teva. It gives us a better geographic footprint. It gives us some additional therapeutic areas. They are growing in the mid to high single-digits. When you put the two together, and this transition, it gives us a stronger business in a category that\u2019s got attractive margins and strong growth rate. It\u2019s a positive mix for the Company.","If you looked on a go forward basis, and these things happen when they happen and those opportunity and I am very pleased we got this done. I think it\u2019s very positive for P&G shareholders in the future. And we don\u2019t pick the timing on when all these things happen, there\u2019s other parties involved. But when it does, you get it done, you get done it right.","The second one is you have many, many questions and some comments and there just a comment on there\u2019s always some business certainly recognize that and to our history there\u2019s always been some businesses up and down. We have two particularly large businesses that have had particularly meaningful perks. The changes over the last couple of years show a level of breadth that indicates P&G can win across a wide range of markets and a wide range of categories.","I completely accept that we must improve to aggregate P&G company top, bottom and share, cash performance has been very strong. And we are making the interventions to do that. Will we look at more significant interventions and how we\u2019re organized in taking cost out? We\u2019ve already addressed that. Yes, we will in ways to create the productivity savings in order to make the interventions needed.","I don\u2019t think there is a broad HPC industry can\u2019t win or can\u2019t generate value, I don\u2019t buy that scenario. And I believe it\u2019s just incumbent upon the leaders in the categories to come up in the innovation that does create value. And there\u2019s periods you go through in a category they're difficult, and the winners are the ones that come out with fundamentals that are strong consumer preferred products. And it has to be done even more than in the past in a way where the retailer sees category growth and margin growth.","And that requires again additional productivity to fund it. And what we are doing is adjusting and in some cases going to have to do a meaningful additional effort to make that happen.","David Taylor","And just back to timing on Merck, we\u2019ve been trying to communicate this morning that we realized that we are operating in a world that is changing and we need to change with it. And we can\u2019t in that context ignore work or complexity that we take on in order to make those changes. And one of those changes has been and will continue to be increasingly attractiveness of the footprint of the portfolio. And OTC is a very attractive space for us. This opportunity became available. We embrace the change opportunity that it represented, both the sun-setting of the JV, which has been very successful and this new opportunity. And we\u2019ll continue across our activity system to take on necessary change to improve outcomes.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","David just sticking with the topic of M&A and of course I appreciate you won't comment on specific asset that was brought up earlier, but in light of this acquisition and many of the challenges that have been discussed does M&A play an increasing role in the capital allocation strategy to move into categories that are growing faster particularly than some that are challenging the existing portfolio. I was hoping you could touch on your M&A criteria maybe the appetite for potentially larger deals. Maybe that's not what the Company needs at this point I think there's some merit to that argument and then potential categories, geographies of interest and just the last part of that just given the significant amount of portfolio pruning which has happened over the past several years. Can you just confirm that the areas of interest are only within Proctor's existing ten that are in the portfolio at this point of time?","David Taylor","What I would say you know there's so much I could say about future and about M&A, the core growth will come from organic sales and profit growth within our existing portfolio. We are open as demonstrated by the announcement today, where we see an opportunity create value, especially if it causes us to play in a category that is very attractive to demographics and the structural profitability and I'd just we stay very open. I think you also said, we're looking a lot outside our ten categories. The key is to stay focused on the 10 but look for ways and they're maybe some adjacencies that leverage core capabilities of the Company and for those I would be open as well. But again, it's not a C shift to say primarily driven by growth by inorganic approaches, no but a level of openness probably that's more in the past because we finished the portfolio pruning, and now we believe each category ought to be active managers in the portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I just have a quick question regarding you know macro indicators such as consumer confidence really are at or near highs but category growth still remains quite weak, so could you guys help reconcile this for us and better understand the disconnect between these factors.","David Taylor","The category growth varies widely, it stayed strong in China it's picked up in India. The U.S. has been difficult and part of that is aggressive pricing action is taken place with some of the dynamics we talked before, between online and offline and a couple of big highly contested categories with Baby Care being the best example I can think of where many are after that consumer and have been willing to price pretty aggressively even different from what we may sell to them. And that kind of goes up and down.","I do believe in most markets around the world we're seeing actually stable to anything slightly improving and that's because of the progress in India has been a big plus. A couple markets and Jon mentioned one earlier that has been a real challenge, markets like Saudi, it contracted a great deal and that's by a choice by the government to focus on the Saudization and the diversification of the economy and we've seen that hit both Saudi and it's had the impact on the Gulf states.","And there's always been volatility in Africa, but if a look at Europe, stable, if anything slightly improving. The U.S. in terms of volume is stable and in some categories improving. Pricing is difficult right now. And Brazil, the outlook by most would be improving in the future, difficult the last few years coming out of two years of a severe recession. Mexico is stable and pretty solid. And who knows, I think Russia is impacted pretty heavily by some external events that are going on right now.","But I don\u2019t see a weakening of the global consumer demand, if anything probably just sequentially a modest improvement outside of the U.S. and stably in U.S.","Operator","Next we will go to Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Grant on for Bill. We just had a question on the Grooming segment and kind of the entrants of that value-tiered player into large U.S. retailer. Here\u2019s our question is more on to that player entered into another U.S. retailer this past year. And I was wondering what impact of that was on your business then, maybe if there\u2019s any additional pricing pressure forward -- going forward due to that entrant in that retailer?","David Taylor","The entrant that is going through a novel and is right, already present, when they first came was coincident or actually right before, we took the pricing action. And the issue was we were not serving consumers in the below $10 price range. We didn\u2019t have what we needed at the $799 to $999 price point, so then came into one of the large U.S. retailers and it did have an impact. Post the intervention we\u2019ve made as we said our volume has picked up. Though we enter this next phase, while it still will be a challenge, we have the portfolio now where we have key price points covered.","We have got innovation going in across disposables to mid tiers to bring in systems and we are in a much better place to compete. And we are also taking aggressive defensive actions to make sure that we communicate with our consumers. In fact the volume is improving is a positive sign. The fact that even the past one in three month value shares have improved is positive. We will have another challenge when they first enter and -- but we\u2019re in a very different competitive place in grooming and our eyes are wide open this time to make sure we defend our business aggressively.","The same is true on some of the online entrants in Europe. This time we are going to defend our business and work to keep our consumers and certainly attract consumers that are interested in online experiences. We recognize that competitive environment will continue to be challenging, all that just means acceleration, make changes that are needed and if what you\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t work, be open to new ideas and we are.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","David, you mentioned the user base in grooming a couple of times and I\u2019ve to come to you in the Q&A, the need to hold on to these users. I mean what if it's a case that fragmentation is just natural here and kind of users who want a more low end experience just are your -- aren't great 20-year Gillette and that there\u2019s going to be a next wave of innovation that takes care of this and what you need is higher prices and higher value and to pull consumers up. I mean I know that sounds like pie in the sky at this pint with all these entrants. But I also observe that doing this for 17 years in food, beverage, HPC, I can\u2019t think of a time when absolutely dominant and global leader with a price premium has kind of heal by category by taking price and profit out of it. But that's scared that's basically restored order and by the way what's happening. What is if that makes you walk the user base to be higher at the expense of profit? And what data do you see that makes you think that's the right answer?","David Taylor","I think there is a good set of data if you in Gillette specifically, if the consumers enter Gillette, I'll call it that their portfolio ladder has been lot of evidenced that they experience better and what they were using before at whatever price here and then we can expose them to the next level up in performance and consumers move up. And so what was problematic was if you're losing too many new consumers, certainly a time where there is some societal trends around the frequency of shaving.","You put those two together and said we're not going to sit by and watch the significant portion of new users, more millennial consumers not been exposed to Gillette and get on habits that one don\u2019t given the best consumer experience and secondly would compromise the brand. So their maybe interventions it did bring the volume back and again we've got a lot of evidenced overtime and you think about almost any category you get in, if you are pleased with the performance of the product when you enter you opening to ideas from that ideas and products from that brand.","It is to be a losing strategy to have a smaller and smaller group of consumers playing more and more and believe that will continue and grow your business at acceptable rate. And that's why we want to play in the premium and super premium, but we also have an appropriate entry in most of our categories to bring consumers in and then given the delightful experiences that they are happy to pay more. And that's true and than in the 8 of the 10 categories working.","It's also why we start early in with pampers with great products, but we also have Loves or mid-tier as we want to be present to bring consumers in, but then once they are into anyone of our brand franchises have a meaningfully better experience, and give them the choice as the world is trading up and we have a lot of average overtime, a lot of categories that they will, but you have to be price competitive at the point the consumer invest in the category.","Operator","And now your final question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Just want to go back to the shift in emphasis to private label on the part of retailers in certain categories I actually get the fact that you see better margins for them, but it's always been brands that really drive traffic. Is that a commentary on the impact on this of innovation by branded players like yourself in certain categories? Or does the consumer simply value product performance differently today than they did three or five years ago?","David Taylor","I don\u2019t think there is a fundamental difference in the consumers valuing from seeing private-label different and I think private label has improve their quality, and I think we have to maintain the level of advantage and justify as the price premium and it is simple as that. When we do that and do that well and we got all kinds of examples. We're able to earn the consumer's trust and the additional cost is actually a good value for them. I expect the private-label manufacturers will continue to and what they generally do is look what the large manufactures are doing or the branded players and they will add new features and we need to be innovative in bringing new ideas and meaningfully better performance.","It is so fundamental to why the strategy of meaningful superiority has to be implemented. In the categories where we've done that we're seeing just what you want to see and we want to see. The top line growth that grow share, bottom line growth that creates value in higher single digits, we've got a few where that isn't the case and if you have a very long and that has weighted down the Company, but when achieved the strategy works. The challenge is to achieve it more consistently, in more brands, across more countries. And while we have those, we have a few big rocks still to move and we've been very open about what those are and we're willing to take additional actions and we will take additional actions to make sure we have the funding and the capability to make that happen.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17640":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 23, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","David Taylor - President & CEO","Jon Moeller - Vice Chairman & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank","Andrea Teixeira - JP Morgan","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Steve Strycula - UBS","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Caroline Levy - Macquarie","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter-End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. Additionally, the Company has posted on it's Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. We'll keep our prepared remarks fairly brief today, reflecting a fairly straightforward quarter and the upcoming Deutsche Bank Conference in Paris. We'll provide result headlines, comment briefly on strategic focus areas and update guidance for the fiscal year before turning to your questions.","January-March top line growth was strong with organic sales growing 5%, driven by volume, pricing and mix. 8 of 10 categories grew organic sales; skin and personal care again grew in the teens; Feminine Care and Home Care, high singles; Fabric Care, Family Care, Hair Care, Oral Care and Personal Healthcare each grew mid-single digits. We delivered strong organic sales growth in our two largest markets: the U.S. up 4%, China up 11%. Organic growth was broad-based, equal to or ahead of year ago in 13 of our Top 15 markets with all six geographic regions growing organic sales five up mid-single digits or more. Ecommerce organic sales grew more than 20%.","Market share trends remain strong; 33 of our Top 50 country category combinations holding or growing value share of fiscal year to-date, up from 26% last fiscal year, 23% in fiscal '17, and 17% in fiscal '16. Some challenges do remain with Grooming and Baby Care, each down low singles. In total though consumption, volume, sales and shares each progressing nicely. In addition to very strong sales growth, we delivered strong constant currency earnings growth; core earnings per share was $1.06, up 6% versus the prior year, foreign exchange was at $245 million after-tax earnings headwind about $0.09 per share, still on a constant currency basis core earnings per share were up 15%.","The effective tax rate for the quarter came in at around 15.5%, due partly to favorable settlement of prior period audits. A portion of this benefit was initially expected in the April to June period. The tax rate also reflects benefits from higher actual tax deductions on stock option exercises versus deferred taxes booked through option vesting. Core gross margin improved sequentially to flat versus year ago despite FX and commodity cost headwinds. On a currency neutral basis, core gross margin increased 60 basis points. SG&A costs and percentage of sales were up versus year ago driven in part by the addition of Merck, including temporary integration cost.","For the balance of the company, SG&A as a percentage of sales increased modestly due to increased traditional, digital and social media investments. On a constant currency basis, core operating profit grew 7%.","On top of the sales and earnings growth, cash flow remains strong with free cash flow productivity of 100%. $3.1 billion of cash was returned to share owners, approximately $1.3 billion of share repurchased and $1.9 billion of dividends. We announced a 4% increase in the dividend earlier this month, the 63rd consecutive annual increase and 129th consecutive year in which P&G has paid a dividend. P&G is one of only 10 U.S. companies to pay a dividend for more than 120 consecutive years. Only three U.S. companies have increased dividends more consecutive years than P&G. Over the last 10 years, the annual dividend has increased from $1.64 to $2.90 per share, returning $67 billion of cash dividends to shareholders over those 10 years.","In summary, a strong quarter, solid consumption, volume and organic sales growth driving positive market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong constant currency core earnings per share growth, a continued best-in-class track record of cash return to share owners. All of these delivered while working to address some significant category-specific challenges and against a difficult competitive and macro landscape. We continue to accelerate change in our program of constructive disruption to meet the challenges we still face and to further improve results from here.","As you know, we've made several important strategic choices which are enabling the progress we're making; one was to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily use categories where performance drives brand choice. In categories where we occupy a number one or two position, which have historically grown faster than the balance of the company and are more profitable, this choice is clearly paying out. Within these categories, again, categories where performance drives brand choice, we've taken a deliberate step to invest in and advance the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing and value, growing the markets in which we compete and strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands.","We used to spend a lot of time together discussing these advances in the U.S. and China, but they're global in nature. Let's take a look at a few examples in Europe where we have built P&G aggregate share by 20, 30 and 50 basis points over the last 12, 6 and 3 month periods respectively. In Europe, our growth in fabric care is driving category growth of 4%, led by the strength of consumer-preferred products such as Ariel and PODS. Ariel superiority has delivered nearly a point of share growth in Europe Fabric Care against very favorable local competition offering consumers superior performance and convenience.","Fairy auto-dishwashing is driving mid-single-digit category growth behind superior premium price innovation, Fairy Platinum. Fairy is delivering double-digit organic sales growth with share up more than 200 basis points. We just launched a new upgrade, Fairy Platinum Plus in the March quarter. Platinum Plus delivers the outstanding cleaning performance Fairy consumers expect with added anti-dullness technology to keep the finish on dishes looking like new. Early results of Platinum Plus are strong and are further strengthening category growth.","In Feminine Care, our super premium innovation Always Infinity is driving western European market growth in the pad segment. And Always Discreet continues to drive market growth in the adult incontinence category. In total, Always Feminine Care share is up over 0.5 point year-to-date as we continue to build and expand our advantages in each superiority vector. European Oral Care is driving market growth and strong organic sales growth, led by high single digit growth of Oral B powered brushes.","We recently launched Gillette's SkinGuard Razors in Western Europe. SkinGuard is designed to delight the 70% of men who report skin sensitivity which causes many of them to shave less frequently. By addressing this unmet consumer need with superior performing product, we're creating the opportunity to increase usage, building the category and building share for P&G. After just a few months in market the razor systems category has accelerated to double digit growth in France, Germany and the UK with Gillette growing a few points ahead of the market.","We've talked a lot about product and packaging superiority, a little bit less about communication of value and very little about retail execution superiority; a key driver of our accelerated growth results. In the recently published 2018 global advantage monitor report which is an independent retailer assessment of manufacturers across seven key performance areas: strategic alignment, people, category development, consumer marketing, trade and shopper marketing, supply chain, and customer service, P&G ranked number one globally. We earned the highest number of number one country ratings; 12 in total including China, Japan, Mexico, Russia and the U.S., and we ranked number one in all 7 performance areas.","Omnichannel results were tabulated for the first time this past year. P&G was identified as the leading manufacturer overall with the number one position in the U.S., China, France and Turkey. P&G was recently recognized by Walmart U.S. as Supplier of the Year in consumables. The first time we've earned this distinction in more than a decade, driven by innovation that grows markets and increases margins and record service levels enabled by our supply chain transformation. We were also named Supplier of the Year by Walmart in Mexico, Japan and China. We've recently earned similar recognitions in the U.S. at Target, CVS and Family Dollar. We appreciate this recognition but what really matters is retailers' improved view of P&G as a partner in joint value creation which earns us stronger distribution, share of shelf, display and feature.","While we're making solid progress across the superiority drivers, we're working and investing to continue extending our margin of advantage, which will require additional investments. The need for this investment, the need to offset macro cost headwinds, and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth including margin expansion underscores the importance of productivity. We're driving cost savings and efficiency improvement in all facets of our business as a part of our second five-year $10 billion productivity program. We've consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. We're eliminating substantial ways in the media supply chain, delivering nearly $1 billion of savings and agency fees and ad production cost over the last four years. We see more savings potential in these areas along with more efficiency and effectiveness in media delivery.","We're continuing to drive savings in organization cost. Total enrollment including contractor positions is down about 30% since the start of our first productivity program. Through our productivity efforts, P&G has maintained and built it's status as a highly profitable company. Before tax operating margins are among the highest in the industry, behind only record in Colgate whose margins reflect our concentrations in healthcare. We have significant below-the-line advantages, operating with one of the lowest interest expense percentages and one of the lowest tax rates, putting us near the top of the industry in after tax margin -- all ready, highly profitable and aggressively driving more savings.","We're driving cost productivity and cash productivity with significant progress in all areas in working capital. Over the past five years, we've reduced receivables by 3 days, cut inventory by 10 days and increased payables by more than 30 days, enabling us to fund capital spending needed to transform our global supply chain while growing our dividend and maintaining an active share repurchase program. Over the last 7 fiscal years, we've averaged nearly 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, returning an average of over 110% of reported net earnings to share owners through a combination of dividend and share repurchase.","We're making organizational structure and closure [ph] changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization's structure, focus, effort, clarify responsibility, increase accountability. We're supplementing internal talent development with experienced external hiring and are improving category dedication and mastery. We're strengthening compensation in incentive programs to align with the organization's structure changes. We're leading the constructive disruption of our industry, leading innovation processes to improve speed to market, shots on goal and success rates of new products; monetizing internally developed technologies to build value and fund even more innovation investment; disrupting the brand building with digitally enabled one-to-one mass marketing; supply chain transformation enabled by robotic process automation; and leveraging digitization and data analytics to drive greater efficiency and effectiveness of all facets of our operations.","These portfolios, superiority, productivity, organization design and constructive disruption agendas are not independent strategies. They're reinforced and importantly build on each other. Together, they position us well on a relative basis within our industry to deal with nurturing challenges from macro headwinds, trade transformation and anticipated competitive response -- another foundation for stronger balance growth and value creation over the short, mid or long term.","Moving to guidance, I know we all hate to see it go, but with three strong quarters on the books averaging over 4% organic sales growth, we must regretfully abandon the low 2% end of our organic sales guidance range, increasing our organic sales growth outlook for the year to a solid 4%. We now expect All In sales growth in the range of in-line to up 1% versus last year, reflecting three to four points of negative points of foreign exchange. The net impact of acquisitions and investitures should have a modest positive impact on all end sales. We're maintaining our core earnings per share guidance range of 3% to 8% which translates to a range of 11% to 16% on a constant currency basis. This guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance range.","A little bit of perspective on the core EPS guidance. After three quarters, we're up 4.3%, more than a point below the middle of the fiscal year range. Our outlook for foreign exchange commodities, transportation and tariff impacts are unchanged, remaining at a combined $1.4 billion after tax headwind for the year. We now expect an effective tax rate for the year of 17% to 18%. Factor in higher option exercises, we now expect diluted shares outstanding to decrease by 1% for the fiscal year and Q4 diluted shares to be higher than last year by about 1%. We're increasing our outlook for free cash flow productivity to at least 100%, well above our going and target of 90%. We continue to expect within this CapEx spending the range of 5% to 5.5% of sales. This will be another year of strong cash return to shareholders, we expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase approximately $5 billion of shares in fiscal 2019.","I noted just a minute ago, this continues a long track record of significant cash generation and cash return to share owners, ultimately the most important and enduring measure of a successful enterprise. Over the last 10 years, P&G has generated more operating profit in cash than 98% of publicly listed companies around the world. Only three companies have returned the higher percentage of cash to share owners.","We won't provide specific guidance for the next fiscal year until our next earnings call on July 30, but want to provide a few preview points for your consideration. We're pleased with the top line momentum we've created, but we expect a strong competitive response and obviously the comps will be more difficult next year. Some of the unusual bottom line help we've had this year from the land sale and in tax are unlikely to repeat next year, so these will create tough earnings comparisons. FX commodities and transportation markets remain volatile. Media markets and retail shopping are being transformed. I expect as we sit here today, all of this will lead to fairly wide top and bottom line guidance ranges as we head into next year.","To sum up, we delivered our third strong quarter of the year, giving us confidence to raise sales and cash productivity targets. Efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organizational structure and increase accountability to constructively disrupt our industry, our driving improved results, but the external environment presents many challenges.","To address these challenges and further strengthen results, we continue to accelerate the pace of change. With that, I'm happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning, Jon. Clearly, there's a lot going on in your business and the global market. In that context, I guess I have a two-part question on your forward outlook. First, on your FY19 guidance. The momentum you're seeing in your business did prompt you to raise your organic sales growth guidance, but not your EPS and you did maintain the very wide range. You did touch on this, but could you drill down a little further for us on the key puts and takes of that? I guess that would help.","And then second, I was hoping to get your thoughts on the top line looking forward. This has really been a key question whether or not you're going to be able to sustain the higher level of organic sales growth over the long term, especially that you're going to start to lap more difficult comps. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense of your confidence level in your ability to deliver and then realistically if you expect shared gains to continue to accelerate, or do you think a more moderate level of top line growth going forward is more realistic? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Bonnie. On the current year bottom line, there's just a lot of -- let's just start with fiscal year to date. So we've gone through three quarters, we're at 4.3% as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. With only one quarter to go, that's relevant. Second, there's a lot of variability still in the environment, whether that's foreign exchange, commodities, transportation, geopolitical disruption, competitive response, et cetera, and we think it is even with one quarter to go, a bit misleading to give you a view of a very narrow guidance range. We also have a high degree of variability as you've seen in the current quarter from things like tax and it's not certain at this point that we'll be able to close the land sale in Boston within the fiscal year, so that introduces variability. And last but very importantly, we've talked about and are committed to a level of investment that's needed to continue to advance our margin of superiority and we're not going to let up on that.","So where does that put us overall? I think the most probable outcome is mid-single digits, consistent with what we've delivered fiscal year-to-date. We've said the fourth quarter will be a little bit better and we have that land sale gain in the fourth quarter, so maybe slightly above that. Everything goes right and that opens up numbers closer to the top end of the range. A couple of problems and we're probably closer to the bottom end of the range. That's how I view the guidance and why I think it's appropriate that we provided the guidance that we have.","You raised your next question, gets really to the sustainability not just to the top line, but at the bottom line both for this year and as we go forward. And remember, in a currency neutral environment, we're talking about core earnings per share number this year that are well into the double digit range -- high double digits on a high end of the range. So the fundamental earnings power that exists behind the top line growth that we've been delivering is significant and should remain significant. And then we'll just have to see what happens to things like currencies and commodities and tariffs.","In terms of sustainability of the top line, obviously we increased our guidance range or increased our guidance period to a strong 4%. We do that with confidence of sustainability of the numbers. One of the big questions we've all been wrestling with over the course of this fiscal year has been what happens to pricing and can manufacturer successfully price in this environment? I think we're gaining collectively increased confidence that that should be available to us, done the right way, coupled with innovation in a way that builds the value equation for consumers and customers and you're seeing that play through. You certainly saw that for example in Kimberly's results yesterday.","The biggest measure though that we're focused on internally in terms of the sustainability of that top line is superiority and being able to deliver to that day-in, day-out across all five sectors that matter. That is highly dependent on innovation, disruptive innovation that grows categories that inflects market growth rates and if we can continue to do that and frankly expand that successful effort across each of the categories, we should be in very good shape. If we can't in categories where performance drive brand choice will have more difficulty. But our recent success, the progress in the market, even market growth itself which is marginally up versus last time we talked, give us confidence that a higher level of sales growth is deliverable and sustainable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is actually Cody [ph] on for Jason this morning. Two questions. One, at your current rate, it looks like you will not hit the high end of your $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion savings per year which was your target. It seems to be one of the areas that has hold back your margin growth. What is causing the cost savings to come in below your target and how should we think about savings for 4Q '19?","Jon Moeller","It's largely timing, so we expect to get close to our original communication on those savings and for example, the Tabler Station plant in West Virginia is just coming online with more categories being produced there and the startup cost and integration cost now being exceeded hopefully by savings. We remain committed to a higher level of cost-to-good sold savings, we view it as deliverable over the next couple of years. We might be a little bit lower and some years a little bit higher. In other years, we don't expect any delta from that representation to be a major driver for margin and the fact in the fourth quarter we expect a positive comparison to year ago on both gross and operating margin.","Unidentified Analyst","Just thinking on gross and operating margin. Profitability rate has been a bit disappointing on such high organic sales growth. What's holding back your gross margin expansion in an environment where commodity inflation is easing, you are passing through the price and as I said, organic sales growth has been the strongest it has been in years? And SG&A as a percentage of sales grew much more than we anticipate at this quarter. What drove that?","Jon Moeller","A couple of question within that. First of all, gross margin was flat versus year ago, which is a sequential improvement as we had indicated and as I said, next quarter I expect positive gross margin comparison. Overall, the flow through from sales earnings is dramatically impacted as we've talked many times by $1.4 billion of after tax of FX, commodity and transportation hits, as well as the tariffs that have been imposed. And as I indicated, our currency neutrals, just take out one of those headwinds, core earnings per share numbers are well into the double digits and as I mentioned on the call, core operating profit on a constant currency basis will be up 7%.","So you just can't look past those big drivers of margin compression and remember, when we're pricing to recover those cost -- because you could say, 'Well, yes, I understand that those cost are in there, but aren't you pricing to recover them?' We're pricing to recover the cost, not to recover the margin. So we typically see margin compression. That's just a function of the math behind that until we get through the cycle of market declines that typically occur with significant pricing and then back to growth. But I'm very confident that margin expansion both gross and operating will be a part of our algorithm going forward. It has to be and we're delivered top third TSR, and we're committed to it.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thank you. I wanted to talk a little bit about the state of competition because it seems that competitive battles are increasing whether it's in toothpaste against total SF or diapers with Huggies launching something new this summer; laundry, Heinkel\u2019s obviously made a lot of noise we haven't seen in the marketplace. But through all of that, you've accelerated your sales growth, you're also spending more so or at least it seems you called it the hundred basis points of higher marketing spend. So can you talk about what you see going forward? Because obviously those competitive battle seem to be continuing to brew up. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Our industry is a competitive industry, across markets, across decades, and will continue to be. We have a very strong and capable competition and we've indicated that we expect a strong response to our share gains. If we do our job and continue to increase the superiority advantage and if that translates into increased or sustained market growth, we'll be just fine. If we're unable to do that, as I said earlier, we'll have some challenges. It would be very unusual in an industry that's as competitive as ours that we're going to be winning every day versus every competitor in every category, in every country. That has not been our historical experience, it's not our current experience, it won't be our future reality, but where we can win 2\/3 of those encounters, we're likely to drive to proportional top and bottom line growth.","The other thing that's three very positive developments in the market that are important to understand as we think about the role of competitiveness and competition, one is that again, market growth is inflecting slightly positive which is a very good thing. The second is that pricing is occurring where it needs to occur. That's a very good thing. Third, promotion levels. If you look at certainly U.S. results are down. I'm talking at a category level and they're down meaningfully. They're down 5% below a year ago in terms of percentage of volume that's being sold on promotion. And marketing spending is up. You see that pattern. In our results, you see it in other's results and that\u2019s a fairly - at a very aggregate level, a fairly constructive set of observations or dynamics. Each day is a new day, but as we sit here today, that all looks pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","I was wondering if you would be able to maybe break out growth in the quarter? Enterprise versus focus markets to the extent you're thinking about the business that way? And more generally, as you've been rolling out and communicating that new business structure over the last six months or so, I'm wondering to just to what extent it may be changing behavior, improving decision-making efficiency or maybe just the way you're planning fiscal '20, just some thoughts and context around how that change is taking shape. And if I could squeeze in, just a cleanup question; I think you had mentioned in SG&A this quarter 140 basis points of inflation and other impacts just including Merck. And I'm just curious as to how much of that is transitory, it's kind of unique to the quarter or is spending inflation and elective spending that will persist over the future? Thanks.","David Taylor","Thanks, Steve. The majority of the SG&A increased, not all of it, but the majority is due to the addition of Merck to our consolidated results, and importantly, the reflection of the integration costs. So we're going to go through one-time costs to get to synergies going forward. It will also annualize inclusion of Merck in our results after two more quarters. So I don't expect this to be an ongoing negative, I expect it to be ongoing positive once we get to the full integration and deliver the synergies that we expect to deliver. There is also just for clarity within that SG&A number, a reflection of the accrual that we make for compensation and with the results we're delivering, that number is higher this year than it would have been in prior years; so that's also in there. And Jon can help you kind of tease out the relative components here in terms of magnitude. I think excluding Merck, SG&A would have been up slightly reflecting increases in investment as we've talked about across the vectors of superiority. But again, as we go forward, I would expect operating margin as soon as next quarter to hopefully be a positive comparison versus year ago. And certainly, in our construct next year we'd be anticipating the same.","In terms of breaking out growth by enterprise markets and focus markets; I'm honestly not prepared to do that today, we're still going through the work of micro-organization design and rewiring the companies reporting back to them just to accommodate exactly the question that you've asked and we'll be prepared to answer that in the future. But the analog I can give you though it's not precise or completely clean; I mentioned that growth was broad-based -- in the quarter we just completed, we grew 3% in developed markets, 9% in developing markets. I expect both sets of markets focused in enterprise to be sources of growth going forward. For perspective again, if you just look at that developed market number, we grew 4% in the U.S. in the last quarter, we grew 3% in Europe, we grew mid-single digits in Japan; so those are going to be -- when you look at the absolute growth that those markets are delivering it's the majority of our growth. We want to maintain the growth upside that exists in some of the enterprise markets and we certainly want to maintain an optionality on future growth and profitability. So this isn't an either\/or dynamic, we are set up differently now in those two different sets of markets to win in each.","And we'll be prepared to talk more about how this is manifesting itself in terms of specific plans when we discuss our plans for next year. But generally, we're all pretty excited about the opportunities that this presents and are moving excitedly forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan.","Andrea Teixeira","So Jon, if you can a little bit elaborate more on Merck; so, you're saying like excluding Merck EBITs would have been slightly up. And I understand your commentary about the fact that once the synergies are coming through, you expect that to be less of a drag. But just on an apples-to-apples basis, I mean, the EBIT margin for that business is still probably going to cycle the next three quarters being a drag, if you can kind of give us like -- a little bit of a context there? And on the category growth -- I'm sorry, on the commodity cost pressures; I understand some of the $1.4 billion is backward-looking. So if you can give us like a state of the union or how on a sequential basis you're seeing the puts and takes for both, resins and transportation. Thank you.","David Taylor","When you look at the quarter, we just completed from a bottom-line standpoint, operating profit, operating margin and all the way through to EPS, I think -- again, the biggest driver is FX. And as I mentioned, you'd have core operating growth on a constant currency basis of 7%. So I think it's important as we talk about what exists going forward and what doesn't to make sure that we have that in our mind's eye as well. The Merck dynamic is largely one of transition costs and I'm not quite sure how those fall by quarter over the next couple of quarters but I would expect us to continue to incur costs to integrate and transition that business. So yes, for the next two quarters until it annualizes and then it will do more than annualized; it will not only annualize, it will improve as we deliver the synergies.","From -- and again, Jon can give you more detail there if you need that. From a commodity cost standpoint, we've seen slight easing and parts of the commodity exposure that we have, but not in all. I don't see the commodity environment in terms of our exposures in aggregate being dramatically different than it was when we talked last quarter; maybe a little bit better, but not necessarily a lot. And going forward, in terms of what we see, for example, in the pulp [ph] market, and we certainly don't have a crystal ball in this regard, but if we just look at the combination of demand and supply, there is no real reason to believe that that rolls over dramatically anytime soon. In terms of resins and the petro-complex [ph], your guess is as good as mine.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson ","Hi, good morning. Can you talk more about grooming, kind of from a high-level perspective because it just seems outside of the big promotion you had in the September quarter, that category has been a weight on your overall results for several years now. And I get it as you say, \"Hey, in a portfolio sometimes things are going to work, sometimes things aren't.\" I get that. But still the consistency of the weakness in the business, despite what we hear about innovation, despite the pricing reset, it just seems so stubborn. So, I guess number one, how committed are you to the category? I mean, you've made big decisions to get out of Duracell, to get out of fragrances. Is grooming something that you really even need to begin over the long run? And number two, it's still, I think your highest margin business at least on a pretax basis. So, is there room to do another major reinvestment, another big price cut or some other reset there to get growth going? Thanks. ","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Wendy. Let me just start with the Merck [ph] if you will. So, the grooming segment in the last quarter was down 1%. That's minus three in appliances and flat in the watch shave part of the business. So, not where we want to be in terms of growth, but not a disaster by any means. It also is a very different, the results are very different by geography with fairly strong results in Europe, fairly strong results in developing markets and continued market growth challenges primarily as well as some competitive challenges in the U.S. We are investing more right now behind the launch of SkinGuard, which as you know, addresses the 70% of men who feel that they have a sensitive skin and that the shaving experience provides irritation. To the extent that we can address that issue, which we feel SkinGuard does in a delightful way, we have the potential to increase usage, bring man back into the category who have left or increase the shave of frequency because it's no longer uncomfortable. And that's exactly what we're seeing right now in Europe. And I mentioned the system is part of that market and [indiscernible] fluoxetine to 10% market growth since we've introduced SkinGuard and growing slightly ahead of that. We have more work to do in the U.S. and probably do need to invest more to get sufficient awareness and trial, which we're fully prepared to do.","So, that's how we're thinking about that business overall. The female part of the business continues to do very, very nicely. We just introduced kind of an exciting exclusive brand with Walmart called Joy, which is off to a great start. This was a business that we not only want to keep it, but that we like and feel we can win in long-term. ","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Thanks, and morning, everybody. I wanted to re-ask a question around pricing and volume related impact. Maybe not specific to you but overall the level of pricing seems to be having some impact on volumes from, I guess, from an overall standpoint, more probably developed versus developing markets. Probably a few more, almost entirely that way. I guess I'm curious whether you're seeing things within your categories. And I wanted to re-ask also the question on competitive response and kind of think about it may be in a different way, have you seen anything that's changed on a category basis? We obviously see increasing threats but so far doesn't seem to be that the overall level of increase has gone higher. And then just lastly, kind of related to it. So if inputs have, I don't know, peek through or just at a high level but maybe not going much higher, how have the discussions gone from a retailer standpoint seeing that a lot of them are still eating these price increases and what would your expectations be kind of going forward, whether you can sustain or retain that level of pricing? Or do you have to do more from a promotional standpoint? So, you kind of said that the level of promotional activity is low, so does that increase kind of as we look out over the longer term? ","Jon Moeller","Yes. If we look at the overall equation on an aggregate basis as relates to pricing, we're relatively optimistic. I see the volume dynamic slightly different than you may see it. We have had significant volume declines and particularly developing markets as we've made major increases places like Argentina and places like Turkey, where market size has been negatively impacted. If I look quarter-to-quarter, so when we've talked last time to our conversation today, I feel more positive about the pricing environment than I did when we talked last. And in part that's because of some moves have been made by significant competitors and you'll see that reflected in their results. I don't know, but I think what you're going to see broadly, and I'm just reflecting on the level of market growth, which has inflected a little bit, it's pretty good top line performance from the HPC industry in this quarter and there will always be a small impact on volume as we adjust prices appropriately. But again, I feel fairly comfortable about where we stand currently. ","Our conversations with our retail partners are primarily based on joint value creation on market growth and our margin. The only way they make progress is through market growth. Our shared growth is not that meaningful for them. They want the market to grow and they want our items to generate an appropriate margin for them. And in that context, the pricing dynamic is actually a positive, not a negative. More importantly, we try to take pricing in very smart ways, specifically combining pricing with innovation. With the value equation we're offering consumer's increases. It doesn't decrease. And ideally, the value equation that we're offering our retail partners increases both in terms of the market growth potential and in terms of the margin and that's where we focus our conversations. ","Operator","Next, we'll go to Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi ","Good morning, everyone. Jon, I was hoping you can give an update on DS3. I know obviously it's a pretty small initiative at this point, but it does kind of align with the whole disruptive nature of how you're thinking about R&D. What are the early learning and are you going to put P&G brands on it and is it going to be own brand? Any kind of context you can give would be interesting.","Jon Moeller","We're very excited about the DS3 and its potential across a number of our categories from a consumer delight standpoint, from a product efficacy standpoint, from the degrees of innovation. It opens up to us in terms of how we can formulate that product and what we can include with it or put in it. But it is very early days and we are working in transactional environments with consumers today across several categories to understand how we can optimize the potential of this very exciting innovation. And that includes work to understand how it can best be positioned from a branding standpoint. So, all of that is work underway, Nik and we'll share more as we learn more and decide more. But this is just a wonderful opportunity that allow us a superior forum and multiple different categories, potentially the creation of some new jobs to do as well. So, we're very, very excited about it and thanks for asking about it. ","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. ","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning. A super quick question on Merck as a follow-up. Just, Jon, I just want to clarify that the integration costs were in fact part of the SG&A expenses quarter. Is that in fact the case?","Jon Moeller","That's, in fact, the case. Correct.","Steve Strycula","And then switching over to Baby Care and Gillette, I noticed in the release this morning, it appears that Baby Care trends to sell already quarter-on-quarter slightly and you called out competition. I just wanting to know whether this was primarily U.S. versus China and how you see both of those markets moving forward. And then lastly, to an earlier question, how do you think about the inflection point for Gillette as SkinGuard gains traction you're advertising? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","I'll focus on Baby since we haven't discussed that much during the call so far. Market share trends in Baby are actually improving and sequentially, past 12, past 6, past 3 months on a global basis. So, that's very encouraging. We did see a reduction in the rate of growth in China, but still growing share overall. And that's really the story on Baby with a lot of innovation to come. So, importantly, and I want to be a little bit careful here from a competitive sensitivity standpoint, but to ensure that our as much as possible, our entire portfolio offers a superior experience for consumers, again, across the pricing ladder and form offerings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So, to help answer the sustainability of top line question, would it be possible to desegregate the drivers of the 5% top line growth a little bit differently than you typically do? And I get the precise numbers might be hard, but sort of in terms of lift [ph] price change, lower trade spend or promo, same-store sales like all else equal same-store sales and then shelf space. Understanding those dynamics might be helpful for all of us to then be able to think about which one of those dynamics are sustainable going forward. And if you can in that talk a little bit about the Argentina price health that you and all your peers, it's not just you but all your peers are getting as well and how that figures into your numbers would be helpful. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Argentina pricing, I think had about a 20 to 30 basis point, in fact, on our overall aggregate top line. So, positive but not a huge driver. As you can appreciate, Ali, sitting here right now, I don't have the ability to break down the numbers in the way that you've been asking for, but let me make a couple of comments. One is if you look at our traditional breakdown, all components are driving top line growth, volume, pricing mix. That's a much more sustainable equation as I think you'll readily appreciate than when you have only one of those or only two of those driving the top line. So that itself speaks to sustainability of the model. And within that price was two points in the quarter. Volume was a positive impact. Price was a positive impact.","The second thing, you mentioned shelf space. And we spent some time this quarter intentionally talking about our go-to-market execution and it's importance in this turnaround, and in the sustainability of the top line going forward. And it's very important and we are seeing increased distribution, both in terms of accounts but also in terms of shelf space. We are seeing significant cooperation from our retail partners, again in the spirit of joint value creation and are seeing them viewing us as a source of that potentially more potently than has been the case in recent history. So we're very positive about the progress we're making with the retail trade, be that online or offline, and that speaks to the sustainability of results.","I will try to get you more perspective overtime along the lines you've asked, but as I said, you can appreciate I don't have that readily available here.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","I wanted to understand maybe bigger picture about how discretionary marketing investments work. It seems to me, both from the 100 basis points relative increase in marketing you called out -- all about the over performance on tax rate and coincident with that that there is a level of discretionary investment here and I can understand why that would be. What I'm trying to tell you is how practically that works, so they are like lists of spending people want-to-do and when the environment there so justifies, you or your people in your suite kind of are able to approve that or on a rolling basis; I'm trying to understand what the marginal -- how you think about marginal ROI when opportunities to invest you come up like this and clearly, the driving from top line right now should we expect that to continue to be the case going forward. Just that kind of discipline and process I'd love some insight on. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Majority of those decisions are made by individual category Presidents and Group Presidents who have the clearest view to the opportunities that exists and the return that can be generated on those opportunities. And typically, only if they find themselves in a bind as related to delivering their bottom-line objectives where they come to David and I and ask for an essence of view of the corporate degrees of flexibility that would facilitate investment; that's point one. Point two, where we find smart opportunities to invest, we are going to invest. And I try to make that clear even in articulating the maintenance of our guidance range on a bottom-line for the fiscal year. We really believe that in these categories where performance drives brand choice, we need to be superior across all five vectors of superiority and we're very determined to deliver that.","And that doesn't mean that we're going to do stupid things, we're very focused on return but we know that superiority delivers return in these categories, and in the categories where we've truly been able to bring that to market across the portfolio, the results have been really terrific; not just in terms of our own business but in terms of the inflection of market growth rates and the acceleration of market growth rates. So I'm not sure that gives you the granularity that you're looking for but again, the vast, vast majority of decisions where and how to invest are made by individual categories and individual markets, and they're held within that to deliver a bottom-line objective and an overall value creation objective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Jon, just going back to Baby; I mean how comfortable are you that Baby can turn in light of kind of unfavorable demographics for the foreseeable future? And I'm just trying to understand, you know, if the birth rate continues to decline, both at U.S. and around the world, I mean how do you grow that business and is that reasonable to expect it to grow in the next couple of years?","Jon Moeller","On a global basis, we expect population to increase; the number of babies born each year to increase. So, again on a global basis, as this is witnessed by current market growth rates, this should be a very attractive category. The other encouraging aspect Bill is that what is growing the fastest within the Baby Care category are the pants form -- particularly, premium pants and premium Type A diapers. So I don't want to make an absolute statement or an overgeneralization, but generally, the category is mixing up, not in every case but in an aggregate. China is a clear example of that, and generally, smaller families contribute to that dynamic. The preciousness of one child versus the family I grew up in of eight children generates a very different purchase dynamic.","So there is nothing that we see that causes us concern that this is a category that's going to be declining. There are certain markets that will present challenges and we need to make sure as I said earlier that we're superior across each points of the pricing ladder that people choose to enter the category in or move to. And if we do that, this should be a very, very attractive business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Just wanted to ask within Beauty; your top line looked strong and I would have expected stronger EBIT growth driving that. And then in contrast in Fabric Care, you had really, really strong profit growth; can you just talk to some of the drivers of -- what happened to margins in each of those respective businesses, Beauty and Fabric?","David Taylor","Once we get below the top and bottom lines on an individual category basis, I'm a little bit ill-equipped to give you the quality of answer that I think you deserve. So I'm going to ask you to follow-up with Jon on that. Clearly in Fabric Care, we've dialed back significantly on promotion levels which has had a big impact on profitability. In both categories we have productivity savings coming into effect, we're investing pretty heavily in the Beauty business to drive that top line and that's responding very nicely. I'm comfortable overall with the combination of top and bottom-line growth rates in both of those businesses but Jon can provide you a little bit more granularity.","Operator","Our next question comes on the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","So, first a quick housekeeping item; the gain on the sale of the Gillette site in Boston that you expect in the fourth quarter, that's about $0.04 to $0.05 a share, if my notes are correct, and I think that's going to be in the SG&A line, not another income?","Jon Moeller","It's, it's -- I would call the range $0.04 to $0.06, and yes, it will be in SG&A.","Joe Altobello","Okay. And then shifting gears to the after-tax headwinds from FX, commodities, currencies; still it looks about a $1.4 billion this year and I know this is a big assumption but if you assume nothing changes what would that number look like for fiscal '20 with commodities getting better at transport rates, at least on the stock market down dramatically year-over-year?","Jon Moeller","Yes, it's a hard question to answer believe it or not. I realize it would seem relatively simple but nothing is in the space. You know, if you just look at etcetera payables [ph], so nothing else changes. You've seen the constant currency earnings per share growth numbers I've provided, so you see the significant leverage as we hopefully continually sustainably grow the top line that should lead to improved margins and that constant currency number which is well into double digits still assumes the commodity hit on the tariff hit, so if all of that goes away, we're in a much better place.","Now the second question as you'll rightly move to is, what to -- that doesn't just affect P&G, it affects other competitors and what do they do with that savings? And do they spend that back? Do they take it to the bottom-line? How is it spent back? All of that will have an impact on what actually happens from a bottom-line standpoint in the scenario that you described. But clearly, it would be a more -- it's hard to imagine it wouldn't be a more positive scenario and we're hopeful that's the case. Having said that, as we went into last year and this is why you know, I'm kind of anchored to fairly wide ranges because I think it reflects reality, we went into last year and within months had an additional $400 million after-tax and currency impacts alone. And then we had the introduction of the tariffs as we went through the year. So, it's -- I would encourage you to think in ranges.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great, thank you very much. Two questions if I may. First, just wanted to go back to the operating leverage or lack of leverage in the results and wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about the FX impact and why given the significant way to the U.S. the impact is so much higher on earnings than it is on sales and if there is anything you could do with about that overtime? So that would be the first question.","And then second, just a little bit more detail on e-commerce; great overall results, up 20% globally. Could you give us a little bit more detail in terms of how the U.S. did? How China did? And whether you're gaining share or not on e-commerce? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","In terms of currency on margin, the impact; if you look at the gross margin as we said in our prepared remarks, it was flat all-in on a core basis versus year ago. Constant currency was plus 60 basis points, so you get an idea of the impact on a gross margin. On operating margin, we were 60 basis points down versus year ago, all-in core, and ex-currency we were 40 basis points up. So, again with that top line result as hopefully currency annualizes and doesn't -- in this scenario where it doesn't continue to devalue there should be significant leverage within the income statement that hasn't existed this year as we've tried to work our way through that.","E-commerce; we're doing well on a geographic basis pretty broadly. There are a lot of dynamics within individual retail accounts which drives a fairly high degree of volatility within the result, but if you trend it out beyond -- you know, one quarter, we continue to make really significant progress. We still have a share opportunity, we're growing share in China but our shares at e-commerce are still lower than offline; so that continues to present an opportunity that we're closing that gap quarter-on-quarter. In the U.S. our shares are more representative on the online business of our offline position.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Have a great day.","Jon Moeller","Well, thanks everybody. Again, I think a very strong quarter. I do believe these kind of results or a proximity of them should be sustainable going forward, and we should be able to drive more leverage to the income statement and a more benign effects on environment but very, very positive developments sequentially; so thanks. Thanks for participating."],"17452":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) F1Q 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 25, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - CFO","John Chevalier - IR","Analysts","Bill Schmitz \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities","John Faucher \u2013 JPMorgan","Dara Mohsenian \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Connie Maneaty \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Michael Stieb \u2013 Credit Suisse","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Operator","Welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter-end conference call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.","Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and adjusted for after tax impact of major divestitures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings.","Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, and good morning. Before we get to results, I want to start with a few housekeeping items. Consistent with our emphasis on productivity, as well as our focus on annual versus quarterly planning periods, A.G. Lafley and I have decided to apportion our efforts on P&G investor communications as follows.","A.G. will lead our fiscal year end call, providing perspective on the year we\u2019ve just completed and outlining our priorities for the new fiscal year. A.G. will represent P&G at our most significant each year. This year those will be the Barclays Back to School conference and CAGNY. And he will lead the annual shareholders meeting each October.","I\u2019ll head up the non year-end quarterly calls and the remaining investor conferences. We will both continue to meet on a one-on-one basis with current and potential investors. We\u2019ll continue to involve other key executives in investor meetings and conferences, as we have in the past.","Our objective is to provide shareholders the information they want and need in a more productive manner that is consistent with our business planning approach. One last announcement, John Chevalier, who heads up our investor relations practice, will now report directly to me. John was previously reporting to our treasurer, Teri List, who is now at Kraft Foods. John joins me on the call this morning.","Let me move now to our first quarter results. All-in sales grew 2%, including the 2-point headwind from foreign exchange. Organic sales grew 4%, putting us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Organic sales growth was driven by strong organic volume growth of 4%. Pricing and mix were both neutral to sales growth for the period.","Organic sales were in line or ahead of a year ago in all reporting segments. Organic sales were up low single digits in developed markets and high single-digits in developing markets. P&G global value market share was around 20% for the most recent 3-month period. We held or grew global market share in businesses representing about two-thirds of global sales.","Moving to the bottom line, all-in earnings per share were $1.04. This includes $0.02 of noncore restructuring costs. Core earnings per share were $1.05, down $0.01 versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $0.09 per share headwind. On a currency neutral basis, core earnings per share was up 8% for the quarter.","Core operating profit margin declined 70 basis points as solid organic sales growth and 200 basis points of cost savings were offset by foreign exchange and gross margin mix impacts.","Core gross margin was down 130 basis points. Strong cost savings of 160 basis points and volume leverage was more than offset by geographic and category mix of 140 basis points, foreign exchange of 80 basis points, higher commodity costs, and higher manufacturing startup costs versus the prior year.","Core SG&A costs decreased 60 basis points, driven by overhead cost savings of 40 basis points, marketing spending efficiencies, and volume leverage. These benefits were partially offset by foreign exchange, general wage inflation, and reinvestments in innovation and go-to-market capability.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8%. The combined impact from tax, interest expense, interest income, non-operating income, and outstanding share count was essentially neutral to core earnings per share growth.","We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $2.5 billion in stock, and returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders as dividends. Free cash flow was reduced by a discretionary cash contribution of nearly $1 billion to our German defined benefit pension fund. This is reflected in the change in other operating assets and liabilities line on the cash flow statement.","Free cash flow productivity was 43% for the quarter, including a negative 32 point impact from the pension contribution. This contribution was included in our projection of about 90% free cash flow productivity for the fiscal year.","Overall, we remain on track with each of our fiscal year objectives. We\u2019re focused on four important areas to drive continued improvement in our results. Value creation for consumers and share owners is our top priority.","Operating TSR is our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level requiring sales growth, progress on growth and operating margin, and strong cash flow productivity.","Operating TSR drives focus on core businesses, our leading, most profitable categories, and leading, most profitable markets. Our strongest business unit and total company positions are in the U.S. We need to continue to ensure that our home market stays strong and is growing.","We\u2019ll continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets, with a focus on the categories and countries with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. Developing markets will continue to be a significant growth driver for our company.","We\u2019ll continue to focus the company\u2019s portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create the most value. We will continue to exit businesses where we determine that potential buyers with different capability sets can create more value than ourselves.","Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we\u2019re continuing to push forward with our productivity and cost savings efforts. We made good progress over the last fiscal year and a half, we have strong plans for fiscal 2014, and are working to accelerate fiscal 2015 plans into 2014.","Versus the target run rate of $1.2 billion, we\u2019re planning more than $1.4 billion of cost of goods savings this fiscal year across materials, logistics, and manufacturing expense. We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We\u2019re up more than 8% fiscal year to date.","We\u2019re continuing the work on North American and European supply chain redesign to lower cost, reduce inventory, and improve customer service. This work will require additional investment in both restructuring and capital, but should generate very attractive returns. We\u2019ll communicate more details as plans are finalized.","We will deliver our 2014 enrollment reduction goals and then work to accelerate [role] reduction\u2019s plan for 2015 into 2014. There are several teams supported by external advisors and benchmarks working in parallel on plans to deliver these reductions. The teams span business sectors, market development organizations, and corporate functions. We\u2019ll be working to consolidate individual team plans into one overall company plan by the end of the calendar year and plan to discuss key elements with you at the CAGNY conference in February.","We continue to drive marketing ROI improvements through an optimized mix of advertising media, greater clarity of messaging, and greater efficiency in non-advertising marketing spending. We expect absolute marketing spending to increase this year, but marketing as a percentage of sales to decline modestly versus the prior year level. We are committed to making productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage.","We\u2019ll continue to strengthen our innovation efforts. We aim to be the innovation leader in every product category where our brands compete. Near term, we\u2019re shipping major innovation upgrades across the entire baby care line in North America, providing superior dryness, comfort, and fit, particularly overnight, to better deliver what moms want for their babies.","The Ariel pods launch in Western Europe is tracking well above expectations. Consumption trends on Tide pods have accelerated even further in the U.S. behind new trial-building merchandising.","We\u2019re continuing to see strong growth in our new oral care expansion markets, and are experiencing significant growth behind the expansion of our 3D White innovation.","We\u2019re delivering strong market share gains in the U.S. deodorant category, behind the Secret Stress Sweat innovation and on Old Spice, as we launch new scent collections and commercial campaigns.","We\u2019re also strengthening our share position of the U.S. battery business, behind the Quantum innovation and recent distribution increases. P&G battery value share is up nearly 1.5 points for the past three months.","In family care, our recent Bounty upgrades were recognized in external product testing. Bounty had the top three products in the test, including a landslide victory for Bounty Duratowel over all other products.","Recent product packaging and commercial innovations on Pantene are driving strong growth in the Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa region. Pantene shipments were up double digits in both regions for the quarter.","Next, we\u2019re improving execution and operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently, and more reliably. It\u2019s not about exhorting the organization to do better, it is about rigorously following tried and true work processes that deliver results. It\u2019s only airing high ROI advertising. It\u2019s disciplined initiative launch qualification and planning. It\u2019s about staying ahead of changing regulatory standards to ensure we\u2019ve maintained a full supply capability. It\u2019s about everyone playing their position and playing it well.","Our progress in operating discipline and execution is beginning to be recognized. In the most recent Advantage Monitor U.S. customer survey, which rates retailer satisfaction with their suppliers, P&G improved its overall ranking for the middle third of the 40 suppliers evaluated to the top third, with significant improvements in areas such as category development and shopper insights. Our goal is to be number one, and our focus is on translating this improved operating performance into better and more consistent top and bottom line results.","Last, we\u2019re making strategic investments in innovation and go-to-market capabilities. The budget increase in R&D will enable us to strengthen our near and mid-term innovation pipeline. Our go-to-market investments are primarily focused on improving sales coverage in our fastest-growing markets and fastest-growing channels.","We believe that the focus we\u2019re bringing to these four areas: operating TSR, productivity, innovation, and operational excellence will enable us to continue to improve results, which brings us to guidance.","We\u2019re reconfirming 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line, and cash. We\u2019re maintaining our organic sales growth range of 3% to 4%. Achieving organic sales growth in the upper half of our target range would result in modest overall market share growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of about 2 points, which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the fiscal year.","On the bottom line, we\u2019re maintaining our forecast for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%. This translates to constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 11% to 13%.","On an all-in GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to grow approximately 7% to 9%. This range reflects somewhat lower noncore restructuring costs in fiscal year 2014 versus the prior year.","First half core earnings per share growth will likely be flat to slightly down versus prior year. Second half growth will be much stronger. Our second half forecast is not based on a significant deceleration in organic sales growth.","Second half earnings growth increase is driven by foreign exchange and cost structure. Foreign exchange will be a significant headwind in the first half, but will moderate in the second half at recent spot rates. We estimate that about 70% of the fiscal year FX impact will be in the first half of the fiscal year.","We\u2019ll also annualize operating impacts from last year\u2019s Venezuelan bolivar devaluation in the second half. There are several second half cost benefits. Manufacturing startup costs will largely annualize in the second half of fiscal 2014 and productivity savings will build throughout the year.","As you prepare your sales and earnings estimates for Q2, there are a few items you should keep in mind. Recall that the second quarter base period includes a $0.07 per share one-time gain from the sale of the Western European bleach business. We expect the foreign exchange headwind for Q2 to be similar to the impact we saw in the first quarter.","We\u2019re expecting a heightened level of competitive promotional spending, ahead of our product initiative\u2019s launch in early next calendar year, especially in North American fabric care and beauty.","We expect to deliver another strong year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, continuing to deliver on our commitment of cash return to shareholders.","In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we continue to be very transparent about some key items that are not included. Foreign exchange continues to be very volatile. Rates improved somewhat in September and October, largely reversing the large negative move we saw in late July and August. But this could quickly change.","The guidance we are reconfirming today is based on mid-October spot rates. We\u2019re closely watching the unrest in Egypt, which is a large business for us, and a base of export for the balance of Africa. Venezuelan price controls, access to dollars for imported products, and devaluation present risks, as do import restrictions and price controls in Argentina. Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth rates.","We continue to operate in a volatile environment, with uncertainty in the foreign exchange, decelerating market growth rates, and a rapidly developing policy environment. Against this backdrop, we have good market share momentum, a number of strong innovations coming to market over the balance of the year, and savings from productivity improvements that will continue to build.","Our first quarter results were in line with what we expected, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year and enabling us to make progress toward our long term growth objectives. We\u2019re making targeted investments in our core business in the most promising developing markets and biggest innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving the productivity and cost savings.","Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our share owners. That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in the slides, which we\u2019ve posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call.","I\u2019d be happy now to take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. You may begin.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank ","Two quick ones. China, it seems like business is doing pretty well market share-wise, everywhere in the world except for China. But if you look across categories, at least in the Nielsen data we have, you know, laundry, diapers, toothpaste, it seems like shares are under quite a bit of pressure recently. So wondering kind of what\u2019s going on there and sort of what the plan is to kind of fix that.","And the second thing is, and maybe I\u2019m making a huge deal about this, but this [influx] technology on the package side, could that be a game-changer going forward in terms of how you make and buy bottles and give you a pretty neat competitive cost structure advantage?","Jon Moeller ","First of all, China, volume market share was essentially flat in the quarter. We did lose a little bit of ground on value share, though that continued to build sequentially, has continued to build over the past 12, 6, 3 months. So we\u2019re reasonably comfortable about our position there. We\u2019ve got a very strong innovation program coming in the back half of the year and expect China to continue to be a significant source of growth for us.","On [influx], this is something we actually talked about at CAGNY. It\u2019s a disruptive proprietary breakthrough in the packaging area, and when rolled out across our businesses, it should deliver about $150 million in cost savings per year and will allow us to avoid about $50 million in capital expenditures annually. It will also bring significant sustainability benefits. It could reduce resin usage by over 100 million pounds per year and eliminate energy usage by over 250 million kilowatt hours.","And finally, we\u2019re hopeful that this breakthrough will allow us to reduce our time to market for package development by up to 50%. So it is something that we\u2019re excited about and should benefit from.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan ","Wanted to talk a little bit about the negative FX leverage you\u2019re seeing here in terms of from the top line to the bottom line, particularly how your manufacturing footprint is impacting that, whether that\u2019s a big transactional hit as you\u2019re importing products into countries like Brazil.","And then to sort tie that in, I\u2019ll try to make this two questions, it\u2019s actually one question, can you talk a little bit about the plan for local manufacturing? You\u2019ve got a lot of startup costs there. When can that go to being a real benefit as you look at not just your manufacturing cost, but also the ability to be more flexible when you\u2019re manufacturing locally?","Jon Moeller ","You\u2019re absolutely right on the dynamic on foreign exchange and the divergence between the top and bottom line impact. That disparity is primarily driven by very large currency moves in countries that have a significant dollar and euro denominated cost structure for imported materials and finished product.","Just for perspective, Japan and Venezuela, which both fall into that category, account for more than 40% of the FX-related profit hurt on the quarter. And you\u2019re also right that as we\u2019re able to localize more of the manufacturing, not only will we save a significant amount of money, but we\u2019ll in essence be operationally hedged more on the bottom line.","Timeline, we\u2019re bringing on a number of new facilities currently, as reflected in the startup cost figures that we\u2019ve been discussing for the past couple of quarters. I would look at that to yield benefits more in our next fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","First, just a detail question. Can you tell us how much U.S. organic sales growth was in the quarter in emerging markets? And then the real question is, I just was hoping you could characterize the pricing environment you\u2019re seeing right now, both in the U.S. and around the world. Clearly you\u2019ve made significant market share progress, but you did highlight you expected heightened competitive activity going forward. So should we expect pricing to deteriorate a bit going forward in the balance of the year? And do you view heightened competitive activity as a big threat, at this point, to your markets progress?","Jon Moeller ","First, on U.S. growth rate, organic sales was about 2%, and that\u2019s also consistent with the total developed markets growth rate, which was low singles. Developed markets grew about 8%.","On pricing, let me say a couple of things. First, relative to history, including the last quarter, if you look at price, inclusive of promotion, it was neutral to organic sales growth on the quarter. If you look further back, price, inclusive of promotion, has been neutral to positive for 11 consecutive quarters. It\u2019s been neutral to positive for 9 consecutive years.","We would much rather invest a dollar in innovation or equity, because those benefits are proprietary and sustainable. Promotion, price discounting, there\u2019s nothing proprietary about it, and it\u2019s typically not sustainable. If you look at our promotion, the percentage of sales that moved on promotion in the July-September quarter, it was down versus a year ago, not up. So that\u2019s the past.","As we look forward, it\u2019s important that while we\u2019d rather spend money on innovation and equity, it\u2019s important we be competitive from a promotion standpoint. We are not going to be ones who lead promotion escalation, but we will be competitive.","We do have a period coming up in the next quarter here that precedes pretty significant initiative launches for us, and it\u2019s not atypical in that environment that we see a little bit of an increase in promotion from the competitive set trying to load consumers ahead of our initiatives.","So we do expect that environment to tighten over the next three months as we head into our big initiative launch. Again, that\u2019s not something that we\u2019ll be leading. We\u2019ll continue to focus on innovation and equity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson \u2013 Citigroup","On the gross margin, I know you don\u2019t want to give too much specifics in terms of the full year outlook, but I assume some of the manufacturing startup costs are going to fall away. Hopefully, anyway. Can you comment kind of over the full course of this year whether you expect gross margin to be up or down?","Jon Moeller ","It certainly will sequentially improve, and should be positive certainly by the fourth quarter, early fourth quarter. We\u2019ll have to see where it nets out total year. I honestly don\u2019t think that much about that. But we do expect for gross margin progress to turn positive by the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman \u2013 Barclays","I wanted to ask a bit about beauty margins. They were up so significantly in the quarter I was curious what was driving that. The change in allocation of resources, or holding back as you sort of sort out plans for skincare? So questions on that.","And then coupled with that was in your prepared remarks, Jon, when you mentioned the heightened promotional environment expected in the second quarter ahead of initiative launches, you actually mentioned not just fabric care but also I think you said beauty, and that was sort of news to me if there\u2019s something significant coming in beauty, so if you could talk about that, it would be great.","Jon Moeller ","A large part of the quarter to quarter variability in profitability in beauty is being driven by initiative timing, and we have, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and as you referenced, we have a strong slate of initiatives coming to market December through March in beauty. The specifics are not items that we\u2019ve disclosed yet, and we\u2019ll do that as we get closer to the events themselves, but there is significant innovation coming.","The other thing that\u2019s impacting quarterly variability, which is a great thing, is real progress on productivity within the beauty business. They\u2019re working that as hard as anybody, and are frankly doing a great job.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","I just wanted to ask about Tide Simply. So I guess relative to Charmin and Bounty basic, it looks like the price gap there between the premium and the mid-tier segment in those respective categories is not as wide as in direct to laundry. Premium Tide versus the baseline is a very, very large gap. So the gap between Tide Simply and premium Tide is likely to be wider than what it is between Bounty and Charmin basics, and those mainline products.","So I guess the question is can you use those two as a benchmark? And how do you manage that? And is the thought process even correct there?","Jon Moeller ","It ultimately comes down to strong consumer segmentation and benefit alignment against those segments and the benefits that they\u2019re seeking. And it\u2019s more about that than it is about relative price point.","And as you can imagine, we\u2019ve been working this for some period of time, as you know, and we\u2019ve been working very hard to ensure that the offering is very attractive to the consumer segment that we\u2019re targeting and is less attractive to the current Tide consumer, which we believe we have achieved.","And that is more the mark of success on things like Bounty Basic, Charmin Basic, Luvs versus Pampers, that consumer segment and benefit alignment with their needs that drives success.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Two things. I first wanted to follow up on the language in the press release and your prepared remarks about the $0.07 I guess now one-time gain you asked us to include in your core last year, although it felt like it was smaller than $0.07 last year. I\u2019m just a little confused. Are you now asking us to restate that and take out the $0.07? Or what do you want us to do with that?","And then the other question I had is about the 200 basis points that you\u2019re saving this quarter. Obviously that\u2019s good. Is that enough relative to the way your competitors are doing? It certainly sounds like you\u2019re going to be ramping up that savings number. How much higher do you think it ramps to and for how long?","Jon Moeller ","First, relative to the $0.07 gain, what we\u2019re asking you to do is just simply be aware of it. We\u2019re just providing that as an awareness point. What you do with that is obviously your call. But we like people to not be surprised, and that\u2019s simply why we\u2019re calling it out. It will be in our core numbers in the base, and will be reported as part of our core comparison. So we\u2019re not restating anything here.","On savings, look, there\u2019s no amount of savings that\u2019s enough. Now, there is an amount of savings that\u2019s too much, when it starts cutting into capabilities for growth and those kinds of things. But we\u2019re going for everything we think is feasible and then asking ourselves is there more after that?","And I\u2019m not going to speculate on the ultimate amount of savings, but I think as you\u2019ve seen both last year and this year, generally we\u2019re exceeding, as opposed to underdelivering, our savings targets.","Last year we had $1.2 billion in cost of goods savings. That\u2019s about what we need to deliver the $10 billion objective this year. So far we\u2019re at about $1.4 billion. Last year we significantly overdelivered the SG&A enrollment, and this year we\u2019re committed to deliver our 2014 target and work to accelerate 2015 into 2014.","And we really want to make this, as many of us have described before, an ongoing part of our business model, our culture, our ethos. And I think there\u2019s a lot of possibility, to the extent that we\u2019re able to accomplish that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets ","I remember when A.G. first came back he was talking about the cost structure in some parts of the developed world still being too high. I\u2019m wondering where you stand on what sounded like it would be another more traditional type of bricks and mortar restructuring program that would run concurrently with the productivity initiative underway.","Jon Moeller ","That\u2019s what I was referring to in my prepared remarks relative to supply chain redesign in both North America and Western Europe, which is underway. It\u2019s in process, and we\u2019ll talk about it more as we kind of finalize our plans.","But that is a significant opportunity to both reduce cost, improve cash through reduced inventory, and importantly, improve customer service, and we\u2019re pretty excited about that that opportunity. Basically, our supply chains in both of those markets have come about over years, and through a number of acquisitions.","And this is an opportunity to step back and say, you know, if we were doing this over, how would we do this? What are the right levels of aggregation in terms of number of categories that are produced at a site? What are the right locations? How do you think about distribution opportunities serving existing customers and new customers? And so pretty excited about that opportunity, and we will bring more information to you as we finalize those plans.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","I wanted to come back to beauty. You talked a little bit about the innovation slate coming up and some of the margin expansion. I wanted to drill down on the organic sales growth. You were showing signs of acceleration to year-end. We see deceleration despite the easy comp, and it also stands in contrast to what looks to be, in terms of U.S. consumption offtake, accelerating trends. Can you help us understand what drove that deceleration, whether there\u2019s anything transitory behind it, and maybe what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t within that segment?","Jon Moeller ","First of all, this is a very competitive category. It\u2019s a category where I will readily admit we continue to have more work to do. So we\u2019re not yet where we want to be on this business. There are pieces of it that are working very well. Our personal cleansing business was up high single-digits on the quarter, our cosmetics business is doing extremely well, our deodorants business is doing extremely well.","I mentioned Pantene. In several parts of the world it\u2019s doing well. We continue to need to make progress on North American Pantene, on Olay, and we need to make progress in our salon professional businesses. So those are kind of the strengths and the weaknesses, as it were, and we\u2019re fully focused on maximizing the opportunity behind the strengths and addressing the opportunities.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Olivia Tong \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Want to talk a little bit about the share improvement. Obviously it continues. Where do you think that can top out at?","Jon Moeller ","Well, as I said several times on this call, we are in a very competitive market. Our expectation is that when we get everything working, we should be able to build a little bit of share each year. We\u2019re never going to be in a position where 100% of our business is building share at any given point in time. That\u2019s just not a realistic scenario in a very competitive industry that we compete in.","We\u2019ve talked about targeting kind of two-thirds to 70% of the business growing share, holding or growing share, at any point in time, and that\u2019s the level that leads to modest share growth on an annual basis. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Question on the gross profit, or gross margin side. To what extent does a lot of what is happening have to do with the category mix in which basically the fabric and baby care are the two [unintelligible] that are leading the growth? And in that context, knowing that beauty and grooming are challenged, can you help us understand healthcare, why the deceleration beyond the recall of the pet food product?","Jon Moeller ","You\u2019re absolutely right, in terms of the drivers of part of the gross margin pressure. There\u2019s about 140 basis points of mix impact within that gross margin comparison. Approaching half of that is the product mix, exactly what you referenced, which is faster growth in lower gross margin businesses like fabric care and our paper businesses and slower growth in some of our higher gross margin businesses.","In terms of healthcare, the real impact on the quarter was the recall on pet. The good news there is we\u2019re back up manufacturing full speed a perfectly great product. And so that should be in the past.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer ","Just in terms of the portfolio, I think one of the things that A.G. has tried to hammer home the last three or four months has been that Procter needs to be more focused, and I think the word he\u2019s used a number of times is \u201cchoiceful.\u201d","And so on that point, can you give us an example or examples of businesses where you believe you\u2019re underinvesting right now, and where you\u2019re overinvesting? And also, could you see yourself doing something like Unilever has done in the past, or like Kimberly-Clark has done more recently, where you actually pull out of certain geographies or categories in whole?","And then also in terms of a housekeeping item, you mentioned that you held or gained share in two-thirds of your businesses. I think that was a global number. What was that number in the U.S.?","Jon Moeller ","The two word choices that you provided are accurate, focused and choiceful. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re all working to do here. Obviously you can appreciate from a competitive standpoint why I wouldn\u2019t want to lay over many cards right here in terms of where we\u2019ll accelerate investment or decelerate investment.","But it is very much, as I said in our prepared remarks, a focus of ours, which is flowing investment to the areas, both businesses and geographies, where we believe we can create disproportionate value, and looking real hard at businesses where we\u2019re struggling to create value and looking to see if somebody else could potentially create more value than us.","We have pulled out of regions in the past. We used to be in Asia, in the tissue\/towel business. We used to be in Western Europe in the tissue\/towel business. And we\u2019re now largely a North American tissue\/towel business. And that was all driven by our assessment of our ability to create value in that industry, which we viewed as low potential.","So these are things, both categories and geographies, that we\u2019ll continue to look at. And as we always have done, whether it\u2019s pharmaceuticals or Folgers or snacks, or the Western European tissue\/towel business, where we determine that we can create more value on any business in a divestment context, there are two pieces of that. One is what our prognosis is going forward, the other is obviously we\u2019re not going to exit businesses in a value dilutive manner, so we need to have somebody who\u2019s willing to monetize some of that value they can create for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Jon, you had talked I guess this morning on CNBC about Europe and kind of moving sideways. And I was just wondering if maybe you can give us a little more color there, because as you alluded to, a lot of other companies are seeing pockets of growth in certain areas, and didn\u2019t know if it really is just straight sideways, or if there\u2019s any sign of hope, or kind of just any color you have would be great.","Jon Moeller ","There are definitely areas that are stronger within Europe. I\u2019m not telling you anything you don\u2019t know. Northern Europe is certainly stronger than Southern Europe. Southern Europe continues to be a real struggle. And there are markets that are pockets of hope, if you will.","But I want to step back on the whole Western European thing for a second. Changes in Western Europe in the consumer products category space have never been dramatic, and they continue to not be overly dramatic. You know, growth tends to oscillate between minus 1 and plus 1, and it\u2019s a good year when it\u2019s plus 1 and a bad year when it\u2019s minus 1. And we\u2019re not seeing significant departures from that aggregate picture.","And so it continues to be an environment where we think we can build sales. We believe we can build profit and create value. It\u2019s an area that we\u2019re focused on. But we just don\u2019t see a rebound to date.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jon Andersen from William Blair.","Jon Andersen - William Blair ","I\u2019m interested in asking about new channels, specifically the online channel. How important is the online channel to you today? What role does it play going forward? And are there distinct advantages to Procter from selling online? And I\u2019m thinking of things like increased consumption, reaching more consumers, or perhaps it\u2019s more profitable to sell through that channel.","Jon Moeller ","Well, we want our products to be available wherever, whenever, and however consumers want to shop. And there is certainly a segment of consumers in some categories that want to shop online, and we\u2019ll work to be available for them. The amount of our business that\u2019s currently in that channel varies by category. Still, as you would expect, the vast majority of our products are sold in traditional channels.","And I think the channel offers several advantages, and several disadvantages, just as our other channels do. It\u2019s a very effective way to target consumers, both from a marketing standpoint and then conversion to purchase. So we\u2019ll continue to look at it from that standpoint. But we really want to be present and viewed as best in class in each of the retail channels.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus ","Do you think the competitive environment is getting better or worse relative to your expectations? And I say this in the context of some of what I thought relatively provocative comments by your large competitor yesterday that it plans to rebase cost to fund investments. And sort of related to that, how do you think about the spending between promotional allowances and real advertising spend? I know you had mentioned that as a percentage of sales it would be up but less so absolutely as a percent?","Jon Moeller ","That\u2019s true of our aggregate marketing expense. Promotion expense in the July-September quarter, in terms of the percentage of our sales that moved on promotion, was actually down 7% versus a year ago. If you look at the total industry, it was about flat versus a year ago. So there are certain categories, certain items, certain competitors, where there may be an escalation in promotion, but it\u2019s not a broad characteristic of the environment, at least as we\u2019ve seen it to date.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research ","A housekeeping question and then something else. Can you update us as to your category growth rates in emerging regions and the U.S.? And then could you break out the 2% organic sales growth that you had in the U.S. in terms of volume mix and price? And then my other question is the 140 basis point negative hit to gross margins from mix, are you expecting that to lessen as you go through the year? And maybe [by half]? Is that a significant part of the gross margin improvement you\u2019re expecting?","Jon Moeller ","In terms of market growth rates, broad strokes we see 1% growth in developed markets, about 7% in developing markets, and aggregate, developing markets ranged from kind of mid-single digits to low double-digits, depending on the region. And the developed markets range anywhere from 2% market value growth in North America to about a 1% decline, consistent with what I was saying earlier, in Western Europe.","Relative to the 140 basis points mix impact and how that evolves going forward, as I mentioned in my response to Javier, about half of that is geographic and about half is product. And I would hope that over time, as we get our beauty business growing at market growth rates, the product portion of that would largely dissipate.","I do expect we\u2019ll continue to have disproportionate growth in developing markets, and we\u2019re not yet to the point in terms of economic development where those margins will be equal to the balance of the rest of the world. So we will continue to see some drag on mix from a geographic standpoint.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Stieb from Credit Suisse.","Michael Stieb \u2013 Credit Suisse","I was wondering if you could give us some more detail on the volume decline in the grooming segment. Is that largely due to category weakness? Or is it from some share losses?","Jon Moeller ","The category in the last three months was about flat. I think it was a 99 index. We did lose a little bit of share in the latest quarter. That was primarily driven by disproportionate growth in the disposables section of the business, where we are less well-developed. The encouraging piece of it is that Fusion continued to grow share, and that\u2019s a good thing long term. And if you look over longer periods of time, last year for example we built share in blades and razors, and I would expect that would be more characteristic of the situation going forward.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Jon, if you could just go back to the North America share question, I don\u2019t think we got an answer. Just if you could give directionally where things were strongest and weakest. And specifically in cleaning materials, so Tide Pods, if you could just break out what happened on the pod side versus the liquid laundry side.","Jon Moeller ","Thanks for giving me a chance to recover there. Multipart questions, my feeble memory sometimes gets the best of me. In North America we\u2019re holding or growing share in businesses representing between two-thirds to 70% of sales. So that continues to hold up very nicely. I actually don\u2019t have segment level in terms of pods versus liquids versus powder shares in front of me here, but please feel free to call John or Katie or Brian during the balance of the day and they can get you that information.","Operator","We have no other questions at this time.","Jon Moeller ","Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re reasonably happy with our first quarter results. In terms of its relation to our expectation, we know we still have more work to do. We\u2019re determined to do that, and we look forward to connecting with each of you soon. Thanks a lot."],"17490":["Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call January 27, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - CFO","Analysts","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo","John Faucher - JPMorgan","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Bill Schmidt - Deutsche Bank","Steve Powers - UBS","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Michael Steib - Credit Suisse","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets","Joe Altobello - Raymond James","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C.

If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable.","Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments for the pet care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes.","P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","October and December was another challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with significant foreign exchange headwinds, modest market growth and continued political and economic volatility. Against this backdrop, we were able to deliver organic top line growth and currency neutral core earnings growth that were in-line with our going in expectations. Organic sales grew 2% in 4 or 5 business segments, Baby, Feminine and Family Care, Grooming, Healthcare and Fabric and Home Care reported growth versus the prior year.","Top line growth trends improved as we move sequentially through the quarter finishing with mid-single digit organic sales growth in December. Organic volume was in-line with the prior year. Organic volume was up one point in developed markets; developing market volume was down slightly as we took pricing to offset foreign exchange devaluation across several countries. Pricing and mix each added a point to sales growth.","Overall, we held or grew worldwide share on businesses representing about half of company sales and about 60% of sales in the home U.S. market. We continue to grow share in Latin America and held share in Europe and India, Middle East and Africa. We lost some share in Asia, principally in China and Japan.","As we reported at the analyst meeting in November, we're growing share on more of our category leading brands in countries where it matters most, Pampers, Tide, Gillette and Pantene in the United States for example. We have opportunities on other important businesses like Family Care in the U.S. and in countries like China. On a constant currency basis, core [inaudible] share were up 6%, in-line with our expectations keeping us on track for double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year.","Virtually every currency in the world devalued versus the dollar with the Russian ruble leading the way. While we continue to make steady progress on strategic business and company brand and product initiatives and continue to increase and accelerate productivity savings, the progress has not been sufficient enough to offset FX. All-in sales were down 4% versus the prior year including a 5 point headwind from foreign exchange and a 1 point reduction from minor brand divestitures. Including FX which was a 14 percentage-point drag on the quarter, core earnings per share were $1.06 down 8% versus the prior year.","Given the magnitude of the impact, I thought it might be helpful to briefly recount how FX impacts reported results. I'll use the example of the ruble which depreciated 53% versus the dollar during the quarter and was down 78% for the first half of the fiscal year. The declining ruble impacts reported earnings in three ways for a total fiscal year hurt of about $550 million after-tax.","Here are the building blocks and how they break down. First, transaction impacts increased the cost of non-ruble denominated inputs. We import as an example Gillette blades and razors into Russia from Germany. Widening of the cross-rate between the euro and the ruble increases the Russian units cost of razors and reduces profit. Similarly, the local cost of plastic bottles which are denominated in euros and imported into Russia for the production of Fabric Care and Hair Care products have increased significantly. This transaction cost impact affects all manufacturers, multi-national and local, whose materials or finished products are imported from similar sources and are similarly denominated.","We attempt to recover these cost increases through pricing when local legal requirements and market realities allow it though there is a lag between the time the currency devalues, the costs are incurred and the pricing is taken and executed through our channels of distribution.","Second, we need to revalue transaction related foreign currency working capital balances. This includes the revaluation of working capital balances related to transactions between P&G legal entities that operate in different currencies. To continue the prior example while razors produced in Germany are being transported and are moving through the customs process into Russia, our Russian books hold a euro-denominated payable.","At the end of every quarter, working capital balances are revalued at current spot rates. Gains or losses from revaluing transactional working capital balances typically flow through SG&A and are included in core earnings per share. The only exception is the case of a fixed exchange rate currency that is also hyperinflationary. In this case, we need to revalue not just the foreign currency transactional balances, but also the local currency working capital balances. All of these impacts are reported in non-core earnings. The Venezuelan bolivar is the only currency that currently fits this definition.","Third, income statements of foreign subsidiaries like Russia that did not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency are translated back to U.S. dollars at new exchange rates. Just the Russian ruble transaction, balance sheet revaluation and translation impacts have been and are projected to be significant at about $150 million, $100 million and $300 million after-tax, respectively for a total as I said earlier, of $550 million after-tax for the year.","Across all currencies, foreign exchange hurts totaled $450 million after-tax in the December quarter, $650 million fiscal year-to-date and are forecast to be at $1.4 billion after-tax profit curve [ph] over the course of the fiscal year. This is the most significant fiscal year currency impact we have ever incurred. The currencies of six countries, Russia, the Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina, Japan and now Switzerland account for over $1 billion of the $1.4 billion after-tax headwind from FX.","In the first five of these markets, we have larger businesses than nearly all of our multi-national competitors and we have a large Swiss franc exposure from our European headquarters in Geneva. In aggregate we have more than $8.8 billion of sales in these markets, 2 to 3 times our next largest competitor. Of the $1.4 billion hurt, about 30% is from transaction, about 20% is from balance sheet revaluation and the remaining 50% is from translation, because of these impacts the outlook for the fiscal year will remain challenging.","We have and will continue to offset as much of this currency impact as we can through pricing and productivity cost savings. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our businesses, brands, product innovation and capabilities because it's the right thing to do for the mid and long term. We'll adjust fiscal year targets accordingly as I'll cover when we get to guidance.","Now as these FX impacts flow through the income statement they obviously impact margins. Core gross margin was down 20 basis points in the December quarter, excluding foreign exchange it was up 40 basis points. Cost savings of approximately 190 basis points and 60 basis points of improvement from higher pricing were offset by 110 basis points of mix, 50 points from innovation and capacity investments and 50 basis points from commodity cost increases.","While we're beginning to benefit from lower fuel prices which reduced transportation costs, the costs of materials such as resin and other specialty chemicals were still higher in the December quarter than in the prior year. Pulp is also up year-on-year. If oil stays at or around current levels, these material costs headwinds should turn to tailwinds by the fourth quarter of the fiscal year.","Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased about 30 basis points excluding FX they were down 80 basis points. 70 basis points of overhead savings and 70 basis points of marketing savings mainly from non-media cost efficiencies were more than offset by 120 basis points of foreign exchange impact and 50 basis points of organizational capability investments in R&D and sales. Productivity savings and cost of goods sold and SG&A totaled 330 basis points as we continue to meet or beat all of our productivity objectives. Core operating margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year including FX and was up 120 basis points excluding FX. The effective tax rate on core earnings was 22.3%, 130 basis points above last year's rate. This keeps us on track with our fiscal year outlook of about 21%.","December quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $0.82 which include approximately $0.03 per share of non-core restructuring charges and a $0.06 per share benefit from earnings of the discontinued batteries and pet care operations. Also included was a $0.26 per share one-time, non-core, non-cash charge as we explained during our analyst day in November to adjust the carrying value of the battery business.","It was a strong cash quarter, we generated $3.4 billion in operating cash flow and $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow with 95% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, $1.8 billion in dividends and $1.9 billion in share repurchase. Fiscal year-to-date we have returned $7.9 billion to shareholders, $3.6 billion in dividends and $4.3 billion in share repurchase.","In summary, second quarter organic sales and constant currency core earnings growth were in-line with going-in expectations. Productivity savings continued at or ahead of plans with constant currency growth and operating margins well ahead of year ago and we continued our strong track record of cash productivity and cash return to shareholders. We're maintaining investments necessary to support our brands and product innovations.","These include continuous strategic investment in breakthrough product innovations like Gillette ProGlide Flexball and our entry into the adult incontinence category with Always Discreet as well as investments to restore the competitive value equation of leading brands like Bounty and Charmin. We will strike what we believe to be the appropriate balance between short-term FX cost recovery and investment to support the mid and long term health of our business.","We will continue our efforts to focus our portfolio, to lead business model and product innovation to become ever more productive and cost efficient and to execute with excellence. As we announced in August, we're taking a significant and strategic step forward to streamline, simplify and strengthen the company's business and brand portfolio. We will become a simpler, more focused company of 70 to 80 category-leading competitively advantaged brands organized into about a dozen business units in four industry based sectors.","We will compete in businesses that are structurally attractive and that play to P&G strengths where we can achieve sustainable advantage. Every brand we plan to keep is strategic with the potential to grow and create value with 70 to 80 brands are leaders in their industries, categories or segments brand shoppers buy, consumers use and customers support. They are leaders in brand equity, awareness, trial, purchase and loyalty.","They are leaders in product performance and product innovation and leaders in growth and value creation. Within these brands, we will operate with more efficient brand product line and SKU offerings, reducing SKUs 15% to 20% over the next two years. We will create a faster growing, more profitable company that is far simpler to operate. We have been progressing this work at a healthy pace. In November, we announced plans to exit the Duracell business through a split transaction in which we will exchange a recapitalized Duracell company for Berkshire Hathaway's shares of P&G stock.","We expect to complete the deal in the second half of this calendar year. While we're progressing very well, those of you who have built your fiscal 2016 models assuming a July 1st closing and related share count reduction are probably a quarter or two too aggressive. In late December, we closed the divesture of the European pet care business and respective brands. We also signed and communicated a deal to divest Camay and Zest soap brands.","To-date we have divested, discontinued or consolidated 35 brands. As we continue to strengthen our category and brand portfolio, we will focus our brand building and product innovation, support and investment against the biggest consumer and market opportunities. We're committed to be or become the brand and product innovation leader in the categories in which we compete.","Year-after-year, decade-after-decade successful brand building and product innovation have grown our categories, created entirely new categories, built our business and have been a major source of value creation. Innovation combats commoditization, stimulates category growth and builds the cumulative advantage of our brands over time. Our biggest business by far is Baby Care and the Pampers brand. Our biggest country is the United States.","As first reported last month at analyst day, we continue to stimulate category growth at 2% to 3% over the last year, reversing a multi-year decline. The Pampers business model that focuses on stimulating point-of-market entry demand and trade up to mom preferred, better performing and premium-priced products like the unique Swaddlers innovation and better performing better value point-of-entry products from Luvs have resulted in broad and sustainable category growth that benefits retailers, suppliers and manufacturers and has grown share for P&G.","Our U.S. diaper share is now 44%, up 2 points versus a year ago. We've turned a 10 point share disadvantage into an 8-point category leadership advantage over the past five years. Both Pampers and Luvs are growing share. Pampers Swaddlers share is up 3 points to an absolute category share of 12%. We're bringing diaper pants to market. We just introduced Pampers Premium Care Pants in Russia where the [inaudible] accounts for 23% of the market. Pampers Pants provide exceptional skin comfort and dryness benefits in an underwear-like design. The Russia launch is off to a very good start with shipments about 50% ahead of target.","We'll be bringing Pants to China this month and Latin America next quarter. Achieving a fair share of the global diaper pant market represents up to a $2 billion growth opportunity. Our strategy for Fabric Care in the U.S., our second biggest business, is having a similar positive impact for P&G and for category growth. It begins with creating and delivering a consumer preferred mix of brands, products and values.","Nearly a year ago, we introduced a strengthened Fabric Care brand and product lineup that significantly broadened consumer appeal. Essentially, we offered shoppers a full range of brands and products priced from about $0.15 to $0.28 a laundry load, including broadened POD offerings, new and improved liquid detergent options and Tide Simply Clean and Fresh, a preferred brand and product for consumers interested in value at an affordable price. As a result, Tide and Gain have both grown market share over the past 52, 26, 13 and 4-week periods. Tide now holds a 40 share. Gain is the number two brand at a 16 share.","PODS have reached an 11 share of the U.S. market and P&G's share of that segment has grown above 80. We're seeing the first indication of category sales stability and even growth in recent weeks which is good for retailers, suppliers and manufacturers. This is the first category growth in seven years. We continue to expand PODS around the world and to developed and developing markets and we expect unit [inaudible] to reach $1.5 billion in retail sales this fiscal year.","We're following a similar strategy in the fabric conditioner category, a smaller, but even faster growing core strategic business. The business model stimulates category growth by trading more consumers into the discretionary fabric conditioner product category be a meaningful product like scent beads and liquid products that deliver better, functional and sensory benefits. Beads alone will deliver $400 million in global sales this fiscal year.","We continue to grow our Downy and Lenor brands in established markets, while we expand effectively into new countries where the size of the prize and the value creation return are attractive. P&G fabric conditioners are growing at about a 7% compound average growth rate, approaching $3 billion in global sales.","We're growing the grooming category and P&G's share behind the Gillette Flexball innovation. The male razor segment is up 17% on a unit volume basis over the last six months. Gillette's razor volume share was up 7% in the December quarter. As expected, we're beginning to see strong razor sales translate into an improved blade or cartridge share which was up 2 points in the December quarter. We're expanding Flexball right now to Europe, the Middle East and Africa and we're extending this breakthrough to women with Venus Swirl which began shipping in the U.S. this month. Women and men are telling us that they significantly prefer these products. It looks like Flexball may be the biggest most consumer-obvious new shaving system innovation ever introduced by Gillette.","Our Hair Care business is now growing share in both the U.S. and China. Pantene has now grown share seven months in a row in the U.S. and Head & Shoulders is up about 0.5 point in both markets, both brands are responding to improved products and better brand building. These brands in this category have a full pipeline of product innovation that will come to market this year and in the years ahead.","Pantene is shipping its new product line with formulations that work from the inside out to deliver on Pantene's promise of delivering the most beautiful, healthy hair so you shine. Head & Shoulders new product line delivers 100% dandruff free results and an improved in-use experience that enables consumers to feel the product working instantly. We're accelerating the growth of the adult incontinence category with Always Discreet. Women are not fully satisfied with current category product offerings.","One in three women over 18 years old suffers from incontinence, but only one in nine uses an incontinence product. Always Discreet pad and pant-style offerings deliver significantly better fit and protection from Always, a brand that women trust and prefer.","We begin shipments of Always Discreet in the UK in July and the U.S., Canada and France in August. In the UK, the adult incontinence category is growing double digits, roughly 50% faster since our entry. In the U.S., the category growth rate has more than doubled to around 9% and our shipments are running ahead of target in both markets with value share a little over 7% in each. We're continuing the expansion of Always Discreet with launches in Germany, Switzerland and Austria this quarter.","We're committed to be the innovation leader in our categories, to drive category growth and the growth of our businesses. And we're increasing investment where we have consumer preferred brands and products. In addition to innovation, productivity will continue to drive total shareholder return. The best companies in any industry find a way to lead both innovation and productivity. We're turning productivity into a core strength at P&G making it a systemic, enduring value creation pillar alongside innovation. We have significantly accelerated and will significantly exceed the $10 billion cost savings goal we set 2.5 years ago. We're driving cost of goods savings well above the original target run-rate of $1.2 billion a year, with $1.6 billion of savings this fiscal year.","We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% again this year, reducing staffing even as we add capacity and start up new production modules. We've begun work on what is probably the biggest supply chain redesign in the company's history. We're transforming our distribution network in the United States, consolidating customer shipments into fewer distribution centers. These centers are strategically located closer to key customers in key population centers, enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper.","All six of the new mixing centers will be operational by the end of February, on or ahead of schedule and we expect to complete the conversion out of legacy locations this calendar year. The distribution network projects will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels, while still improving service and on-shelf availability and reducing in-store out of stocks. We have established a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation target from the global supply chain reinvention effort.","We're targeting to deliver $400 million to $600 million in annual cost savings building to this level over the next three to five years. These savings are incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we originally communicated and are on track to exceed. We expect additional top and bottom-line benefits from improved service levels. We continue to invest strategically in additional capacity for critical developing markets and we continue to rationalize our manufacturing processes so that common, simpler and more global standard making and packing platforms support accelerated product innovation at lower cash, capital and operating costs. This enables not only better and cheaper, but also more agile, flexible and faster. We have reduced non-manufacturing or overhead enrollment, by nearly 18%, 80% more than we initially envisioned when we launched our restructuring program.","We continue to evolve the organization design so that is business focused starting with consumers and customers and so that it is simpler, more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We've organized around industry-based sectors. We're streamlining and de-duplicating the work of the business units and selling operations. We've consolidated four brand building functions into one. Each of these changes reduces complexity and each creates clear accountability for performance and results, a more focused portfolio of brands and businesses will enable further changes. We should be close to the high end of our estimated 16% to 22% non-manufacturing enrollment reduction range by the end of this fiscal year, more than a year ahead of plan.","We have additional opportunity to improve marketing efficiency in both media and non-media areas while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and the strength of our programs. We continue to drive marketing productivity through an optimized mix driven by new, more efficient digital media. We have quietly strengthened and invested in all of our digital capabilities including mobile, search and social with a wide range of partners. More than 30% of our working media is now digital.","We have developed proprietary systems to target digital media more precisely and more efficiently. Three of our brand communications designed specifically for digital were among the top 10 YouTube viewings in 2014. These efficiencies are enabling us to maintain strong media weights despite the cost pressure we're facing from foreign exchange. We're focused on driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet, disciplined working capital management, strong execution of our supply chain financing program and the scarcity mentality and capital spending are driving cash flow results.","One of the productivity related questions we often hear concerns developing market margins. We're growing constant currency earnings margins in developing markets. Constant currency earnings grew two times faster than sales in 2013, four times faster than sales in 2014 and are forecast to grow four times faster than sales again this year. Over those three years, we will have grown constant currency earnings 12%, 26% and 26%, respectively. Even with the unprecedented FX impact, we're making progress. Our margin all-in in Latin America is forecast to be up more than a point this year. In the BRIC markets, Brazil and India should each be up about 4 points and China should hold its industry leading margin.","Russia is forecast to be done a few points because the pricing intended to recover the FX impacts will not be fully in place until the spring. In total, though, we're forecasting developing market margins including FX to be up about 60 basis points for the year. The final priority area I'll touch on this morning is execution, the only strategy our consumers and customers actually see. For many of our big brands, building trial is still a huge opportunity; for example, repurchase rates on unit dose laundry detergents are over 50%, but trial rates are barely double-digits.","We have a number of programs underway to increase trial on our brands. In several categories in many countries, we have an opportunity to improve coverage, dedication and in-store merchandising of our brands. We're investing selectively in dedicated sales coverage of merchandising to improve execution for shoppers in-store and online. This should lead to improved distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing execution to consistently win at the first moment of truce. We're also continuing to grow our e-Commerce business with omnichannel and pure-play e-tailers as shoppers evolve their shopping preferences and habits.","As we look beyond the January-March quarter, we're hopeful that industry and company tailwinds will begin to improve. Productivity should continue to grow. The benefits from portfolio strengthening and simplification should continue to build. Pricing should help. Oil-based commodity costs should become a tailwind by the fourth quarter. Beyond the cost-benefit lower energy prices will hopefully become a stimulant to demand in petroleum importing countries.","The world's Top 15 oil importing countries which include the U.S., China, Japan and many Western European markets, account for nearly 2\/3rds of P&G's global sales and an even higher share of profits. Interest rates should remain low and we hold out hope for a sequentially stronger economy in the United States, our largest market.","But there will continue to be headwinds. Foreign exchange is obviously at the top of the list and has a significant short-term impact, pricing to recover that impact, taken by both P&G and other industry players is likely to result in some market contraction and reduced consumption in several countries. Lower commodity costs will create a consumption headwind in energy producing countries and political instability will continue to result on some ongoing amount of market level disruption.","In a time of unprecedented currency devaluation that impacts our company more than any other in our industry, it's important to stay balanced. We need to balance doing what's right for the short, mid and long term. We need to balance the focus on delivering operating cash flow in the short term and continuing to deliver good returns for shareholders with continuing to invest in our businesses, brands, products, capabilities and people for the mid- and long term health of the company.","We're maintaining our forecast for organic sales growth of low- to mid-single digits for the fiscal year. We delivered 2% organic sales growth in the first half of the year and we could see a modest acceleration in the second half. Pricing should be a larger contributor to sales growth in the second half as price increases are more fully reflected in our results. We're seeing positive trends in big core businesses like U.S. Baby Care, Fabric Care and Grooming and Hair Care and we're continuing to expand several important product innovations, pants, PODS, beads, Flexball and Swirl, upgraded hair care products, Always Discreet.","We're also maintaining our outlook for double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. We expect foreign exchange to have a 12-point impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. This is more than double what we had estimated last quarter and more than five times the impact we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year.","Including FX, we now expect core earnings per share to be in-line to down low-single-digits versus last year core earnings per share of $4.09. We're now forecasting all-in sales to be down 3% to 4% for the fiscal year. This includes a 5 point drag from foreign exchange and a 1-point impact from minor brand divestitures. We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be down mid-teens versus the fiscal year -- prior fiscal year. Essentially all of the year-to-year reduction in GAAP earnings per share is due to the $0.58 of one-time, non-cash battery impairments.","In total, current year GAAP earnings per share includes $0.67 per share of non-core items. In addition to impairments, the other main items are $0.20 per share of restructuring costs and about $0.14 of gains in discontinued operations from the combination of the Duracell and pet businesses. We're currently forecasting 96% adjusted free cash flow productivity, above guidance of at least 90%. We're maintaining our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We plan to return cash to share owners through dividend payments of about $7 billion and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, $10 billion to $12 billion all-in.","This forecasting guidance range assumes mid-January spot rates for foreign exchange. Further, significant currency weakness, including Venezuela, is not anticipated within our guidance range. Our outlook is based on current market growth rates which we're monitoring closely, especially in markets where we taking large price increases to offset currency impacts. We also continue to monitor unrest in several markets in the Middle East, Russia and the Ukraine and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina where pricing controls, import restrictions and access to dollars can present risk.","On the flip side, our guidance does not reflect some potential tailwinds. Our results can improve if currencies ease, if markets begin to expand in a sustainable way or if U.S. economic growth accelerates. There are a few things you should keep in mind as you construct your models for the second half of the year. Our organic sales comps ease a bit in the back half of the year and we're taking significant pricing to offset foreign exchange impacts.","We expect significant top and bottom line headwinds from foreign exchange in the back half of the year, including a large negative impact from balance sheet revaluation related to the Swiss franc in the March quarter. There is also a quarterly translation hit to earnings as we're operationally net short to Swiss franc due to the significant local cost structure related to our Europe and India, Middle East and Africa headquarters in Geneva. Productivity savings will build as the year progresses and we expect sequential improvement in commodity costs as we go through the remainder of the year.","Stepping back, we're not only investing in our brands and products, but also in critical company capabilities that will enable much better consumer and customer responsiveness with systems that are more agile, faster, better and cheaper. We have talked about the supply chain, the overall goal is a seamless and synchronized flow of information and product with shoppers, customers, retailers and e-tailers.","Our strategies continue to sharpen. Our category and brand business models continue to improve. Our product innovation pipeline continues to fill. Our productivity yield continues to grow with several more years of significant cash and cost savings ahead. We're operationalizing plans more consistently and executing them more broadly and reliably. We continue to invest strategically in additional capacity for critical developing markets and we continue to rationalize our manufacturing processes, so that common, simpler and more globally standard making and packing platforms support accelerated product innovation at a lower cash, capital and operating costs.","We continue to evolve the organization design so that it is business focused, starting with consumers and customers, simpler more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We continue to invest selectively in sales coverages and merchandising to improve execution for shoppers in stores and online and we continue to invest in product innovation technologies and product initiative acceleration.","Through this transformation, we're creating a more in touch, agile, coordinated and integrated organization that puts winning with the consumer first. We're sharpening our strategies and business models. We're operationalizing plans and executing with more consistency and excellence. These are the choices and capabilities that enable balanced growth and value creation in the mid and long term as we work our way through the currency devaluations in the short term.","That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which we posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call.","With that, I would be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson from Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","My question has to do with the multiplier effect between the currency pressure on your top line and bottom line because it's just so much bigger than we see at any other company and my question is how much of that I've how much of that is going to go away and this is sort of a long term strategic issue how much that is going to go away as you get your new plans any manufacturing facilities online and emerging markets is that just a structural thing whenever going to have more three raises in place plans disproportionate significantly on our earnings.","Jon Moeller","Clearly as it is apparent you understand from your question, the difference between the top line and bottom line impact FX is driven by sourcing. And were product is being manufactured and imported two. And it also has to do with where we're disproportionately sized versus our competitors just in terms of our business footprint.","We disproportionately impacted due to our business size and market position in countries that have seen some of the highest levels of devaluations. In Venezuela, Russia, the Ukraine and Japan, we have significant businesses and we estimate that in those markets our top and bottom I impacts are more than double our top multinational competitors and then we're also importing significant amount of product in the markets like Venezuela into markets like Argentina into markets like Russia and Japan. We're working as we rightly point out to further localize our manufacturing supply chain over time and that should help as we go forward.","We're building roughly 20 new manufacturing facilities, all of which are in developing markets which are the ones that have been most impacted by foreign exchange. As we do that and even with our existing manufacturing platforms, we're working to localize our suppliers with us. As I mentioned in the example on the ruble, this is both a cost in terms of importation product but also importing materials and the more that we can localize both of those components of the supply chain the better off we're going to be in terms of being operationally hedged to FX. The issue will never go away and its entirety.","Again, think you mentioned a very good example on blades and razors. We're not going to have 180 blades and razors manufacturing facilities but we're localizing to a greater extent even that supply chain. With significant investments we made for example in Mexico. So, hopefully, this will continue to reduce as we move forward but it is not likely to ever completely disappear.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara","Jon, I guess obviously FX drives and need for pricing. Jon, I think you said you're going to be more aggressively taking pricing in the back half. But I guess the question is with crude at 45, was there a risk that we get into a situation like '08 - '09 where you can price more than peers and ended up losing share?","Jon Moeller","Fair question and that's, obviously, something we're going to watch very carefully. The good news if you want to call it that is in markets where the most significant pricing is needed, the currency impacts far overwhelmed the energy costs impacts. So again going back to our example of Russia with 78% currency devaluation we might not be able to recover all of that and certainly we're going to have to take into account both competitive consumer dynamics which will reflect the commodity cost environment as well. So we'll watch that carefully. That's also why as I talk about the efforts to offset FX, I always mentioned as well productivity and cost savings. There is going to have to be a higher component of that this time around for the reason you cite as well as for the simple reason that our euro and yen domicile competitors don't have as much of a headwind as we have. So we're going to have to approach this very deliberately, very carefully. But still I think there is a significant opportunity for pricing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher","Want to talk a little bit about the organic revenue growth guidance here and you talked about an improving trends in the second quarter, can you talk about what you are seeing? Potentially what you're seeing in the third? And then going back to -- looking at this -- why not just take it down to low-singles, I guess from that standpoint. Not that I think many people are pricing in it but it seems a little overly optimistic and then, sort of looking at Chris's question here, what's the outlook if you look at things getting better sequentially in terms of the volume versus pricing breakdown? Is it all going to be pricing as things get better in the back half of the year? Do you think you can get volumes improving? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So first of all, low single-digit organic sales growth is as you know covered within our guidance range and we're going to have to -- there is both tailwinds and headwinds going forward here. We have seen some pickup in the U.S. market as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, volume was up two points in the developed markets in the quarter and we have seen an increase in the market growth rate in the U.S. And if that continues, that's obviously our biggest market and our most profitable market that could be a real benefit to the top line. We have several businesses where we have admittedly struggled recently but where we believe the fix is right around the corner. I mentioned in our prepared remarks the family care business, that's a big business for us in North America where we've been losing share. We've adjusted pricing on that business and are starting to see both volume and sales respond. So, hopefully, that picks up for us.","Another big business that I didn't mention in the prepared remarks is Mexico. If we look at sales in Mexico were down almost 20% on the quarter, it constitutes almost a full point of organic sales growth. So if it were not for Mexico we would've rounded it to 3%. And the driver there is a combination of three things. There is a consumption tax increase which was put in place January a year ago. So that's annualizing on the consumption impacts of that are annualizing. We also took pricing to deal with the value in peso and we changed some of our trade terms to pricing transparency in the marketplace. All of that should begin to annualize here very shortly. So if we continue to make progress, if we continue the growth that we have on some of our big brands, if we can address a few of the admitted challenges that we have, I mentioned China as another example, there is no reason we couldn't get up into pick up another point of growth. And then we will have to see what happens as we price as Chris mentioned as you rightly mentioned to market sizes in some of these other markets. I would say quite honestly there is more uncertainty in the top line and there has been in sometimes because of all these variables. But there is both positive variables and variables to watch out for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","I guess two things. One was just to clarify that last point, Jon, that when you say pick up another point of growth that you meant another point in the back half not another point on the full-year from the 2% run-rate?","Jon Moeller","Yes.","Lauren Lieberman","Perfect. The other thing was on the other promotional environment in the U.S. I think Unilever's comments were pretty direct around their savings be it on commodities or obviously currency benefits being reinvested in past back to the consumer. So was curious about your view of the promotional environment particularly in the U.S. and then also specifically looking at beauty. It just feels like there is -- this is anecdotal, but it feels like the year has started off in a very, very promotional way. So I was just curious about particularly on beauty that would be great.","Jon Moeller","Okay let me start way on macro and then I will get down to micro including beauty. In general as you know, promotion is the last place we would like in most cases to spend a dollar, we would rather spend it on equity or innovation and if you just look at the drivers of our top line growth over time, I think that it bears that out. So in the quarter that we just completed pricing inclusive of promotion was a one point benefit to the top line, it's been a benefit for 16 consecutive quarters, it's been a benefit for 10 consecutive years. So it doesn't mean that we won't have individual product categories that are up and down at a given time given both the trial needs of innovation we're putting into the market and the competitive situation but broadly that is not our game.","Reflecting just on the U.S. market, so the first point of your question, if we look at the indices for percentage of volume sold a promotion over the last four quarters, the indices sequentially have been a one-to-one, this is all business category business not just P&G, 101, 103, 101 and 98. So broadly, that's not indicative of an environment that's heavily promotional. Now, again within individual product categories of course there are differences. And to be fair those figures that I just provided you don't include couponing, but they don't include couponing at the base period either. So they are kind of free of that.","On P&G Beauty we did increased promotion a little bit particularly on hair care behind some of the product I mentioned that are driving share growth on Pantene and Head & Shoulders. It's very important particularly on Pantene given some of the struggle that we went through prior to the last that seven months that we give opportunities to consumers to experience and re-experience and retry our brands. So there has been some level of promotional increase but again most of our spending is on equity building and innovation and will remain that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","On M&A and the pairing down of your portfolio, do the current market dynamics change your thinking anyway a brand brands or businesses that might be up for divesture or harvesting including the time of [inaudible]? And conversely as you speak with potential inquirers I suspect some of them might be overseas without going into specifics, have your discussions have been impacted in any way as map [ph] changes for that?","Jon Moeller","We view the strategic were making on the portfolio as a long-term strategic move and so the impact of one year in FX either positive or negative doesn't dramatically change that. And in my conversations with potential buyers, they seem to be similarly oriented. They're looking at longer periods of time. Now you can imagine that there are specific situations where let's say you have a large component of the business that happens to be operating in Russia or the Ukraine or name a couple of markets, that certainly -- I wouldn't say that it affects buyers strategic interests but it affects, obviously, the tone of the overall conversation as it should but I view that really as on a margin on the whole as the years of all and as the currency situation has worsened. Honestly I can't think of one conversation that we've been holding with potential buyers that has changed dramatically in terms of its tone as a result of currency. So I think we're full steam ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley","Dara Mohsenian","Jon, you highlighted the recent volume pickup in the U.S. and it looks clearly like retail sales growth has accelerated the last couple of months in the scanner data including through mid-January release today. That being said, the two year average look relatively stable given easier comps the last couple of months in the scanner data. I just want to get a sense from you on how much of the recent U.S. top line rebound in your mind is due to a more sustainable U.S. consumer recovery or is it more easier comps? And then second on pricing can you give us a bit more granularity on how much of the FX pressure this you think you can eventually recover through pricing and also from a commodity standpoint given its expected return to a tailwind by Q4, do you expect to get a margin windfall at some point looking out to fiscal 2016 or do you think that will be priced back to the marketplace? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Sorry, I was struggling there to remember all components of this. I'm going to start from the back and go to the front. On commodities, if oil stayed at current prices we would expect an annualized benefit of about $600 million before tax that should start flowing through in the fourth quarter. If you look at the combination of our contractual lags and our inventories, on average they are six to seven weeks, so the recent moves should start coming through really by the very end of this quarter, but more fully in the fourth quarter and we will just have to see what happens in terms of what competitors do relative to pricing. Having the FX issues at the same time, though, directionally moves us in a position of expecting more pricing rather than less. But you're right to point it out as something that we need to watch.","Historically in FX moves like this, not identical to this because this is one of the bigger ones we've ever seen, but historically, we've been able to recover over time about 50% to 2\/3rds of the impact through pricing and then we get the balance through productivity savings. My sense is we're going to have to move that balance and maybe this time we will get 40% or 50%. We'll see.","We're going to have to depend more on productivity savings to get there. The good news is we've got a very strong productivity program that we have visibility on for a couple of years going out. So that's how I look at pricing in general.","On your question on the U.S., of how much of that is just better comps and how much of its market, again, I would just point to the market growth rates which are up about 0.5 point in the U.S. So at least that portion of it is due to the market and then I mentioned that we're holding or building share in businesses representing more than 60% of sales. So there is an element there of share growth as well, all of that combined with the easier comps driving the data.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmidt with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmidt","Three questions. The first is there a concrete turnaround plan in China? Because it seems like it's been two or three years now with share losses in a lot of big categories and I know you guys understand that there is a problem there but I haven't really heard anything concretely what you are going to do to turn it around. And then on the divestitures, I know you said 35 brands have been sold. Can you tell us what percentage of the 10% of sales you're done with there? And then the last one, which is more technical, how big magnitude-wise is going to be the Swiss franc impact in the March quarter? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So again I'll start with the last one. There should be about an $80 million after-tax balance sheet revaluation impact from the Swiss franc in the third quarter and then we will have the translation issue as well. As I mentioned, we're short the franc overall and that's driven by the fact that we have a very large cost base there. Our European and Eastern European, Middle East, Africa headquarters are there and Switzerland is a small country so we have proportionately less volume. So that will be an impact from a balance sheet evaluation in the third quarter and from a translation standpoint in both the third and the fourth quarters.","On China, we've built that business. We've grown about 50% over the last four years; it's now our second largest business in both sales and profit. There are two things that we're working to improve in China. One, quite frankly is the amount of price transparency that exists in the marketplace. I think the market in general has become over the last year or so, last two years, a little bit too promotional in nature which tends to happen when you have major changes in consumption patterns. But it's created a degree of opacity in terms of consumers and customers understanding the true value equation that exists and we need to fix that.","I think in general the industry is working to fix that and that's why you see some of the impacts that you've seen from some of the other manufacturers in terms of their results in China as well and I would say that we're in the fifth inning in terms of getting that squared around. And then as I mentioned in several categories discussions previously, there is just a massive opportunity in China as that market [inaudible]. If you look at that market by price tier, the premium and super premium price tier, so the top two price tiers now represent 50% of consumption in the market, so across competitors and those tiers are growing at 11%. The balance of the market is flat.","In some categories, we haven't followed the consumer as quickly as we needed to up that price ladder, that's part of the issue on Olay. We're not yet where we want to be for instance, on Pampers. Though as I mentioned, the premium pant product coming to market this month will help significantly.","So those are really two of the areas generally that we're focused on, on dealing with China, but again, there is huge opportunity in that market","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from UBS","Steve Powers","Jon, a question on Beauty, maybe following up a little bit about your comments there just on Olay. I guess it continues to be a work in progress with organic growth negative despite successes like Pantene domestically. Can you talk just a little bit more about the key initiatives there and what is likely to change versus stay the same given David Taylor's new appointment to that segment? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","I mentioned the progress on Pantene and the Hair Care portfolio broadly which we're very encouraged by. On Olay, we actually did fairly well in the U.S. in the last quarter. I think we were up about 3%, John, can get that number right for you afterwards, but I think that's pretty close. But we're still working in several other parts of the world as I mentioned to increase the salience of the brand in terms of both the channels, the price tiers and the product benefits that consumers are looking for in skin care products and that's work that takes some time.","I would say we're still in the early days there. We have people working on that business who have deep experience in skin care have been associated historically with the better days on Olay and so we continue to be very hopeful that will come around.","David, frankly, brings a new set of eyes which can only help and has tremendous brand building experience across many of our product categories. He's managed in the beauty business before, he managed our hair care business in China when he and I were working in China together in the mid-90s and so that's only good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets.","Nik Modi","Most of my questions were asked but I was curious, Jon, if you can talk about pricing analytics at P&G and over the last couple of years if you've seen an evolution or increased sophistication, more accuracy because if you go back the last couple of years on the pricing, it really led to a multi-quarter kind of string of share losses. So I'm just curious if you kind of sharpened some of the analytics on the pricing side? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Yes, the first thing I would say, Nik, is the primary metric that we're looking at as we analyze pricing choices both up and down is value creation and that may mean and I don't want to overstate this that there may be such situations where it's right to accept some share loss to get the structural economics to an attractive place in our brands. In terms of, though knowing if value creation is the primary metric, whether we're delivering that or not on a real-time basis, we have been constantly working to improve our analytical capability.","I won't say that we're all the way to where we need to be and I mentioned that's an investment in capabilities and this is one of the area, analytics in general that we're investing in, but simple things like our sales force being in the field as opposed to being in the office working on brand work will only help in terms of understanding what's happening on a real-time basis. Also as I mentioned, I think in response to John's question we're going to be depending just as much on productivity as we're pricing to try to deal with this FX issue and that was not the case in the years that John mentioned.","We didn't have the productivity program and certainly didn't have it at the level that we have it now. So we were more dependent on pricing as a way to restore those structural economics. But this is obviously something that we have to stay close to as you rightly point out and as several others have and is something that we will. We will not get it right every time. We cannot predict competitive behavior; we can't completely predict consumer behavior and so there will be some steps forward and some steps backward. But hopefully, the net is forward as it has been historically.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","My question is on Beauty and particularly on Prestige. It seems like it led the decline of the [inaudible] this quarter and more broadly when you talk about the portfolio you basically said it's structurally attractive categories that play to Proctor's strength and I wonder whether you would say that channel source specific Prestige Beauty and professional hair care do you think that plays to Proctor's strength or not? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","A large part of the trend in Prestige is driven by a very strong base period where we had a very strong innovation program. So that's primarily what's going on there. I think your question on fit with P&G's core capabilities and strengths is a good question and an appropriate question. I'll just provide a quick refresher on those capabilities and strengths because they do provide along with structural attractiveness and track record, the screens through which we look at our portfolio strategy and those core strengths are branding, innovation, consumer understanding, go-to-market and benefiting where appropriate from our scale.","And I've given the example before on our pharmaceuticals business where if you go across those capabilities, consumer understanding not terribly relevant, brand building, advertising, only legally permissible in three countries in the world, innovation challenged just because of the model in the industry, go-to-market, grocery stores, mass merchants, doctors.","That's a clear example of a business that doesn't benefit from our core capabilities. Our job in that case becomes to find somebody who does have those capabilities who can create more value than we can create and then monetize some of that value for our shareholders. We have gotten out of businesses because of channel fit in the past. I would argue that the pet care choice was in part related to that.","There was a specialty pet channel; there was an influencer channel with both the breeders and veterinarians that we did not have broader company expertise in. So those are the kinds of things that we will be looking at as we finalize portfolio choices.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.","Michael Steib","My question relates to how you expect mix to impact earnings going forward in the second half in particular? It was obviously a tailwind on the top line growth this quarter but a drag on gross margin. I wonder why that is and how you expect that to drive earnings going forward?","Jon Moeller","Basically in a scenario where we have relatively similar growth rates between developed and developing markets and where we have relatively similar growth rates across our product segments. So in other words, Beauty grows faster than it did in the last quarter, but the mix impact is not significant. In quarters where one of those -- two things aren't true, so where developing markets grow disproportionately or where our higher margin businesses like Beauty don't grow as fast as the rest of the portfolio. We will have a mix impact on the bottom line and so it really comes down to your estimation of those two drivers going forward as to what the mix impact is going to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.","Connie Maneaty","I do have a question on Venezuela. I appreciated your commentary about all the components in FX impact and in that context I'm wondering why you're still reporting your results at the official rate given where SICAD 2 is and where the parallel rate is? So can you quantify for us the move of your Venezuela results from SICAD 1 to SICAD 2?","Jon Moeller","We provide all of our exposures in our disclosures because we know this is an important item for investors. I haven't actually done the math, but you can, the reason that we continue to translate our results at a combination of SICAD 1, which is 11 to 12 and then the 6.3 official rate is simply because those are the rates at which we're transacting business in Venezuela.","We're getting dollars at those rates for imports of both finished product and raw materials. We're told that dividends and royalties would be paid for example, at the SICAD 1 rate, right now as I think you may be aware, the Government of Venezuela's working through as I understand it modifications to the exchange regime. I don't have transparency or visibility into that.","Obviously, we will look at that and understand really what's the rate at which we're going to be transacting business and that's the rate that we should be translating our results at. Importantly, I'm in no way suggesting that others will come to different outcomes or are doing anything that's wrong or incorrect. For them it should reflect what rates they are transacting business at.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Just two quick ones, I guess. First, how much of the pricing you've taken so far or announced to the trade has been matched by competitors? And here I'm specifically talking about the developed world not developing and then, secondly was there anything unusual in the month of December organic growth of 5% because previous to that, if you look at October-November it looks like your flat to modestly down going into that month and I would imagine there was probably some pre-buying or pull forward ahead of some price increases? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Joe, broadly without going into detail because we can't do that, our pricing is going to be centered on the developing markets. There is not a lot of developed market pricing that is planned. As a result and because of the timing of certain moves, it is still early days in terms of understanding both what the competitive and what the consumer dynamics are going to be. Maybe we will have an update for you at CAGNY, but even that will probably be too soon. We're in the early days there, but again, the main point is most of this we focused on developing markets not on developed markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Bill Chappell","Just actually following up on Bill Schmidt's question which I'm not sure I got the answer to, percentage of sales that the 35 brands that you've divested or consolidated represents of kind of that total 10% and whether that 10% number is actually change as you have started to look at the portfolio a little bit closer? And then also with regard to -- I didn't really understand what you're saying in terms of the timing of the shares coming back in a little bit later from the Duracell divesture, so maybe can you help me understand that too?","Jon Moeller","Yes, all helpful and thanks for reminding me of the other part of Bill's question. You know what the Duracell sales are, you know what the pet sales are, they have all been moved to discontinued operations and we've given you the amounts of those moves that have been made and those are the two largest. And then, there is a bunch of smaller things. I think you can get pretty close to an estimate with a little bit of thumb in the air on where we're at. The number is not a static number, it does change. We have said very clearly that we intend to create value as we exit businesses.","It doesn't make any sense to exit a business if we can't create value in the process and so by definition, we haven't made definitive choices on what goes and what stays as we're still working to negotiate terms and see if we can in fact, create sufficient value in some instances. So that's not a static figure that was a figure that was designed to get us close. Oh shares, thank you. I mentioned that -- as I've read several of your updates from the sell side, we obviously haven't given you a lot of direction other than saying sometime in the second half we will close the transaction with Berkshire Hathaway on Duracell and retire those shares.","And so I've seen a number of the estimates, understandably picking different time points and one of them being July 1st and my only point is while we're making good progress, I don't expect that this will be complete by July 1st. I do expect it will be completed in the second half of the calendar year, but I think July 1st is aggressive as you model the retiring of those shares.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","So believe it or not I still have a question around FX and I get that you're guiding everything organically effectively the same and you're attributing the guide down to FX alone. But I guess, why is that good enough? So why aren't we seeing things like some of your peers are doing that's more aggressive internally to offset some of those impacts? We've talked a little bit about pricing, but productivity, it doesn't seem like it's ramping up, at least it doesn't look like it yet. It certainly looks like your investing in some areas in SG&A and I'm certainly mindful of the word that you used earlier, balance. But what are you doing internally to pull in the belt a little bit more given the headwinds from currency that you are facing?","Jon Moeller","First of all, I think if we step back and look at constant currency earnings growth that we're forecasting for the year and guiding to, it's double-digit. So that's not an insignificant number and I get asked just as frequently and I think appropriately, if that isn't too much as I do if that isn't too little and it all comes back to this balance point.","If you look at our competitors, I mentioned in response to Wendy's question whether we like it or not our impacts from FX are more significant than some of our competitors simply because of our footprint and obviously we have others that are as you know either euro or yen domiciled or have largely a U.S. focus of their footprint. And so even with that double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth, we end up at or slightly below a year ago. We will pull forward not necessarily -- we will execute any smart cost savings program.","I mentioned the fact that we're going to be close to the top end of our range on overhead reduction by the end of this year, that's more than a year ahead of pace. And again, is at the top of a 6 point range. So we're continuing to move pretty aggressively. But as you rightly point out and as we have tried to communicate, we need to do that in a balanced way. We just have so many things that present opportunity, both in the way that we operate in our long-term cost structure in delighting consumers with some of our brands, products and technologies that it would be the wrong answer to pull back from those.","So we will continue to be balanced. We will continue to be diligent and aggressive in terms of the identification of savings opportunities. Another one for example that we've talked about, granted it doesn't happen all this year, but getting those six mixing centers set up and operational by the end of February that was acceleration of a project that we did specifically to help deal with the current reality and we'll look for more opportunities like that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen","Jon, I think you mentioned earlier that volume actually declined in developing markets in the quarter. And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about that, is that a reflection of further slowing in consumption in developing markets? Or do you attribute it to this FX related pricing that you discussed and what your expectations are there going forward?","Jon Moeller","Quarter-to-quarter there was no significant change in developing market growth from a market standpoint. The one exception to that which is very difficult to sort out is Russia, which when you look at it actually the growth rate increased, but I think that's a large part purchase ahead of pricing that people know are coming.","But I would say the market is not a big driver of the small volume reduction we had in developing markets. One driver is one that you rightly point out which is foreign exchange. Where we haven't priced yet on some of the most recent moves like the big ruble move, we have been pricing in places like the Ukraine, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela obviously when that was legally allowed and so that is having some impact. And typically we see that having an impact in most cases for about a 12-month period, in more significant cases like Russia maybe a longer period of time.","The other impact is what I indicated which is some issues we've had in both Mexico that was, sales were down 20%. I'm not sure what the volume was but it was significant and in China, where we\u2019ve been kind of flattish. So those are two situations where we're working to improve. But really, markets with the exception of the unknown in Russia are pretty much holding quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

And welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.","Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures and adjusted for after-tax impacts of major divestitures. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding divestiture gains. Any measure described as Core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items P&G has posted on its website www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&Gs Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Bob McDonald and Teri List-Stoll. Our focus for the call this morning is our first quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year. I also want to touch on the key elements of and progress against our growth and productivity strategy, which will be the focus of our analyst meeting here in Cincinnati in a few weeks.","A business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides which will be posted on our website www.PG.com following the call, we'll take questions after our prepared remarks and we'll be available after the call to provide additional perspective as needed.","With that let me move to first quarter results, which were at the high end of our expectations on the top line and ahead of plan on operating profit earnings per share and cash. Our results position us well to deliver our plans for the fiscal year. We grew organic sales 2% at the high end of our 0% to 2% guidance range. Organic volume was equal to prior year levels and pricing added two points to organic sales growth.","Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales growth by six points leaving all-in sales down 4% also at the high end of our guidance range. Moving to the bottom line all-in earnings per share were $0.96. This includes $0.10 of non-core cost including $0.09 of non-core restructuring investments.","Core earnings per share were much longer than we had initially forecast at a $1.06 and increase of 5% first prior year. Better than expected earnings were driven by top of range sales growth lower commodity cost pressure than we have built into our original forecast and strong productivity progress.","Core operating profit margin grew 90 basis points including 150 basis points of productivity improvements and cost savings. Core gross margin improved 80 basis points. Cost savings and productivity helped gross margin by 100 basis points and pricing improved gross margin by roughly 100 basis points. These benefits were partially offset by 100 basis point negative impact from a combination of product and geographic mix. Commodity cost had a modest negative impact on gross margin for the quarter.","Core SG&A cost decreased 10 basis points as overhead cost savings of approximately 50 basis points were partially offset by increased plans and benefits cost, which we highlighted in our fiscal year guidance. The core tax rate was 24.3% within the expected range for the quarter. On an all-in basis, including restructuring costs gross margin improved 30 basis points and all-in operating profit margin declined 60 basis points. The decline in reported operating margin was due to non-core restructuring investments of 140 basis points.","We generated $2 billion in free cash flow in the quarter which was also ahead of our initial forecast. We continue to expect to deliver close to 90% cash flow productivity for the year. During the quarter, we returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareholders, $1.6 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchase.","Returning capital to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase remains a central pillar of our efforts to deliver superior returns. [Net] as I highlighted our first quarter results with high end of our expectations on the top line and ahead of plan on operating profit earnings per share and cash.","We're continuing to make progress against each of our strategic priorities maintaining strong, developing market momentum, strengthening our core developed market business, building a strong innovation pipeline and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvements.","We maintain strong growth momentum in developing markets in the September quarter with organic sales up 7%. We've seen underlying market growth rates soften a bit over the last four or five months. We've seen modest slowdowns in large markets such as China, Russia, Turkey, India and Brazil. We expect the innovation and marketing plans we have in place for the balance of the year will help to further accelerate share and sales growth despite slower market growth.","We're currently forecasting 8% to 9% organic sales growth in developing markets for the fiscal year. Important part of our developing market plans is continue deployment of our portfolio. We have over 20 new category country expansions scheduled this fiscal year or continuing the globalization of our Oral Care business.","We're nearing the completion of our rollout in Latin America and Western Europe. We recently launched Oral-B toothpaste in Venezuela, Greece and Portugal with several more markets to come over the next six months. We also launched Oral-B toothpaste in Israel this month.","In addition to toothpaste expansion, we're beginning to built out our whole oral care regimen. For example we launched Oral-B Whitestrips in Brazil earlier this month. This comes on top of our distribution expansion of toothpaste into high frequency stores in Brazil. Oral-B paste is now 7.5% national value share up 2.5 points versus last year.","Other recent developing market expansions include the launch of a full range of Vicks cough and cold products in Russia and Poland. Olay skin care in Israel and the launch of Safeguard in seven countries in Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ethiopia.","We're continuing to built scale in developing markets behind geographic expansion and market share progress. We're localizing production as our distribution footprint expands and consumer demand grows. Increased scale and lower supply chain cost are key drivers for the profit improvement we expect to deliver in our top developing markets this year. In aggregate we expect after tax profits in our top 10 markets to increase by about 35% versus last year, including negative foreign exchange impacts and around 50% on a local currency basis.","At the same time we're making progress in strengthening our core developed markets business. We're ensuring that we have sufficient plans to achieve our objectives in the 40 largest category country combinations, most of which are in developed markets and which account for about 50% of company's sales and 70% of operating profit.","We're working to ensure we have offerings that provide superior performance and value and our pricing is right, the innovation is strong that marketing effectively communicates the benefits of our products and that there is sufficient marketing support. These plans should be fully deployed and in market by January.","Our early interventions have begun to pay off. Market share trends have started to improve consistent with our forecast. We held or grew market share in businesses representing over 45% of sales in the September quarter up from 30% in the June quarter. You'll recall we made early interventions in four categories in the United States, laundry detergents, auto dish-washing detergents, Blades and Razors and Oral Care.","We're now growing value share in U.S. laundry detergents behind our -- excuse me -- innovation and consumer value corrections with the Tide brand up two and half points versus the prior year.","Market share in automatic dish washing has improved on a sequential basis to back above the 60% level, though we're still down slightly versus prior year. We're growing share in U.S. Blades and Razors, business with Fusion, Venus and disposables all up versus prior year and overall Blades and Razors share up more than a point.","Our market share in the U.S. toothpaste category is also growing up a point versus the prior year. Overall we're now holding or building share in businesses representing nearly 60% of the sales in the U.S. market up from about 15% of the June quarter. Underpinning all of our efforts in both developed and developing markets is a continued commitment to innovation.","Tide PODS is on pace to deliver nearly half a billion dollars in sales this fiscal year and trial rates are still growing at the strong pace. This is discontinuous innovation that is reframing value for consumers. They get the right amount of detergent and one easy step to achieve outstanding cleaning brightening in the stain removal results.","One of our competitors has indicated that the growth of the unit does form is hurting category volumes, our habits and practices research shows, that their consumers often use more than the recommended dosage of their powders and liquids to get the cleaning they need. In fact some of their consumers report using twice the recommended dosage or more which does create a volume risk for them if their consumers moved to the unit dose form. Tide powder and liquid consumers typically dose very close to the recommended level, given the efficacy of this products so we are not expecting in the significant volume impact.","Downy Unstopables with this newly introduced shimmer scent has achieved U.S. consumption levels nearly twice as high as expected and has beat expectations in expansion markets. Zequel has reached the 20% value share in U.S. sleep aids category making it a number 1 brand in sleep aid in terms of both units and value. We just introduced a new oral care line called Pro-Health For Life which includes a regimen of products across toothpaste, toothbrush, floss and rinse specifically designed for the oral health needs of the consumers over 50 years old.","In Salon Hair care Illumina Color from Wella Professional is off to strong side in Europe and will be launching this quarter in the U.S. Illumina is truly breakthrough providing enough to 70% more light reflection and superior hair protection compared to competitive offerings.","We've recently launched a wave of new prestige fragrances including Gucci Flora Garden, Escada Delicate Notes, Hugo Boss Nuit for women and our newest male fragrance brand, James Bond 007 and re-design or re-launch of the core Dolce & Gabbana Pour Homme and Pour Femme fragrances. These initiatives drove mid-single digit organic sales growth this quarter in the category pressured by slowing market growth.","Looking forward we'll be launching Cascade Platinum in U.S. in January. This follows the successful share of building launch of Fairy Platinum in Western Europe earlier this year. Cascade and Fairy Platinum not only doing excellent job of cleaning dishes but they remove hidden grease in the dish washer.","We have a large bundled initiatives coming across the Skin Care portfolio including Olay Total Effects CC cream, a restage of Olay Regenerist, the largest of the Olay Boutiques and the introduction of new mid tier boutique called Olay Fresh Effects which will be launched in January.","In Hair Care we also have a full portfolio of innovation. In July, we launched Pantene Beautiful Lengths, Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal, Head & Shoulders Damage Rescue and Head & Shoulders Deep Clean. This initiatives enabled P&G to grow Hair Care value share for two consecutive months including Head & Shoulders share up about half a point despite the recent competitive anti-dandruff shampoo launch.","We're following this with the recently announced launch of Pantene Expert collection which includes two super premium lines Age Defy and Advanced+ Keratin Repair price 200%-250% above the base Pantene line. We'll also be introducing a new mid-tier hair care line price at 50-75 index to the base Pantene shampoos and conditioners. Our super premium Pantene Expert collection in our new mid-tier line will be available in January.","In the March quarter, we'll be launching the first innovation that spans multiple Male Blades and Razors brands including both Fusion Pro Glide (Inaudible) and is qualified to bring to market. But we're making good progress and are building an increasingly promising pipeline of category and brand creating innovations.","Like innovation, productivity also underpins all of our developed and developing market efforts. In February, we established our five year $10 billion cost savings initiative, we're making good progress against this, and we'll not stop there. We now have plans to deliver $1.2 billion in savings this fiscal year in cost of goods sold. And so have established [stretch goals] beyond this targeting $1.4 billion. Our efforts in this area include a 5% net productivity increase across manufacturing operations, even as we add new manufacturing capacity and enrollment in developing markets.","We also include significant savings in raw material, transportation and warehousing cost. We're achieving efficiencies in marketing spend, particularly on non-media expenditures and are reinvesting these savings in the strength and developed market plan. On going basis, we'd expect the portion of these efficiencies to come to the bottom line.","We've been making solid progress in the area of overhead costs. In the July-September quarter, we delivered 1300 net roll reductions bringing the cumulative total to 3300 positions since we started the program. We expect roughly another 900 roll reductions by the end of the month bringing the totals of 4200. This puts us well ahead of pace to deliver the plan reduced 5700 rolls by the end of the fiscal year.","Now that we're well on track to deliver our initial target of 10% overhead enrollment reduction, we'll aim to do more. We have identified and will appoint a Senior Group President to the role of Global Officer Productivity and Organization transformation to lead the next round of designed based productivity improvements in a full time capacity. This role will report directly to Bob McDonald and will be supported by a productivity council of senior managers.","As we embrace this cost savings work, we must and will keep our eye on the overriding objectives of shareholder value creation, with growth being an important part of this. At the end of last fiscal year our core operating margin was nearly 19%, which compares to simple competitive peer average of 15.9%.","We start with a higher operating margin in 12 out of the 15 companies we benchmarked. This includes SCA, Kimberly Clark, Energizer, Church & Dwight, Unilever, Henkel, Clorox, Beyersdorf, L'Oreal, Estee Lauder, Avon and Unicharm. Only three companies are higher; Colgate, Reckitt and Johnson & Johnson, driven in large part by the structure and business model of the categories they compete in.","This means that we are more effectively leveraged to growth than most of our competitors and that there is significant value creation to be delivered through growth. In our endeavor to cut costs we will not compromise our growth prospectus or capabilities. Ultimately the answer to the right amount of cost savings doesn't lie in the math. It lies in a holistic evaluation of value creation potential.","There are opportunities to add cost, take Tide PODS for example, which improves the value of our offerings, extend our competitive advantages, build the business and create significant value and there are clear opportunities to reduce costs. We're making strong progress against our $10 billion plan and we'll not stop there, but will not compromise growth in the process. Our endeavor and our job is to get this balance right. We'll go into more detail on each of the strategic focus areas I have just described at our Analyst Day in November.","Now, I'll turn to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2013 and the October-December quarter. There are two new developments that we're building into our guidance for the balance of the year. First, given the significant earnings and cash over delivery in the July September quarter and given slowing market growth rates especially in southern Europe and several large developing markets, we are leaning forward on our equity building marketing investments to support our back half innovations. This will temper earnings per share growth in the second half, which should help to improve market share momentum heading into next fiscal year.","The second development is the explosion of the Nippon Shokubai factory in Himeji, Japan. Nippon Shokubai, is one of our suppliers of absorbent gelling material or AGM, which is used in diapers. There is still a high level of uncertainty as to when Nippon Shokubai's full AGM production will be restored. At this point we are expecting minimal supply disruption to consumers. We will incur added supplier chain costs in the back half of the fiscal year though as we manage the flow of materials and finished products and we have accounted for these costs within our guidance range.","Moving to the details we are maintaining organic sales growth guidance in the range of 2% to 4% for the fiscal year. This is comprised of volume growth of 1% to 3%, pricing contribution of about 2% and negative mix of around 1%. We now expect foreign exchange will be a top line headwind of about 2% to 3%, based on mid-October spot rates. This brings our all-in sales look to essentially flat to up 1% versus the prior year. We are also maintaining our core earnings per share a guidance range of $3.80 to $4. Within our fiscal 2013 guidance we expect approximately $0.04 to $0.05 benefit from a combination of lower interest expense and higher non-operating income from minor brand divestitures. These benefits will be offset by a $0.04 to $0.05 headwind from a higher effective tax rate on core earnings.","There are couple of significant items included within this guidance, which we've mentioned previously. Our guidance includes a $0.06 per share negative impact from pension and employee benefit plans as a result of revised assumptions for the discount rate used to value plan liabilities and projected returns on plan assets. These costs are relatively equal across the quarters. We've also included about a $0.06 per share impact from the combination of import restrictions in Argentina and the carry-over impact from mandated price reductions in Venezuela.","Combined the headwinds from pension and benefit plans and specific market impacts are reducing our core earnings per share growth rate by about 3 percentage points. Adjusting for these our core earnings per share growth rate would be in the range of 2% to 7% for the fiscal year. To aid transparency and enable more informed decision making, we also wanted to call out some of the potential risks that are not included in our guidance.","Our forecast is based on mid-October foreign exchange spot rates, potential currency risks that include significant dollar strengthening and a largest devaluation of Venezuelan Bolivar. The guidance assumes current market growth rates continue for the balance of the fiscal year. A significant further deceleration for example a deepening of the European financial issues or as a result of the fiscal cliff in the United States will put additional downward pressure on marketed growth rates and our outlook.","Last we're also assuming our guidance that key provisions of the U.S. tax code, which require regular extension including the R&D tax credit and [sub-part F] look through rules are in fact extended. Finalizing the fiscal year outlook in an all-in basis, we have increased earnings per share estimates by $0.17 to $3.78 to $4.02. The increase is due to the estimated non-core holding gain resulting from our purchase of the balance of our Baby Care and Feminine Care joint venture in Iberia, which we completed earlier this week.","The amount of the one-time gain is an estimate and may still change as we complete our evaluation of the proper purchase accounting. The transaction is expected to be roughly neutral to core earnings per share results this fiscal year as the ongoing benefits from full ownership of the business will be offset by one-time transitional costs.","Our all-in earnings per share guidance range also includes non-core restructuring investments of $0.15 top $0.19 per share consistent with our prior outlook. As I mentioned we continue to expect free cash flow productivity of about 90% from net earnings for the year. This includes capital spending of about 5.5% of sales. The first priority for the use of free cash flow is the dividend. We expect to continue our 122-year track record of dividend payments and our 56-year track record of dividend increases. The exact amount of the increase is subject to Board approval and will be determined by the Board during the April 2013 Board meeting.","In the October to December quarter we are estimating organic sales growth in the range of 1% to 3%, sequentially better than the zero to 2% guidance for the July-September period. Within this we expect pricing will contribute two points to sales growth. Foreign exchange is excepted to reduce sales by 2%, which leads to all-in sales in the range of down one to up one versus year ago.","On the bottom line we expect December core earnings per share in the range of $1.07 to $1.13 or down 2% to up 4% compared to prior year core earnings per share of $1.09. The guidance range reflects the impact of slower market growth and stronger marketing plans. The high end of this range includes the potential gain from a minor brand divestiture. The time is this transaction is still uncertain and the higher part of the range is less likely if the deal isn't completed in the quarter.","As you think about comparisons recall the December quarter base period includes $0.04 per share gain from the divestiture of the peer business. On an all-in basis we estimate earnings per share in the range of $1.18 to $1.25. This includes non-core restructuring charges in the range of $0.05 to $0.06 per share and the $0.17 share non-core gain I described earlier.","In summary our first quarter results were on track with our plan on the top line and ahead of plan on operating profit earnings per share in cash. This puts us solidly on track to deliver our commitments for this fiscal year without creating flexibility to further strengthen our plans for the core business in the second half and offset the cost of managing Baby Care supply.","We remain confident that our focus on maintaining momentum in developing markets, strengthening our core developed market business, building the strong innovation pipeline and aggressively driving cost savings and productivity improvement should generate over time the kind of earnings progress that will put us among the best in our industry.","This combined with our strong cash flow and track record of capital returns to shareholders should enable us to generate superior levels of shareholder return in both the near and long-term. We'll be going into more depth in each of these areas at our Analyst Meeting here in Cincinnati on November 15th. If you aren't able to travel to Cincinnati for the meeting, we hope you listen to the management presentation via the internet webcast.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Bob, Teri and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mr. Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank North America. Please proceed.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank North America","Hi, guys good morning.","Jon Moeller","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank North America","Hey, can you just talk about what the U.S. volume in sales growth was organically in the quarter and then maybe some color between the delta of the sort of 45% of the global business for market share was flat or up and the 60% in the U.S., which is obviously [both great] incremental progress, why was there such a big delta between the global and the U.S. business?","","Jon Moeller","","So, we had modest growth in organic sales in the U.S., volume is still down slightly versus year ago, but importantly an accelerating trend as we went through the quarter. In terms of the difference between 60% - businesses representing 60% of sales growing share in the U.S. and the 45% globally, a big portion of that is, there are two drivers of that. One is China, where while we continue to grow at a very attractive rate 7% in the quarter, for the quarter we were below market level growth rate of about 11%. And as you know China is our second largest business in terms of both sales and profit. We have strong plans in China going forward, we expect to get it back to share growth in the second half, but that's the predominant driver of the math.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Bob McDonald","Good morning, Dara.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","I know category growth slowed a bit in the quarter around the world, but on the other hand you had an Olympic boost and the organic sales growth did decelerate sequentially despite the easier comp and the number of the adjustments that you made. So, I guess why don't we see more progress on organic sales growth at this point and what drives your confidence that you'll see an improvement in the remainder of the year and this marketing will pay off just given the difficult consumer environment out there.","","Jon Moeller","","As I mentioned in our remarks our full intervention program in developed markets won't be fully deployed in market until January. As that happens based on the results that we have seen with the first part of that deployment, which have been positive as I talked we're - that's one of the reasons we gained confidence, both that is right to invest in those plants and that they will result in accelerated top line progress. The other thing I hope you picked up as we talked about innovation is that we have a very strong second half innovation program and obviously I can only talk about innovations that we have already announced to the trade. There are number of things that we are not yet talking about. But we should - that's why we should expect the business to accelerate. Bob, I don't know if you have any further thoughts on that.","Bob McDonald","I think, I would just say Dara as Jon said that we're in the early innings of our program that our 40-20 plan is on track, its gaining momentum in developing markets and strengthening the core developed markets. We are in the early innings of our innovation program. As Jon says it strengthens after January and we are also in the early innings of our productivity program. So what you should expect to see is continued progress. We are on track and continued progress is ahead.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JP Morgan.","John Faucher - JP Morgan Chase","Yes, thanks. Just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the Beauty category in terms of looking at Hair Care in particular, where the market share trends continue to be very, very weak. Can you talk a little bit about that from a regional basis in terms of where you think the biggest opportunities are?","And then Jon you talked a lot about the pipeline. Is this about new products or this about repositioning that's really going to change the underlying trend in Beauty, which has been disappointing for quite some time now?","Bob McDonald","Relative to Hair Care, we're seeing signs of progress. In the U.S. Pantene share has begun to stabilize and our most recent product launches are performing well. North America remains a high priority for Hair Care. We're investing behind our core brands and we have a full portfolio of innovation this fiscal particularly strengthening throughout the year.","In July we launched Pantene Beautiful Lengths, Pantene Daily Moisture Renewal, Head & Shoulders Damage Rescue, Head & Shoulders Deep Clean and in January we are following this with our recently announced launch of Pantene Expert Collection, which includes two super premium lines AgeDefy and Advanced plus Keratin Repair priced 200% to 250% above the base Pantene line.","We are also introducing the new mid-tier Hair Care line priced at 50 to 75 index to the base Pantene shampoos and conditioners. So we are excited about the Hair Care business. We are making progress over time, but as I said earlier it's the early innings and we should greater progress over time.","Jon Moeller","I think to your question John of this repositioning our current products or new products, we are really making a big intervention in the portfolio for the first time in a long time. So both, if you think about Hair Care, Pantene Super Premium items as well as the launch of a mid-tier line up to us. Illumina, which I mentioned in the Salon business is a completely new products that's transforming the way that hairdressers think about color and protecting it. Then if you think about our Skin Care portfolio obviously the new mid-tier lineup is a completely new item in our portfolio. So we are going to make some pretty significant progress in filling what have been some perennial holes and I think that will stand us in much better stead.","Bob McDonald","And each one of these products John is backed by a new technology which is superior to what's currently available and that's important because that's what delivers the superior benefit for the consumer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS","Good morning everyone.","Bob McDonald","Hi, Nick.","Nik Modi - UBS","The quick question from me is just on the U.S. side. I guess you know the shares have really improved quite dramatically. I am assuming that's more levels of spending. So just wanted to get an understanding of you know the ramp there. I mean, should we be expecting a ramp in spending over the next several quarters as you get to kind of a more normalized level that you are comfortable with or do you feel like you are at good levels already?","","Jon Moeller","","Well, there are two components as you recall when we discussed this initially. One is more competitive pricing, which is one element of what's driving better plans and that's pretty much done. We talked about $400 million of price rollbacks out of the $3.6 billion in our last call. That's still the figure we are looking at. Of course this is something we'll continue to look at in a weekly or monthly basis, but that's largely in-market. Then marketing spending as I mentioned will increase as we bring our innovation pipeline into the - fully into the market starting in January.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America. Please proceed.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Hey thanks. Guys, you have been using I guess some tempering language around the balancing of cost savings going forward with the ability to grow and I was just wondering the outperformance you see near-term on cost savings. Is that essentially a pull forward relative to the $10 billion. Like is the $10 billion pie potentially getting bigger and then is the 150 basis points of savings you saw this quarter a reasonable run rate to think about going forward? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","","So, Chris we have to increase, if you go back to your - the original $10 billion that we laid out, you'll probably remember that what was $8 billion of the cost reductions and $2 billion of leverage. And that assumed the 5% growth rate on the top line which we haven't delivered, in the last year in our forecast and delivered this year, so we do have to increase the amount of absolute reductions that we're targeting to make. And we'll do that and we won't stop there either. And Bob can talk more about that in a second.","In terms of the level of savings that we should see going forward, I think a 150 basis points is - if this will be lumpy so I wouldn't model that out quarter by quarter but it's in the range in terms of the level of magnitude you should see.","Bob McDonald","And we talked about our plan, Chris, you recall we talked about the 40-20-10 focus we talked about boosting innovation and we talked about the importance of productivity. In innovation we've taken steps to improve our discontinuous innovation, we've discussed those in the past, and we're continuing to improve our innovation as reflected in the program that Jon described which is getting strong throughout the year.","In terms of productivity, we're committed to developing a culture of productivity in our company, equal to our culture of innovation and that's the establishment of the productivity council we talked about. The senior officer for organization transformation, productivity. We see this is as an ongoing part of our culture, not as an episodic event, and as a result we want to drive it in the culture and continue it on an ongoing basis.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicolson, of City. Please proceed.","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","My question is kind of a follow-up I think on all those points and Jon, I think your comments on the call about you benchmarking your operating margin against your peers and how your operating margin is already very good? To phrase the question again, about your long-term targeted growth rate of potentially being double digit on the earnings front. And I guess, I want to just follow up on that and ask why that is - most of your peers are not putting up double digit earnings growth, and I think this is going to bring Procter back into sort of a boom and bust cycle of growth?","And given everything out there from a competitive perspective, is it not better to rein in that long term growth rate and just go for consistent earnings growth year after year. Because it just seems like the gap between 4% market growth, a little bit of market share expansion a little bit of share buyback. Just seems like double digit earnings growth, is a carrot that you're just not going to get to on a sustainable basis. So any thoughts I would appreciate?","Jon Moeller","Well, thank Wendy. First, we continue to keep our long-term guidance range anchored in high singles to low doubles. High singles are in there for a reason. And you've hit on some of the key points. I think there is a big driver though in terms of productivity, that's the $2 billion of savings a year is worth 11 in earnings per share by itself. But you're absolutely right, that we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves and we shouldn't stretch too far. Internally, we talk about balance, balance of growth and developed and developing markets balance of top and bottom line and balance of short and long-term. And we will keep that balance in mind as we formulize a guidance going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein. Please proceed.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Hey guys. So we're obviously very happy to see that you've found a religion in cost-cutting and you used to be sound like the other tough thing to do in - almost reining cost cutting, which is good news. And you're staying up organizationally to do this.","As you think about it going forward and we're excited to hear again about, sounds like an increase in cost cutting going forward, as you think about this going forward, how do you position yourself in the context of your peers were also increasing their restructuring spending, almost in a tit for tat manner. And what does it mean - what does it mean to the organization and I say that in the context of one of the things you resisted about doing a big cost cutting, would that be disruptive to your organization. Can you revisit that statement from a few years ago and talk how it was impacting our relation now and more broadly you think the industry again willing competitors are doing the same thing?","Bob McDonald","Ali. Yeah, this is Bob. I think that we've discussed the factors that impacted our past results what I want to focus on is the feature, we're to creating the culture of productivity in our company and the way we're going to do it, exactly as we described in our comment and since - it's to put together a guiding coalition of top leaders in this company. As we do this, we're going to be looking for opportunities to find efficiency within the organization. One of the things we know from organization survey, is that the organization is asking for this. This isn't something that will be disruptive, in fact this should be enabling to higher growth rates because of the way that we currently operate, where employees are telling us that that they could use better efficiency.","So we're going to be working hard on this and the intention is to create a culture of productivity that to outlast any of us in the current leadership or the organization.","Jon Moeller","But I think also Ali, you've raised a very valid point, which I was trying to get to in my prepared remarks as well, back to balance. And we are cognizant of the need to keep that balance and that was today, in front of us as we make these choices.","Bob McDonald","I mean we're cognizant of this balance idea when we put together the plan, the 40-20-10 plan, it's about balancing developed and developing most of the 40-yearend developed, the 10 are all developing, it's about innovation and it's about innovation and productivity and those two are not contradictory and we expect every Procter & Gamble leader to be able to lead with balance and do both simultaneously.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer","Thanks, good morning. First just want to start up with a housekeeping question, I think [though] you mentioned you're seeing a little bit of slow down overall in your markets globally and on the last call you you're looking for about 4% to 5% market growth, this year, so I would assume you're more comfortable to low end of that range at this point going forward, and then secondly in terms of mix, it was flat this quarter, it has been a drag, a little bit. Could you break down what that look like versus, and in terms of product versus geographic mix and might that be mutual for the full year. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So I think you're right Joe, to be thinking about the lower end of the range in terms of market growth rates. And in terms of the mix component, it's really kind of equally split between product and geographic. I would expect actually the geographic component of mix to increase as a negative going forward simply because we expect our growth rates in developing markets to accelerate as I mentioned earlier. And product really is anybody's guess that's all dependent on what consumers choose to buy, so we'll have to see if you look at the aggregate it would probably be a drag as opposed to even in the going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research","Hi, good morning, everyone, I actually have a follow-up on the developing and emerging markets. Yesterday, Kimberly reported 45% volume growth in China diapers and mid teens growth in Brazil and Russia. This morning also, Unilever reported 12% organic (Inaudible) growth in emerging markets. So to what extent - what you guys are doing - refocusing the company somehow is taking resources out of developing on emerging markets and that's why you decelerated to 7% and we should see a ramp up as you put the plans in place, or as opposed to I guess, just real market deceleration which other companies don't seem to have seen as much.","Bob McDonald","I think it's important Javier again to go back to the plan, the 40-20-10 plan focuses on the top ten developing markets and we as a company have a smaller footprint in developing markets than our competitors but only 38% of our business in developing markets, our competitors are 40% and 60%. And as a result, they get a greater degree of growth in developing markets than we do. That's why Jon talked about [building] out 20 new category country combinations, that's why we're building roughly 15 plants in developing markets since we need to increase our footprint in developing markets.","Going forward it's one of our strategic priorities as Jon mentioned. So, no we're not taking resources away from it at all. In fact we're focusing on it, and if you look across the BRIC markets for example, organic sales rates in the last quarter, China was 7%, Russia was 8%, India was 25%, Brazil was 28%. So there's very strong levels of growth. And as I mentioned, the acceleration that we're expecting is really behind innovation based plans and category, expansion. So I expect it will occur.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Zeke Kramer - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, it's actually, Zeke Kramer filling in for Connie. Given that P&G's 4 points below market growth in China, we wanted to get a sense of where you're seeing weakness?","And then I was also wondering if you could give us an update on the Teva joint venture and what contribution it has made? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Thank you, Zeke. Well, our China organic sales grew high single digits in the quarter. And grew double digits last fiscal year. We've recently experienced some share softness, driven mainly by skin care where we've had some portfolio gaps, and Oral Care where we've had some price gaps. We've got a strong portfolio of innovation, launching this fiscal year, and we're confident that the combination of that innovation and intervention plans that we've already made are going to return us to market share growth in China.","Give us just a second to comment on Teva. I mentioned in my remarks the expansion of the Vicks franchise into Russia and Poland, that's emblematic of the kind of activity that we see ahead of us. We're now at about a year in and we're very excited about what we see. We've just had a strategy review with our personal healthcare business last week. And there is a lot of very promising activity building on the combined strengths of both Procter & Gamble and Teva that should allow us to dramatically accelerate our rate of global expansion. And our rate of category expansion even here in the U.S.","Bob McDonald","And our healthcare business is strategically important to us, as we've said before we have the largest and most profitable household care business, the largest in most profitable beauty care business. And one of the largest and most profitable healthcare businesses but given the demographics of the world, we think this is a key growth engine for the company now and into the future, and we see Teva as a key enabler.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust. Please proceed.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust","Good morning. Just wanted to dabble a bit more into the upside that you've reinvesting in the back half of the year. Can you give us an idea in terms of marketing, is that more tree promotions, is that more advertising will that - and that'd be more developing markets or developed markets. Thanks.","Bob McDonald","As Jon indicated, in his remarks Bill, that this is behind the innovations we're bringing to market and as a result of that it will be more marketing spending like advertising, [trial] generation, awareness generation, not to trade spending. And it will go with the innovation so it will be split relatively on a proportional basis between developing and developed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good morning, I guess I want to talk a little bit about Western Europe and yesterday we heard about, Kimberly Clark, exiting the diaper business out there, obviously they couldn't cover their cost of capital so I guess I want to delve in a little bit about that region and the discipline that maybe you guys have in terms of looking at more business there that you may have similar situations, and really kind of reallocate those resources to the emerging markets as you've talked about with your long-term growth plan.","I know you've done this before consumer tissue is one business that you got out of a few years ago, but I guess if you could provide a little bit a color that would be appreciated. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Sure, I'll just say a couple of things and then turn it over to Bob, frankly this is a story that [frames] scale pretty well. Kimberly has about a 10% market share in Europe and has difficulty understandably earning cost of capital returns. We have about a 50% share in the baby care business and as a result have much more attractive structural economics. We have fairly strong share positions across the categories that we operate in Europe, and so benefit from a scale our margins are in the mid-teens and offer us many attractive opportunities. So I wouldn't see a significant redeployment of resources from Europe to other markets.","Bob McDonald","Yeah, I think Jon said it well. Europe is an important market for us. We see the contraction there as an opportunity, and as john said we're deploying against that opportunity but also we're working in Europe just as we are in other parts of the world on improving our productivity while we improve our innovation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research. Please proceed.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research","Hi. Good morning. I've got a question - a follow-up on, your market growth assumption, so you're announcing global - your markets are growing about 4%, could you break that down into how fast your markets are growing in the U.S., Europe and emerging regions? And as you do that tell us how fast the markets are growing in volume and pricing terms?","And then just one other - which is that are you losing share in emerging markets and countries other than China, or is it just China? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","So, in terms of regionalization of market growth, think of that as about 9% growth in aggregate, on a market level in developing markets. 1 to 2 points, probably closer to 1 in the developed world. Within that 1 Europe would be negative, the U.S. would be positive. And then in terms of market share broadly, we're growing at rates like 25% in India and 28% in Brazil. Those are share gaining growth rates. And so broadly we continue to - because China is so big, in aggregate we did a lose a little bit of share in developing markets. But that's really the first quarter out of the last 11 that that's happened, we know why it's happened and as Bob said we've got plans to address it. We're very comfortable with our forecast of growing share as we growth through the rest of the year.","Bob McDonald","Remember in China, we're about 3.5 - 4 times the size of our next largest competitor.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Lachky of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Joe Lachky - Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks I'm just filling in for Tim Conder this morning, but we're talking a little bit earlier you were talking on beauty. The beauty category and beauty segment lagging as for as organic growth and you talked lot about the Hair Care and Pantene but I wanted to focus my question more so on the Skin Care, specifically your strategy in Olay and particularly in developed markets? It seems like you're stretching your product portfolio vertically maybe going up against some Prestige manufacturers and it seems maybe you're missing out on some mid-tier innovation in Skin Care. So I was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit?","Jon Moeller","Thank you, Joe for the question. Specifically in the announcement we announced that we're going to entering the mid-tier segment of skin care in North America in the second half of the year with a launch of an Olay item and Olay Boutique. So we see that opportunities as well and we're going after it. That's it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen of William Blair. Please proceed.","","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Good morning.","Bob McDonald","Good morning.","Jon Andersen - William Blair","You said -- a question on some of the comments around the [share] that you are achieving starting to achieve an emerging markets. I thought, Jon your comment was interesting that after tax profitability is up, I think 35% year-over-year in emerging markets. Do you see fiscal '13 as an inflexion point with respect to that that, the scale that you're building on local production that you bringing online is kind of positioning for acceleration on that front that would be helpful? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","The first one \u2013 a housekeeping clarification, the 35% of profit growth that I referred was in our top 10 developing markets, but those are the most important and the biggest so it's meaningful. And I do think Jon this is an inflexion point. I don't view it as a stair step but a true inflexion point on which we continued to build profitability going forward.","We're at a point now in many of these markets where local production is justified and we're building factories and as those come online and as we get both the benefits of our overall productivity program and the benefit of increased scale in developing markets things like media purchasing et cetera. We should see a continued slope on that line.","Bob McDonald","And this is why Jon continued entry into more category country combination is important. Also I you know I said earlier that we were disadvantage by having a lower percent of our business in developing markets vis-\u00e0-vis our competition. By having said that our lower percentage of 38% still leads to a $32 billion business, which is larger in aggregate than some of our competitive companies and so it's a largest developing market business in aggregate and that's what leads to the scale advantage that John just described.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please proceed.","","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Yeah, thanks and good morning. Just a housekeeping first, are share repurchases higher than anticipated I guess in the quarter, is there a change, or is there any sort of difference versus the expectations you laid out previously on that. And then back on beauty I was just curious you think about balancing increased SKUs in existing brands with the development of new brands in a potentially acquisition.","Jon Moeller","So first on share repurchase, we did frontload our share repurchase program and that was largely a reflection on what where we started the quarter relative to stock price. We haven't at this point changed any guidance relative to the $4 billion. We expect to repurchase, it's obviously something we continue to revisit. And our principles are very clear in returning excess cash to shareholders so if cash comes in strong well we'll look at our options in that regard.","Bob McDonald","You've a good point, Mark on the incremental SKUs. We worked very hard as part of our innovation development to make sure that we introduce SKUs that will be successful, they're consumer relevant and that the consumers will buy superior performing products at a good value. And so we also worked very hard with retailers to make sure they have an efficient assortment of products on their shelf that they don't have extraneous SKUs they don't need the high criteria they have or alternatively that they aren't -- they don't support launches of competitive brands, which don't succeed because often times you have a lot of companies bringing out SKUs that don't succeed and later need to be cleaned up. And we work hard not to be one of those companies and we work hard with retailers to make sure they get the highest return on investment in their space.","Jon Moeller","As relates to acquisition, we continue to view that as much a lower priority than organic growth just given the opportunities we have in front of us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser of Caris. Please proceed.","","Linda Bolton Weiser - Caris","Hi. I was wondering on the topic of disruptive innovation if you could give a timeframe for when we might expect to see that? I'm assuming not enough like 13 and even though you don't want to tell us about it have you identified internally what it will be? Thanks a lot.","Bob McDonald","Linda, I would offer going to a store today and look at Tide PODS. I think that's relatively I think that is disruptive. It's growing the Tide business strongly as Jon said and our laundry business as well. And it's leading to about $0.5 billion in incremental sales or in sales and it's only a one country on one brand, so we still have a long way to go to rule it out.","Relative to the other disruptive as you've called them disruptive. We call them discontinuous items we're developing, we said you'll see things over within a year over the year and we're obviously, I'm not going to tell you what they are right now because then our competitors would know as well.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy of CLSA. Please proceed.","","Caroline Levy - CLSA","Thank you, good morning everybody and my question is on China. Couple of things you -- I believe you'd moved your Beauty headquarters to I think Singapore. So just to understand what differences you expect to see in the Beauty business over there and globally and then just so the - across in the other areas as a result of doing that?","The second thing is I don't think you mentioned diapers as a place you'd lost share in China. But based on what Kimberly said, it sounds like you are losing share there so could you address the diaper business in China?","Bob McDonald","First on Beauty, when we say, when we call our category beauty or talking about Skin Care antiperspirant deodorant and bar soap or body wash, it is true that we have moved the headquarters for that business. We're talking now less than 40 people to Asia. And the reason for that is that that's where the business is greatest, that's where the competition is toughest and that's where many of the trends are being set. So that's the reason we did that and then on diapers remember we're starting from a much larger position than Kimberly Clark is at today. We actually grew the Pampers business 20% in China over the quarter, so we're very happy with how that business is progressing.","Operator","Ladies and gentleman that concludes today's conference.

Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business and has posted on its website, www.PG.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","The quarter we just completed was a strong one from both a cash flow and underlying earnings perspective. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was very strong at 101%. Constant currency core earnings per share increased double digits, with meaningful triple-digit basis point improvements in both gross and operating margins on both a constant currency and all-in basis. All-in GAAP earnings per share were up 32%.","Organic sales were down a point, reflecting deliberate choices to exit some structurally unprofitable business lines, volatile market conditions, and the early stage we are at in our strengthening and improvement plans on large categories and markets. We're bringing innovations to market and are making investments in value equations, sampling and in trial of our products and brands, as well as in selling coverage. We expect organic top line growth to resume in Q2, with further strengthening in the back half.","We do continue to operate in a challenging and volatile macro environment. Market growth rates on both a volume and value basis are decelerating, due mainly to slower growth in developing markets. We entered the year expecting the market to grow close to 4% globally. We now expect 3%. There are more flashpoints across the globe than at any time in recent memory. Currencies are weakening pretty much across the board, a $300 million after-tax impact since the start of the fiscal year and $600 million after-tax versus year ago. This, as you know, comes on top of a $1.5 billion impact last fiscal year and a $1.1 billion impact the year before.","P&G has leading positions in some of the toughest markets. Versus the next multinational competitor, our business is over three times larger in Russia and the Ukraine. In Japan, where devaluations had a significant impact, the business is six times larger than the next largest non-Japanese competitor. We're almost three times larger in China, where the market has recently slowed. In the Middle East, which has been heavily impacted by political instability, war, crashing oil prices, our business is two times larger than the next multinational competitor. These tough markets represent over $14 billion in sales or roughly 20% of the company, so they're not trivial.","The relative strength of the dollar has made it tougher for us than our euro and yen functional currency competitors. We're facing, for example, a 40% devaluation in Russia, while our euro functional competitors are facing half of that. Each of these items are realities, not excuses, and many of these dynamics will continue.","Against this backdrop, we're staying focused on big opportunities in our control, executing what is the largest transformation in our company's history, step-changing productivity, transforming our supply chain, focusing our portfolio, and strengthening category business model and innovation plans. This transformation strategy is ultimately a growth strategy.","We're dramatically improving productivity, with a lot of upside still ahead. In February 2012, we announced that we would reduce non-manufacturing overhead by 10% over five years. As of September 30, we've reduced these roles by 23%, more than double the original target, and are on track to meet a revised target of 25% to 30% by the end of fiscal 2017.","Our original cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We expect to deliver over $7 billion by the end of this year, 15% above our initial target. We've reduced manufacturing enrollment by 15% over the last three years. This includes new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same-site basis, manufacturing enrollment is down nearly 20%. As with overhead, we're targeting a 25% to 30% cumulative reduction by the end of fiscal 2017.","We are strengthening marketing, greater reach, higher frequency, greater effectiveness, at less overall cost. Last year we reduced the number of agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by $300 million. We're aiming for an additional $200 million of agency-related savings this year. These are non-working savings that enable us to invest in working media and sampling dollars.","We're also driving balance sheet productivity. Inventory days are down year on year. Payables days are up. The moves we made here have enabled us to extend our long track record of strong adjusted free cash flow productivity, 102% last fiscal year, 101% last quarter, despite the investments we're making in our supply chain.","We continue to maintain our position as one of the strongest cash generators among competitive peers and comparable mega-cap companies. We're also among the top companies in returning cash to shareholders. In fiscal 2015 we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year and returned $11.9 billion in cash to shareholders, 105% of adjusted net earnings. Over the past five years we've returned $60 billion to shareholders and intend to pay dividends, retire shares, and repurchase shares worth up to $70 billion over just the next four years.","We're transforming our supply chain to lower cost, reduce inventory, improve customer service levels, and increase product quality and process reliability. We're re-siting manufacturing capacity closer to major consumer populations and our new distribution hubs. We're shutting down older, more remote single-category production sites and building new multi-category facilities. We continue to localize manufacturing and sourcing, reducing costs and currency exposure. We're upgrading, automating, and standardizing our operations, improving manufacturing process reliability and asset utilization rates.","As you know, we are transforming our portfolio. We're centered 10 category-based business units where P&G has leading market positions, strong brands, and consumer-meaningful product technologies. These 10 categories have been growing faster with higher margins than the balance of the company. These are categories with clear consumer jobs to be done, where product functionality and efficacy matters. They are products that consumers purchase in our channels and use on a daily basis. We will be a company of superior brands and products in these 10 product categories.","Within these core businesses, we're also focusing our portfolios to maximize value creation. We're making smart choices for short, mid, and long-term value creation or going-bad business, even when these choices create short-term top line pressure. In the Mexico tissue business, for example, we're shifting our focus from low-tier conventional tissue products to premium-tier differentiated products. This will reduce sales by nearly $75 million, over 1% of global category sales, but profit will increase by more than $30 million.","We've made similar choices in Fabric Care. We are deprioritizing less profitable non-strategic brands and product lines and low-price offerings to improve the profitability of the business at a trade-off of about a point of sales growth in the category. We've also accepted trade-off of top line for value creation at the market level. In India, for example, we've accepted a reduction in top line growth from mid-teens to high singles, improving local profit margins more than 700 basis points last year. We'll continue to grow, but now the growth will be worth something.","We've been strengthening business unit strategies, business models, and product innovation, but in particular priority against the four largest categories, Baby Care, Fabric Care, Hair Care and Grooming, and the two largest markets, the U.S. and China. We're focusing our Laundry business on consumer preferred brands and product innovations like our premium performance and premium priced unit-dosed detergents, our market-leading and market-expanding scent bead fabric enhancers. And we're launching better performing and more profitable new compact liquid detergents in Russia, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, and China.","The Fabric Care results in the U.S. demonstrate what is possible when we get the strategy balanced and the innovation program focused on what matters most to consumers, superior value and best-in-class performance at a modest price premium. The U.S. laundry category is growing again, up three points on a value basis across all outlets over the last six-month period. Within this, P&G share is growing. U.S. laundry detergent value share was up more than a point last fiscal year and grew again this quarter. Fabric enhancer share is up nearly a point over the same period.","In U.S. Baby Care, strong innovation, consumer communication, trial programs, and a robust online presence have led to strong growth. P&G value share of U.S. diapers was up more than 1.5 points last fiscal year and was up 0.5 point again this quarter. We just launched our latest Pampers premium tier innovation, and we expect it to help us sustain this strong momentum.","Baby Care results have been soft in other markets. To address this, we've accelerated premium innovations on both taped and pull-on diapers to restore our competitiveness at the top end of the market. We're strengthening our selling resources and programs for baby stores, and we're improving our point-of-market entry programs to deliver higher awareness and trial of Pampers among new moms.","The largest male and female grooming brands, Gillette's Fusion and Venus, have proven to be and will continue to be huge platforms for our blade and razor innovation. We've continued the growth of Fusion with the big, obvious, and preferred FlexBall innovation that launched in the U.S. last year. We began rolling out the FlexBall technology in parts of Europe and Asia at the beginning of this calendar year. In less than 18 months, we've put 25 million Fusion FlexBall razors into the hands of men around the world, and we've recently launched into markets in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe.","We've also extended the FlexBall technology to Venus, the best-selling women's razor in the world, with the Venus Swirl innovation. We're continuing to innovate at the top end of the market to extend the product performance advantage we already enjoy over all competitors. Our new cartridge upgrade will launch in just a few months.","We're supporting a broader range of our product ladder, from our best product, Fusion FlexBall, to MACH3 systems, to premium-priced and superior performance disposables with strong consumer value communication. We're innovating in store, helping retailers move out of the lock boxes on the shelves and at checkout with the use of hard tags. Hard tags make Gillette much easier to shop. They take up less space on shelves so more product can be put on a peg, reducing out-of-stocks and improving sales closure rates, and they're very effective at reducing shrink. We've already made the change in several hundred stores with excellent results, and we'll be rolling out hard tags as fast as we can in the year ahead.","We're also innovating online. With more men purchasing their blades and razors through e-commerce, it's critical that Gillette establishes itself as the online leader. Gillette's online Shave Club launched in June and is off to a very good start, with e-commerce share of blades and razors up four points since launch. We're building partnerships with e-tailers and retailers. We're offering our shoppers subscription tie-ins for the Gillette Shave Club. Gillette is now consistently number one in paid search and has gone from number 50 to number two in organic shave club search. Importantly, Gillette's product is significantly consumer preferred over any and all shave club competition, winning on closeness, smoothness, comfort, and 18 other attributes tested, including importantly, overall better shaves.","We have a strong innovation plan coming to market in China to capture more of the fast-growing premium tier segment. We're leveraging premium Baby Care innovations in both the taped and pull-on segments. We're launching compact Ariel liquid detergents that consumers prefer over competition, and we have new upgrades coming soon on Tide.","We've made meaningful product and packaging improvements in Hair Care that launched last quarter on both Head & Shoulders and Pantene. And we're investing to improve the capabilities of our go-to-market operations, strengthening our relationships and presence with key e-commerce and specialty retailers, the fastest-growing segments of the Chinese retail market.","We're increasing our investment in consumer awareness, point-of-market entry sampling, and trial across product categories. These moves take time to fully implement, but we're confident they will result in stronger growth over time, just as they've done in U.S. Baby Care and the Fabric Care business.","So it continues to be a challenging environment. Against this backdrop, we continue to improve productivity, to transform our supply chain, to focus our portfolios, and to invest in superior consumer preferred brands and products. Cash flow is very strong as are underlying economics. We're investing in the future and are confident we'll return to positive organic top line growth next quarter. While it's not yet complete and it's only one month and while we face our toughest comp in December, we're off to a good start, with our October organic sales growth at 3% so far.","With that, let me get into the details of the quarter we just completed and the fiscal year outlook; two housekeeping items before I begin. First, the organic sales and core earnings results we're reporting today are based on our 10 core product categories. The results of the Beauty and Batteries businesses that we're in the process of exiting are reported as discontinued operations. In September we provided an informational 8-K presenting historical results on this same basis. Second, starting this period we are no longer consolidating the results of our Venezuelan subsidiaries into our reported numbers.","As I mentioned previously, organic sales were down 1% for the quarter versus the prior year. China and Brazil were large drivers of the sales decline, accounting for one point of total company sales growth headwind. We estimate that category and SKU cleanup efforts drove up to another point of sales decline. All-in sales were down 12%, including a nine point headwind from foreign exchange and two points from the Venezuela deconsolidation and other minor brand divestitures.","Core gross margin and core operating margin both improved on both an all-in and ex-currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 250 basis points versus the prior year. Excluding foreign exchange, core gross margin was up 310 basis points. Core operating margin was up 270 points versus the prior year behind 260 basis points of productivity savings. On a constant currency basis, core operating margin was up 320 basis points.","The core effective tax rate was 24%, up 1.5 points versus the prior year, a $0.02 per share drag on core earnings per share.","Core earnings per share were $0.98, down 1% versus the prior quarter. This includes a 13 percentage point foreign exchange headwind, nearly $400 million after tax. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share grew 12%. On an all-in GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.91 for the quarter, up 32% versus the prior year.","We generated $3 billion in free cash flow, yielding 101% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of $1.9 billion in dividend and $0.5 billion in share repurchase.","Moving to guidance, as we said last quarter, we expect fiscal 2016 to be a year, given market volatility, FX headwinds, and pricing, of modest top line growth, solid core operating income growth, robust constant currency core earnings per share growth, and strong 90% to 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity. We're maintaining our outlook for organic sales growth of in line to up low single digits versus fiscal 2015. We've been investing to increase awareness and trial of our brands and products in North America, which is a key catalyst for growth in categories like Fabric Care and Grooming. We're starting to see the benefits, and this should improve in the second half of the year.","We're launching a number of new consumer-preferred premium innovations over the next few months and early in the second half of the fiscal year in both developed and developing markets. We're investing in selling coverage to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest growing channels and strengthen our presence in our most important markets. All these efforts along with annualizing some of the most significant impacts from last fiscal year give us confidence in a stronger second quarter and second half.","The headwind from foreign exchange has increased since the start of year. We now expect FX will have a five to six percentage point impact on all-in sales growth. Also, the combined impact of the Venezuela deconsolidation and minor brand divestures will have a two to three percentage point drag on all-in sales growth. Taken together, we expect all-in sales to be down high single digits versus restated fiscal 2015 results.","Bottom line outcomes are, frankly, much more difficult to assess given the market and foreign exchange rate volatility. For now, we're maintaining our outlook for core earnings per share growth of slightly below to up mid-single digits versus year ago. We will invest where it's appropriate to do so. We will not cut smart investment to offset foreign exchange impacts, which means we could very well end up below the guidance range. On the other hand, we're working to accelerate and enhance productivity, and commodities have generally been a help. We'll see how things develop, and we'll update you as needed. We're also maintaining our all-in GAAP earnings per share growth outlook of up 53% to 63%.","With continued strong operating margin expansion, we expect to deliver core operating income growth of mid to high single digits. This includes the $0.05 to $0.06 per share drag on operating earnings from the deconsolidation of results in our Venezuelan business, and it includes $0.02 to $0.03 per share of Beauty deal transition costs that will remain in our core earnings results. So strong underlying operating earnings progress, which excluding the $0.08 impact from these items should be up high singles to low double digits.","Our key assumptions on items below the core operating profit line have not changed. We continue to expect non-operating income will be a two to three percentage point drag on core earnings per share growth, mainly impacting the fourth quarter. The core effective tax rate should be about 24% for fiscal 2016, about three points higher than last year. Combined, non-operating income and tax will be a six to seven percentage point impact on core earnings per share growth.","Finally and importantly, we expect to retire shares at a value of approximately $8 billion to $9 billion through a combination of direct share repurchase and shares that will be exchanged in the Duracell transaction. In addition to the shares we expect to retire, we expect dividend payments of more than $7 billion, in total $15 billion to $16 billion in dividend payments, share exchanges, and share repurchase.","Going forward, we are committed to balanced top and bottom line growth and strong free cash flow productivity to drive total shareholder return. We will address gaps if and when they emerge. We will defend our positions. And we will invest behind trial and awareness programs, and of course consumer-preferred innovation. We'll do everything we can from a productivity standpoint. We'll smartly invest to accelerate top line growth, and we'll continue delivering on our commitment of strong cash return to shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available in slides, which will be posted on our website, www.PG.com, following the call. With that, I'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara, Wells Fargo.","Christopher Ferrara - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Jon, I guess can you quantify the gross margin impact maybe of some of that category SKU cleanup that you're doing? And then I guess as a follow-up to that, how long does it last? I think the three examples you gave were maybe 10 basis points each. You said 100 basis points, which is a pretty big deal. I guess how long has that been going on? How long do think it lasts? What's the gross margin impact of it?","And then if you can, the outlook into October, what's been going on? How much of that is maybe some of this going away? What drives the confidence in October being sticky? Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","So I would say that we are midway through the portfolio cleanup of the core businesses. For example, the Mexico tissue towel move really was just effective in July. The Laundry moves span the end of last fiscal year and the beginning of this fiscal year. So we're about in the middle of that with still some more work to do, so that will continue to have an impact on the top line. Obviously, as you point out, that's a gross margin accretive endeavor. I honestly haven't worked to calculate that specifically, Chris, so we'll have to give you some perspective offline on that.","Relative to confidence in Q2 and going forward, there are several things that drive us from where we are to where we'll be. The big core businesses that we've been working on are continuing to strengthen. So I talked about Fabric Care and Baby Care in the U.S., where market growth has improved as a result of innovation in the category, where our shares are continuing to increase. Baby Care actually we're selling through our capacity currently and are on allocation, so that will come off over time and that will be a help.","Importantly, some of the other structural items we've been working to address, we've talked Mexico. We've talked China. Mexico is progressing very nicely. They had a quarter that I think indexed 98 versus a year ago, which is up pretty significantly from where it's been, and we expect that to turn to a positive index next quarter. China we also expect progress as we bring these premium innovations to market, as I described, and as we continue to draw down some of the inventory that's in the trade.","And also, as I mentioned, we're increasing investment where it makes sense in smart ways to drive trial and sampling of our products, particularly at points of market entry and points of market change, and the early returns on those are encouraging. So that's the simple story going forward. Again, we're fairly confident that the second quarter will be a quarter of growth organically on the top line. And we're fairly confident that the growth will strengthen as we move through the fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz, Deutsche Bank.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Jon. Good morning.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning, Bill.","William G. Schmitz - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, can we talk about the EM versus developed market growth, so what the two growth rates were? And then how much do you think of the market share softness is you guys deciding to exit categories versus just losing to competitors? And then how long do you think that is going to last? So are we a point at P&G where the big negative mix from emerging markets will be cleaned up in the not too distant future because you've exited a lot of this low-end stuff, which was horribly gross margin dilutive, because obviously historically some of the low-margin mix stuff in emerging markets on that business grew so rapidly, had a huge onerous impact on the company broadly? So have you made significant progress on that front where the negative mix on the emerging markets business will be a lot less going forward?","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","So the split of organic sales growth developed\/developing, developed was minus 1%, developing was minus 2%. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that Brazil and China were significant impacts in driving that minus 2% in developing, as was, as you rightly point out, some of the portfolio cleanup efforts, which are disproportionately developing market activities. Yes, as Chris asked, they will improve gross margin. They will improve operating margin. And yes, that will help reduce negative mix impact from disproportionate growth should it resume in developing markets.","As I mentioned in my response to Chris's answer, there is still work to do. So if this was a quarter or next quarter was a quarter where developing markets grew faster than developed markets, we would still have a negative mix on the margin line, but it is getting better.","Operator","Your next question comes line from the line of John Faucher, JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Jon, you guys talk a lot about competitive activity in the press release and it's mentioned for each GBU, which I guess relates to your view of FX-related pricing versus your competitors' view of FX-related pricing. So can you talk a little bit about why you guys feel the need to maybe take more pricing than what you're seeing? Is that just simply okay, European-based companies see less of a need, what have you? Because I guess it seems like you might be better off maybe taking less pricing and delivering 100 basis points of gross margin expansion versus 250 basis points. So how should we think about that balance and why you guys maybe need to take more pricing than your competitors?","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","We start from a position of a stronger currency than many of our competitors. So I mentioned in the prepared remarks, Russia is an example of what we're dealing with, 40% devaluation. Both euro and yen functional currency competitors are dealing with about 20%. So that dollar dynamic against all currencies, including the euro and the yen, drives a bigger issue. That doesn't mean that we will necessarily price more. We need to be pragmatic in what we do. I've talked before about recovering less through pricing this time around and recovering more through a combination of mix and cost savings, which we are doing.","We're in the period of the cycle where we have made our moves. We're typically first in that endeavor just because of the fact that we're the market leaders in many of these markets, and competitors are beginning to respond. I obviously can't talk in a lot of granularity about pricing from a competitive standpoint. But what I will tell you is that the moves in the market are generally constructive, not all constructive and not all well understood. This is something we'll continue to work against every day, every week, and we'll do it very pragmatically. I'm not interested in price levels that are not sustainable. Obviously, our consumers are not interested in those levels of pricing either. But for example, in Russia where we had negative gross margins as a result of currency devaluation, we simply have to make a move. Making a choice to maintain stronger top line growth with negative margins is just a value-destructive activity.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. So, Jon, I'm still struggling a bit with the emerging markets trends. Obviously, the rationalization on the lower end is having some impact, but it's a business with nearly $25 billion in sales in aggregate. It's still kind of hard for me to understand conceptually how you guys are posting declines when most of your peers at least so far this quarter are more in the high single-digit or double-digit type of growth range. So I was just hoping you could give us a bit more detail on what you think is driving the underperformance. How much of it is the portfolio rationalization? Is there a greater macro impact, or what are the key factors behind it, again, on a relative basis, and then the plans to close that gap going forward? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. The biggest \u2013 let's just talk BRIC markets. China, our second largest market, so it makes a significant difference both from a top line and bottom line standpoint, we have not fully accessed the opportunity that the market is presenting in terms of growth in the premium price tiers as consumers look for better, more differentiated solutions, and frankly, higher product quality. We are bringing those items to market now, but our absence in those price tiers has, frankly, hurt us fairly significantly. Diapers is a good example that I mentioned, where we're still the market leader with Pampers, but we're really not present in the portions of the market that are growing, which are the top tier, which will now be with both a pants and a taped offering. We've also talked about some trade channel and inventory cleanup that has been ongoing, and that work continues as well. So China was down 8% on the quarter on an organic basis.","Russia is the next largest big developing market for us, and we've talked a little bit both in the prepared remarks and in the Q&A on some of the challenges that presents us. And we're the largest player again by a factor of three in both Russia and the Ukraine. So the impacts there are disproportional. Having said that, Russia is actually holding up fairly well, 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. When you consider everything that's going on, that's a pretty good number, but obviously well below the numbers that we were posting a year ago or two years ago.","Brazil is very volatile. We just took some pricing there. It's hard to sort through the trends. Last quarter we were up 7%. This quarter we were down 12%. But if you look at consumption in the marketplace, it's essentially flat. So I think that's another one of those items that should reverse itself as we move forward here.","And India, I've talked about the moves that we've made to increase profitability, albeit at some cost to the top line.","I realize that's not an exhaustive comparison across the competitive set. But just with those four dynamics that I've described in those four big markets, I think it at least helps understand why our results in developing may not be as strong as some of the others and why that has a large impact on the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.","Stephen R. Powers - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, so I guess just a question on guidance. Versus the outlook a quarter ago, it looks like you're now expecting your overall top line three to four points worse than in early August, and obviously you held your EPS guidance for now. So I guess really two things. First, the two to three point headwind from minor brand divestitures and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, how much of that wasn't known a few months ago because Venezuela itself wasn't new this quarter, unless I'm mistaken?","And then second, the new guidance seems to imply EBIT margins about 100 basis points better rough math versus the guidance a quarter ago when you factor in that top line reduction, which is $600 million \u2013 $700 million. So where is that margin being sourced from? I know you mentioned commodities. But planned productivity has to be a big role, and I'm just curious where that's going to be targeted.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Steve. The two to three points on Venezuela and divestitures is not new. You're absolutely right about that. We didn't explicitly talk it in the last call. We wanted to make sure that was clear, so we put it in this call. There's an implicit assumption that one has to make when one tries to determine how much more EBIT we're expecting, and that assumption is where we actually are in the guidance range. So while we've retained our range, that doesn't mean that we're necessarily at the top or the middle of that range. And there is a ton of moving pieces, as I indicated.","There is some good news there relative to the productivity savings that you saw come through in the first quarter. Frankly, those were larger than we were expecting, and also there has been some commodity help. But honestly, as I tried to indicate in my prepared remarks, I'm not overly fixated right now on guidance or updating guidance simply because it's very difficult to do. What I'm fixated on is getting the right choices made, being as productive as we possibly can in doing that, and the guidance will be what it will be, but at this point no change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy C. Nicholson - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. I have just a couple quick follow-ups and then a real question. My first follow-up is in terms of the gross margin specifically, I have to go back five years to find a first quarter that has a gross margin as strong as the one you've put up. And are you saying, just in terms of net of investments, was the gross margin you put up a function of product mix and the pricing you've taken, et cetera, et cetera? Is this a new base for the first quarter gross margin, or do you feel like if you could turn the clock back, you should have spent more and maybe this gross margin is going to prove to have been inflated?","My second follow-up is just, again, I hear you say that your outlook for global category growth has gone from 4% to 3%. If that's the case, why do you still feel like you can put up the same organic growth that you did before? I don't understand why you wouldn't have brought that down in concert with that change.","And then sorry for the last question, but over the last month we've seen the news that Tarek [Farahat] is leaving from Brazil, and Martin [Riant] is leaving. And the last time we had a really new CEO when Bob came in, there was an enormous amount of transition in management. And I think my take was that that led to an enormous amount of volatility and disruption across the organization. So the question is do you expect \u2013 is the number of management transitions and changes to continue? Do you think there are going to be more? And if that's the case, how is David going to manage this transition and period of change better than Bob [McDonald] did because it seems like more change is not what you need right now? Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","On gross margin, we've mentioned productivity. We've mentioned pricing. We've mentioned commodities. All of those impacted the gross margin results we delivered. John [Chevalier] can give you the details offline. But within the gross margin number of 250 basis points, 170 basis points of that is savings, there's 80 basis points of pricing benefit, there's 110 basis points of commodity benefit, and then there are of course some offsets to that.","So how much of that is sustainable going forward? The commodities will sustain itself until it annualizes, obviously, and so that's probably as big as it's going to get. And pricing will also annualize itself over time. We would hope that some level of productivity savings in cost of goods would continue as we continue to localize production and sourcing and as we continue to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing operations.","In terms of the organic top line, again, this is a question of ranges in a sense. Our guidance is flat to up low singles. The quarter we just posted was minus 1%. We're talking about improvement in Q2, with strengthening beyond that. So even if Q2 was zero, which we're not anticipating, and the back half was plus 1%, we'd still be within that guidance range. So we just don't see a reason to change the guidance range. Where we come out within that is a matter that we'll have to work against and a matter that you'll have to assess.","In terms of organization change, I really don't want to speak for David. He'll begin interacting with this group shortly, and I'll let him communicate his view on that. My view is we have a very strong team. I believe we have made changes. We've both made changes and individuals have made changes relative to their own plans as a result of the announcements that have been made and as a result of the situation in the business. So I don't see a period personally of very high volatility in management staffing going forward. I think this period will be characterized by a lot more continuity than, frankly, either when the transition with Bob occurred or has been the case over the last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, good morning, so a couple things, two follow-ups just like Wendy had, and then a separate one. So first was just on the Venezuela deconsolidation and product exits. I got a little more confused, Jon. You had said that you guys had always included in the guidance but we weren't aware of it, so you're just being more explicit this quarter. But yet the net sales guidance did get worse, so I'm just a little confused. Why call it out now?","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Something did change. Okay, so that's one.","Two is you mentioned in the introduction in your first bit of prepared remarks about making value investments and then nothing afterward. So I was curious where you've maybe adjusted pricing a little bit, maybe in Russia went a little bit too far, so anything there.","And then finally, it was also in the press release. I thought the language was interesting about we will invest smartly, like future tense, not currently. So you gave some examples I think of where you're already maybe investing at a full load, like Fabric and Baby in the U.S. But where are areas that you're not yet investing at what you would call a full level? And does that imply that maybe marketing spending starts to climb up again in the second half as you have more of this innovation or product plans in place that you're comfortable supporting? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. On the top line, the change quarter to quarter is really FX in terms of what causes us to take that all-in number down. And again, John can take you through the details there, but that's the primary driver of the change.","In terms of investments in consumer value equation, you're right that we did roll back some of the price increases that we took in Russia, consistent with our ongoing dialogue about how we'll manage that situation. I want to be very careful about price signaling, so I can't really talk about decisions that have been made to address additional price gaps, but those decisions have been made. And that's the case both in developing markets but also some developed market price gaps that need to be addressed.","And on the question of investment, yes, we expect marketing to increase this year on both an absolute basis and a percentage of sales basis. By marketing, I mean working dollars, so we're going to continue to fund increases in spending that matters with reduction in spending that doesn't. And look, if I was asked to spend an additional $1 billion tomorrow, I could obviously do that, but that's not the question. The question is can we earn a return on that and create value through that investment. And as we have more to invest behind, and you rightly mentioned the product portfolio, for example, as we're bringing these innovations to market, we will do that.","I think you saw \u2013 I don't have the numbers right in front of me. But in your conference in Boston in the fall, we showed pretty significant increases in marketing support where we did have a reason to invest behind unit dose in Laundry in the U.S., behind the Hair Care innovations, et cetera. So look, let me just be as clear as I can about this. We don't like the top line situation. We don't accept the top line situation. We will fix the top line situation, but we need to do that in ways that are smart and sustainable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joseph Nicholas Altobello - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. First question I guess for you, Jon, in terms of the EPS guide for this year, I'm just trying to bridge it from last year $3.76 because if you look at the headwinds you guys have, I know you're well aware of this, they add up to about somewhere between $0.60 and $0.65 by our math. So I'm just trying to figure out what the positives are here. Obviously, the cost of goods savings you guys have called out is $1.2 billion, but I'm not sure if you guys have talked about the tailwind from commodities this year. I've got roughly $400 million in my notes here and maybe what kind of overhead savings you guys are expecting to try to bridge that $0.65 gap, if you will, number one.","And then number two, if you look at Duracell and the Beauty brands you guys are selling, obviously you are selling them but they're still part of your business. So how much of a distraction are they in terms of your day-to-day operations until you do divest those businesses? Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","So the other drivers of improvement, you mentioned commodities. You're in the order, right order of magnitude, probably $450 million. It's gotten a little better. There are overhead savings. We had pretty significant reductions in enrollment last year. There are non-working marketing savings I mentioned in the prepared remarks, another $200 million reduction in marketing, and those are all things that are helping us.","In terms of the distraction on the businesses that we're running through discontinued operations, I wouldn't label it in any way a distraction. We're fully committed to optimize and manage those businesses just as if we still own them because, guess what, we do. What we haven't been able to do and what I look forward to being able to do, I know we all look forward to being able to do, is as those divestitures close, being able to focus all of our energy and effort on these 10 product categories where we feel very confident we can make a difference. So that is not fully activated, if you will, as we continue managing the business, frankly, much as we did last year.","Operator","Your next question comes to the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. First on the savings, you had a very good start to the year and probably better than you guys had expected. So first, can you talk about the sustainability of that? Because in past years you've tended to see the savings build as the year progresses. So has the cadence of that changed or could we even see more in terms of a savings acceleration there?","And then just on the top line, I understand clearly there has been a ton of change over the last, let's call it, 24 months, the productivity improvements, the transformation of the portfolio, the exit of less profitable businesses. But even if you add back those minor divestitures, you still would have probably put up an organic sales decline or you would have put up an organic sales decline in three of the five segments. So you gave some examples about Brazil and China and a couple of other geographies. But can you talk through what's underlying that? Maybe what are you factoring in terms of macros when you look for that acceleration in growth as the year progresses? Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So the savings number was indeed significant. And as I said, it was more actually than we were expecting to see. We were very happy to see that, and that gives us more confidence in our savings objectives going forward. As with past years, the incremental savings should build as the year goes on. The area that there will be less sequential progress is in overhead, simply because the reduction this year is not as significant as it was last year. And from a marketing standpoint, we're going to be spending those savings back behind the things that we've been talking about. So I actually haven't looked at the quarter-by-quarter cadence. I've been working to get this quarter wrapped up, but I know John can give you some perspective on that.","In terms of the top line, the simple way to look at it, I would argue that on an adjusted basis or an underlying basis, top line is currently growing at about 1%, which again is nothing we're happy with. How do I get from minus 1% to 1%? There's about a point of the portfolio cleanup. There's also about a point of one-time impacts. So for example, I mentioned that we're selling through our capacity on Baby Care in the U.S., and that's constraining the amount of growth that's possible. We're making adjustments, for example, in inventory levels. We're through that in Mexico. We're getting through that in China.","So if you take all of that out, and by the way, I'm not suggesting one should, I'm just trying to answer your question, you get to about a plus 1% running rate. And from there, as I mentioned, when we're able to fully activate the things that are working and address some of the things that aren't working, that should accelerate. There's no reason that we should be comfortable with growth that's any less than the rate of the market growth over time. I'm not talking about a quarter here or quarter there but in total, and that's what we're committed to work towards.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hello. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to this issue of volatility in emerging markets because there is an internal element to it, meaning pricing decisions. And I'm glad to learn that Russia and Mexico are normalizing, but there were deep contractions in the prior quarter, and they were caused either because too much promotions or too heavy price increases. Now China is down 8%, baby and diapers are down 3% \u2013 4% at a time that they should have benefited from big launches that A.G. [Lafley] has spoken being rolled out in July. So why this volatility is not self-inflicted, if you will, and is not a byproduct of head count reductions and changes in the role of the GBUs and local markets that you now call SMOs [Sales and Market Operations]? Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","First of all, to address specifically the point of minus 3% in Babies and Family, that's driven by a couple things. One, in Feminine Care, we're comping the big launch of Discreet, the adult incontinence product, so that has an impact. Two, I mentioned the Family Care choices and I mentioned their one point impact on that category. Three, I mentioned Baby Care softness outside the U.S. and the fact that we're really just getting the products in the marketplace in China that will allow us to compete with effectiveness in the premium tier. So really it's not self-induced volatility. It's those things that I just described.","In terms of pricing for FX in an uncertain competitive and consumer environment, there will be volatility. We need to work to get that as right as we can and reduce the volatility, but I don't think it's just a realistic expectation that there won't be any of that volatility. I think we also confuse ourselves a little bit when we look quarter to quarter. These things always have big impacts, usually first positive, and then negative; positive as you announce a price increase and volume sells in ahead of that price increase, negative afterwards as that inventory is drawn down and as consumers adjust to the new pricing in the marketplace. So this is somewhat of just a reality of our times, if you will. Again, I don't excuse the need to be as proficient and effective and efficient in this area as we need to be. That's certainly what we're striving for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. I have a few things. One is just to know if Dave Taylor will be on these quarterly calls or just on the fiscal year-end call. Two, why are you not buying back more stock if you think things will improve? It only looks like $0.5 billion.","And then on that improvement story, we've had false starts on the same kind of discourse or soliloquy before, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you guys haven't been happy with your top line for a while. So why should investors believe you this time that things will improve? And specifically on this volume point, again, we've seen that every segment says competitive activity and price increases were negative on volume. What tactically are you doing differently? What are you bringing to bear differently now to get out of that situation? And specifically, I want to know if it's finally, finally, finally closing some of these price gaps versus your competition where you're losing share, this tight fisted (53:40) image that we at least have, or are you just waiting and hoping for competition to go away as FX eases? Because you do say building awareness, you do say sometimes closing value gaps, but I really want to know if we should expect your price gaps to close where you're losing share and what you're modeling for your competitive response in that instance.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ali. Honestly, David and I have not had a chance to talk about how we're going to proceed going forward with the totality of investor interaction. But he will be certainly well represented, is already interacting with investors. We have a day scheduled here November 4, I think some of you know \u2013 November 5, and he'll join us for that as well. So we will get David fully involved, and we'll update you on just exactly how that's going to work when we have a better view of that.","In terms of your comment on dialogue versus soliloquy, I certainly hope that this is a dialogue. That's what I look forward to. I get no value out of a soliloquy. And you've been good in this regard in terms of maintaining a very active dialogue, which I appreciate.","On the question on price gaps and where we're losing share, I would say things fall into three or four buckets, and it's not one solution solves everything. There are some places like the bad businesses I've described where losing share is the right thing to do. And so those share losses we're going to work to get behind us and get to a profitable position so that growth is worth something. There are cases, as I've mentioned, where we do need to adjust pricing, and we will do that. There are other cases where improvement in the value equation that's required to reverse share loss comes through a much better product offering, where the benefits of that offering are much more clearly communicated to consumers. And it comes with getting that preferred, better product in consumers' hands, not just telling them about it, but allowing them to experience it.","I talked about investments in sampling and trial. We frankly haven't been as strong as we need to be at key sampling and trial opportunities, specifically points of market entry and points of market change, and we're strengthening our programs there. I mentioned putting 25 million FlexBall razors in the hands of men across the world. Telling them about that product is one thing. Putting it in their hands changes the dynamic pretty significantly. And another example where we're working to strengthen that is in Laundry, where we're increasing our washing machine sampling, and importantly, we're doing that for the first time with unit dose. So consumers get to experience our best, most convenient product as they set up their household. So it's really across the board. But yes, where we do need to address value gaps, we will. Again, how you do that is going to differ by individual situation.","On share repurchase, we're committed to the same amount of repurchase that I described on the last call. That hasn't changed. Recall that with the Duracell transaction, there's a significant cash component. And so we've been managing our share repurchase pattern, if you will, with full knowledge of that. That is coming up in the first part of the year, and also with an eye towards what our credit metrics are. But we will repurchase shares on an increasing rate as we move forward here.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, Jon.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jason.","Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to touch on a couple of questions that others have already touched on. It was encouraging to hear your comments in regards to John Faucher's question about competitors generally beginning to follow your lead on pricing. But I think a few other instances you've referenced, you may be positioning to go the other way on a go-forward. And I was intrigued by your comment of increasing investment at points of market entry and points of market change. That sounded like a fancy way of saying more promotions, more sampling, more couponing. So A), is that the right interpretation? And B), back to Ali's question, what do you expect competitors to do on a go-forward, and could that even create more problems down the road?","And the second part, sticking with point of sale and execution, you're fairly far in now to the change in merchandising in the U.S. with the partnership with Acosta and Kraft. Can you update us on what you've learned, how it's progressed, and maybe how it's changing as you evolve with those learnings, and of course, Kraft changes ownership hands? Thank you.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","We will not, in most cases, be looking to promotion as a way to strengthen our business. We will be competitive where we need to be, but that is not going to be something that we proactively increase. We may increase trade spending at any point in time as a mechanism of adjusting price, but generally that's not our game. If you look at price, which includes promotion as a driver of top line, it had a two point \u2013 it was a two point positive impact in the quarter we just completed. It's been a positive impact for the last 20 quarters and a positive impact for the last 11 years. So we are not going to be using that as a way to improve our situation, but we will remain competitive.","The reason for that is fairly straightforward. There's nothing that is really proprietary in that. So as you rightly indicated, that's the mechanism we use to adjust every value equation. That can be undone very quickly and very easily. We'd much prefer to establish superior value equations with superior products that are adequately supported. And that's also the reason why maybe the top line isn't turning as quickly as certainly we would like or understandably as you would like because we're not going to spend money just to spend money. We're not going to spend money in ways that are not sustainable in terms of generating growth in a profitable way on our business.","And I apologize, Jason, I'm just not that familiar with the Acosta\/Kraft dynamics at a granular level, so I need to pass on that one. But again, we can try to get you that perspective offline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks, good morning. Hey, Jon, just to follow up on David Taylor, who will start in 10 days, should we view everything you've been saying and the state of the state as part of the way he's thinking, or is there a timeframe beyond the November meeting or sometime by year end that he's going to lay out any kind of different path? I'm just trying to understand that. And then just as a follow-up, is the timing on Duracell still March-ish? Is that what you were saying?","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","The timing on Duracell should be the January \u2013 March quarter. And within that, I don't have a month nailed down, but it should be in that quarter.","Obviously, from a substance standpoint, I don't want to front-run David and so do not want to be representing his point of view. I want him to represent his point of view. We will look for opportunities to do that as soon as it's practical. Obviously, he starts November 1. We get pretty quickly into the holiday season then. And so at minimum, what we've said is that David will join us when we're all together at CAGNY. And I think also by that time, you can have some more conviction on what he indicates the path forward is simply because he'll have had the appropriate amount of time to develop that thinking. But as I said, we'll look for any opportunity we can to increase exposure as time goes on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks and good morning, everybody. Jon, I wanted to understand a little bit \u2013 vet maybe the balance of the price and volume going forward. Just broadly, what is in your expectations for the year, and then perhaps if that's changed along with expectations for global growth rates?","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","We do expect improvement in volume as we go through the year. It will be lower than sales, so pricing will be a bigger driver for the balance of the year. Obviously, that gap will narrow as we go through quarter by quarter. I apologize, I forgot the second part of your question. But you can feel free to call me, I apologize.","Operator","Your final question comes the line of Alicia Forry with Canaccord.","Alicia A. Forry - Canaccord Genuity Ltd.","Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been answered here. But just to press you a bit more on the competitive activity that we've all been focusing on, I was wondering if you could give us any color on whether that has intensified at all versus recent trends, or if it's more of the same, just a bit weaker generally around the world, but some more color. And then, if you could, possibly contrast the competitive activity that you're seeing in emerging markets versus mature markets, if there are any significant differences in the nature of that competition.","And then just finally, on disposals, I know that at the Coty call you guys said that basically you've completed your intended major disposals. But I was just wondering if maybe could we see a handful of the larger non-core brands being sold over the next 12 to 18 months because it looks to me like there are still possible areas that could be considered non-core to the strategy. Thanks.","Jon R. Moeller - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Alicia. The competitive activity we're seeing is actually pretty constructive, as I mentioned earlier, both on the pricing front and on the product front. So the big driver of competition, for example, in China in Baby Care, is product-based innovation at the premium end. That's very constructive from a market standpoint. If we look at competitive activity, for instance, in the Laundry market in the U.S., take Personal as an example, that's product-based innovation at the premium end. We haven't been as well positioned as we need to be to respond to some of that, some of those moves, like for instance in Baby Care in China. But it's generally constructive. There are pockets here and there where things happen that we wouldn't have chosen, but broadly good competition.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

Today\u2019s discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.","Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Core EPS refers to earnings per share from continuing operations excluding certain items. Core operating margin and core operating profit growth refer to operating profit and margin excluding certain items. Core effective tax rate refers to the effective tax rate adjusted for certain items.","P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon R. Moeller","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Bob McDonald and Teri List.","I'll begin today's call with a summary of our second quarter results, and Teri will provide highlights for some of our largest product categories. I'll provide some perspective on our revised outlook for the second half of the year, and I'll conclude the call with guidance for fiscal year 2012 and the March quarter. We'll take questions after our prepared remarks and we'll be available following the call to provide additional perspective. We will also be posting slides containing business segment information on our website, www.pg.com, following the call.","Our second quarter underlying results were in line with our going-in expectations. Organic sales came in at the midpoint of our estimates, with core earnings per share towards the high end of our guidance range. All-in sales growth was 4%. Organic sales growth was also 4% as foreign exchange had essentially neutral impact on the quarter. Top line growth was broad-based, with all 6 reporting segments growing organic sales for the second consecutive quarter.","Organic volume was up 1%. This was on the low side of our expectations, due mainly to a mid-single-digit volume decline in developed markets. Developed market volume was negatively affected by weak economic conditions and pricing taken to offset higher input costs. We continue to see strong growth in developing markets, which are delivering high-single-digit volume growth for the quarter.","Pricing contributed 4 points to organic sales growth, making this the third consecutive quarter where pricing has added at least 3 points to sales growth. Pricing was up in all 6 reporting segments. Mix reduced sales growth by 1% due mainly to the disproportionate growth from developing markets.","We're pleased with these top line results, particularly given the developed market dynamics. There's been little to no growth in our categories in developed markets. In fact, market sizes are actually down in several big category\/country combinations, such as laundry detergents in the U.K., diapers in the U.S. and Japan, and shampoos in many Western European countries. We've been able to offset this with the progress we're making in developing markets. We've consistently delivered high-single to low-double-digit organic sales growth in these markets and their importance to P&G's global business is increasing rapidly.","Just 5 years ago, developing markets represented only 27% of our global sales. They grew to 35% last year and they should reach about 37% of sales and about 45% of volume by the end of this fiscal year. Importantly, they've accounted for more than 80% of our organic sales growth so far this year.","We're growing share and building scale in these fast-growing countries. Our BRIC markets have averaged double-digit top line growth for the past 2 years. Our top 11 emerging markets have added about 0.5 share points for the past 12-, 6- and 3-month periods. We've expanded our portfolio to roughly 40 new category\/country combinations in developing markets over the last 18 months, with 10 more scheduled for the balance of this fiscal year. Recent expansions have included Safeguard in Africa, Downy in Indonesia and Oral-B in Nigeria. And we'll be continuing our Oral Care expansion with Oral-B toothpaste in Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Peru in the next few months.","Despite the macro challenges, we have numerous opportunities for growth in developed markets. As I mentioned, some big categories are declining, but others such as toothpaste and shampoos in the U.S. and U.K. are still growing at a mid-single-digit pace.","The antidote for slow market growth is innovation. We'll continue to leverage successful innovations such as Crest 3D White, Downy Unstopables and Fusion ProGlide. We'll also drive growth with commercial innovation such as our global multi-brand Olympics campaign. We'll continue to field strong marketing programs. In addition, we will continue to fill in white spaces in our developed market portfolios to compete in both more super premium and value-priced tiers.","Our objective is to continue growing share, and through this, growing sales in developed markets, but we're realistic about the challenges that exist.","Global market share for the quarter was essentially in line with prior year levels. We held or grew share in 9 of our top 15 countries, 3 of our 6 reporting segments and on 11 of our 24 billion-dollar brands. Market share was in line or higher in businesses representing about 45% of global sales. This is a reduction from the roughly 60% level we've seen over the last several quarters. As we've noted on many occasions, we expected a fair amount of market share volatility, given the amount of pricing we've been implementing and considering that P&G has often been the first manufacturer to raise prices in many categories.","In most cases, we expect the share impacts to be temporary as our competitive price gaps are now slowly narrowing. In a few cases, such as auto dishwashing and laundry powder categories in the U.S., we have announced corrective actions to ensure our brands continue to be an excellent value for consumers relative to competitive offerings.","Shifting to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.10, towards the top end of our guidance range. This represents a decline of 3% versus the prior year as the impact of higher commodity costs and a significant tax rate headwind more than offset the benefits from solid sales growth and cost savings. Results also included the impact of a divestiture of the PUR business.","All-in earnings were $0.57 per share. This includes $0.53 per share of noncore charges, primarily to write-down, goodwill and certain intangibles in the Appliances and Salon Professional business. The impairment charges are onetime and noncash in nature. They are the outcome of the annual discipline process we undertake to assess the goodwill and intangibles carrying value of all of our businesses and brands.","In each of the last 2 fiscal years, we've highlighted in our Annual Report -- in last year's report it's on Page 49 -- and in our 10-K, that the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses had a heightened risk of future goodwill and intangibles impairment. Both of these businesses have been negatively impacted by the weak economic environment. Both businesses are in high-priced discretionary categories where market sizes have been declining. And both have a portfolio mix skewed very heavily toward the Western European market. In fact, around 50% of sales from each business are from Western Europe, about 2.5x more than the average business in our portfolio.","While still positive, we've reduced our forecast for out period growth, which leads to reduced intangibles and goodwill value. These charges do not diminish the strategic attractiveness of these businesses or our commitment to them.","Moving back to the drivers of our core results. Gross margin declined 210 basis points. The combination of pricing, cost savings and fixed cost leverage improved gross margin by roughly 310 basis points. These benefits were more than offset by a 300 basis point negative impact from higher commodity and energy costs and a 220 basis point negative impact from geographic and product mix.","SG&A costs were down about 50 basis points on a core basis, due mainly to sales growth leverage and a reduction in overhead spending.","Core operating profit margin declined 160 basis points due to the reduction in gross margin.","The effective all-in tax rate for the quarter was 36.7%, an unusually high rate due to the nature of the noncore charges affecting the quarter, the majority of which are not tax deductible. Excluding the impact of noncore items, the effective tax rate on core earnings was 24.9%, which can pays -- excuse me, compares to a base period core tax rate of 22.3%. This difference equates to a $0.04 per share headwind on core EPS growth for the quarter.","We generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and we returned $2 billion of cash to shareholders this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. At the current annualized dividend of $2.10 per share, our dividend yield is approximately 3.2%.","Now I'll turn the call over to Teri to review some of the highlights of our business results.","Teri L. List-Stoll","Thanks, Jon. Similar to last quarter, I won't be covering all of the details of our 6 reporting segments. But instead, we'll review highlights from some of our larger businesses. For more information on business segment results, please refer to the press release we issued this morning and slides that will be posted on our website, pg.com, at the conclusion of this call.","Starting with the Beauty segment. We delivered organic volume and sales growth of 2%. Retail Hair Care led the growth, with organic volume up mid-single digits and global value share up slightly. Asia growth was strong and broad-based, with volume up mid-teens and value share increasing behind -- nearly 1 point. India Pantene shipments increased over 80% behind sachet distribution expansion into 2 million stores in the first 5 months of launch. China Head & Shoulders shipments were up over 25%.","In developed markets, North America Hair Care faced high levels of competitive promotional spending, leading to a mid-single-digit shipment decline. We launched both product and commercial innovation on Pantene and Head & Shoulders this month, which have generated a positive response from customers and consumers.","Global retail Skin Care shipments were about flat. Asia volume increased mid-single digits, fueled by growth in our recent expansion markets including India, South Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia. The North America business continued to face challenges with high levels of competition, predominantly in the mid-priced tier, where Olay has less shelf presence. The brand is introducing new products to better compete in this fast-growing segment of the brand -- of the market.","In the Grooming segment, blades and razors volume increased low single digits. Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa shipments increased double digits, largely behind expansion of Fusion ProGlide, which is now available in over 30 markets around the world. In Western Europe, value share was flat, but volume declined high single digits in a contracting market. In North America, Fusion delivered strong results, growing share by over 1 point. This gain was offset by losses in Mach3 in the legacy Gillette business as we continue to face high levels of competitive promotional activity. We recently began conversations with customers regarding how we will support all tiers of our blades and razors portfolio.","In the Health Care segment, Oral Care volume was down low single digits. North America volume was about flat as the business indexed against a very strong base period and faced significant competitive pressure. We're very encouraged that despite the highly promotional environment, Crest 3D White continued to grow, with value share up over 0.5 points versus year ago.","Globally, our Oral-B toothpaste expansion markets delivered results ahead of expectation. Brazil toothpaste value share grew for the 11th consecutive quarter. U.K. toothpaste share is over 7% and Belgian toothpaste value share is over 18%, up 6 points versus year ago. All of our wave one markets have achieved double-digit shares, and as Jon mentioned, we're continuing the Oral-B toothpaste expansion. We started shipping in Colombia earlier this month and we will launch in Chile, Argentina and Peru in the near future.","In the Fabric and Home Care segment, we delivered organic sales growth of 5% behind flat volumes, mix rate of 1% and a pricing benefit of 6%. Global Fabric Care shipments were flat, with developing markets growing mid-single digits and developed markets declining mid-single. Asia led the growth as India delivered a second straight quarter of laundry shipments increasing over 25%, with growth across the portfolio. China also delivered a strong quarter, growing share behind the Ariel upgrade and relaunch in November.","Fabric Care developed markets were a story of mixed results. On the positive side, French volume grew high single digits and Ariel delivered record value share of nearly 25%. U.S. Downy grew value share nearly 1 point behind Downy Unstopables. However, both the U.K. and U.S. laundry market lost share as we faced consumer value disadvantages from price increases we took last calendar year. Pricing intervention plans in powder detergents have been announced to the trade, and we expect to regain volume and share growth with a strong innovation program planned for laundry over the next 6 to 12 months.","As many of you know, we'll begin selling Tide PODS in less than 1 month. Due to a combination of increased customer demand and manufacturing challenges, we're beginning with a shelf-only launch and we'll add merchandising during the back half of the calendar year. We expect Tide PODS will be one of our top initiatives this year and potentially the biggest launch in the U.S. consumer product industry.","Global Home Care delivered solid results. Shipments increased low single digits and we held global value share with 4 of 5 regions flat or growing. The main challenge for the business is the U.S. auto dish category, where we increased prices last June by 8% on average. Since this time, the consumer value versus competitive products has been outside of our tolerance range and we've seen share losses of more than 7 points. This is not something that we are willing to accept and we have taken corrective actions. In December, we announced to the trade that effective in February, we will be reversing our price increase on the Cascade business. This is disappointing but necessary to protect our competitive position. We will aggressively pursue cost savings to help maintain structural profitability and future innovation plans.","Finally, the Baby and Family Care segment increased organic sales by 6%. Volume and mix were flat and pricing contributed 6%. Global Baby Care delivered strong results, with value share up nearly 1 point as we leveraged the strong portfolio we have established. Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa grew value share by nearly 1.5 points by focusing on a strong 3-tiered portfolio, supported by equity building and commercial and product innovation.","Asia also had strong growth, with share increasing nearly 2 points. India Pampers shipments grew 50% behind a combination of market growth and the most significant product upgrade since we introduced the brand in 2007. In developed markets, North America volume declined modestly due to a contracting market. However, U.S. value share grew over 1.5 points, led by the premium tier.","Overall, our large businesses delivered solid results in a tough environment. We're taking the necessary steps in developed markets to restore growth in categories where consumer value issues or portfolio gaps have led to market share decline. Our progress in developing markets is offsetting these issues. While this creates a near-term mix headwind on the top and bottom line, the scale we're building in developing markets, through innovation driven growth and category expansions, will help improve the profitability over time.","I will now turn the call back to Jon.","Jon R. Moeller","Thanks, Teri. Before I get into guidance, I want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing and the environment that we're operating in. As you saw in our press release, we've tightened our fiscal year sales guidance and reduced our earnings per share guidance. Foreign exchange has been a strong headwind. When we set our initial guidance for the year, we expected foreign exchange to add 2% to 3% to top line growth. This range has declined by 3 to 4 percentage points, which equates to roughly $3 billion in sales or a negative earnings impact of $0.15 to $0.18 per share.","Since the beginning of the year, the ruble, the zloty, the real, the peso and the Turkish lira have all moved significantly, depreciating between 10% and 20% against the dollar. These currencies, along with the pound, account for the vast majority of the earnings impact since our initial guidance for the year.","Historically, when foreign exchange rates have moved significantly in a negative direction, we have received a meaningful offset from declining commodity costs. This has not been the case this year. Across our total basket of material and energy exposures, we've seen little change to our going-in expectations of $1.8 billion, before tax, of higher input costs. We have seen prices soften for some commodities, like pulp and natural gas, but these benefits have been largely offset by increases in other materials, such as surfactants, alcohols and other chemicals, and direct costs such as diesel fuel.","The overall economic environment in developed markets is weak. On a unit basis, market growth has decelerated over the past 12-, 6- and 3-month periods in both Western Europe and the U.S. With Europe now -- Europe is now likely in recession, growth in Japan is negative and GDP in the U.S. is growing but slowly.","A related dynamic that's having an impact is the disproportionate growth coming from developing markets. While after-tax margin levels for our developing markets are only modestly lower than the developed average, the absolute profit per unit is lower. The resulting mix impact on profit per unit is contributing to our revised outlook.","We're also facing some market-specific impacts, including government pricing interventions being made in Venezuela. Because of the uncertainty leading up to an eventual announcement, some retailers have stopped ordering for fear that they will end up with inventory that costs more than the price the new laws may allow them to sell those inventories at. We've also had to pull out of Syria following the tightening of U.S. sanctions, and we continue to monitor developments in other Middle Eastern and North African countries.","As we've seen these dynamics unfolding, we considered a number of actions that could have helped us maintain our prior guidance range. For example, we could have delayed Oral-B toothpaste expansions in Latin America, we could have cut advertising aimed at building consumer awareness of Tide PODS this quarter, we could have significantly reduced our marketing and in-store investments behind the Olympics, or we could have delayed important R&D investments.","However, as we've said many times, we're going to balance our objective of making meaningful near-term improvement and operating profit growth with our objective of maintaining the investments necessary to sustain growth beyond just the next few quarters.","That doesn't mean we're standing still. To help manage the dynamics I've just discussed and to ensure we can meaningfully grow operating profit, we're strengthening our commitment to the 4 priorities we set for the organization at the beginning of this year:","Our first priority is maintaining our top line growth momentum. Overall, we're pleased with our results here. Against the backdrop of a weak macroeconomic environment in developed markets, we have averaged 4% organic sales growth over the last 9 quarters. As we look forward, we expect continued growth with developing markets like Latin America and Asia leading the way, offsetting lackluster growth in developed markets.","Our second priority is to execute our pricing changes with excellence. We're also pleased with our progress in this area. Overall, we've implemented about 80% of the pricing we expect to take this fiscal year. There are still several new businesses and markets in which we'll be taking price increases to offset higher input costs or foreign exchange impacts. Also as I mentioned earlier, there are a few categories where we will be making some corrective adjustments, but these adjustments will have a minor impact compared to the $3.5 billion of increases we will take this year. Pricing will continue to be a significant driver of organic sales growth for the next several quarters.","Our third priority is improving productivity in all that we do. Our productivity and restructuring work are focused on 3 main objectives: ensuring we have the right resources in place -- excuse me, the right resources in the right places; increasing our agility and speed to market; and driving cost savings. We're taking an aggressive design-based approach to drive productivity improvement. This approach is necessary to get resources in the right places and increase our agility.","Several recent decisions we made flow directly from this design work. We are reducing the number of technical centers we operate globally and are opening new technical centers in developing markets, such as the new facility we're building in Singapore and the expansion of our R&D center in Beijing. These steps expand the number of technical resources operating closer to the sources of growth in our industry.","We're consolidating our supply-planning activities into central hubs, including one we opened earlier this year in Cincinnati. We just announced an outsourcing arrangement for U.S. in-store detailing work to several partners who are experts in this area. These efforts will improve speed and agility, improve supply chain efficiency and ensure our brands continue to have excellent presentation during promotions and on shelf while reducing costs.","We're examining all areas of costs in every business, including product design, manufacturing, logistics and marketing spending. We're also reducing travel costs by leveraging technology and conducting more virtual meetings as we coordinate work across regions of the world.","One of the largest opportunities to better leverage our scale and drive simplification is in the overhead organizations that account for slightly more than 40% of company-wide enrollment. Our organization design work has identified the opportunity to reduce enrollment in these areas by about 3% or 1,600 roles by the end of this fiscal year. We'll achieve this objective through the combination of selective hiring, normal attrition and our restructuring efforts. The reductions this year should yield annual savings of around $240 million before tax.","Our efforts to reduce costs in nonmanufacturing portions of the organization will go beyond this fiscal year. We'll share more specifics on the overall scope of the productivity improvements and resulting savings at the CAGNY conference in 3 weeks.","We're committed to work to get the right resources in the right places, improve our agility and speed, and deliver meaningful cost savings. This savings work will be -- will deliver the fuel for reinvestment and innovation and portfolio expansion, and it will be an important driver of high-quality earnings growth.","The first 3 priorities focus on top line growth and productivity improvement, leading directly to our fourth priority, which has been to restore solid operating profit growth. As a result of the pricing we've taken, as a result of easing commodity cost comparisons and as a result of our productivity and cost-savings effort, we expect second half core operating profit growth of 10% to 15%.","Let me now turn to guidance. On the fiscal year, we're tightening our organic sales guidance range to growth of 4% to 5% versus our prior range of 3% to 6%. This tighter range reflects the fact that we're halfway through the fiscal year. We estimate the net impact from pricing and mix will contribute between 2 to 3 points to sales growth for the year. Within this, we expect pricing and lower promotion levels will add roughly 4% to sales growth and that mix will continue to be a headwind of 1 to 2 percentage points. We expect foreign exchange will be a negative 1% to sales growth for the year based on current rates. This brings our all-in sales growth guidance to a range of 3% to 4% for the year.","On the bottom line, we're adjusting our guidance range for core earnings per share to $4 to $4.10 versus our prior range of $4.15 to $4.33. Our new range equates to core EPS growth of 1% to 4% versus prior year core earnings per share of $3.95.","We're maintaining a relatively wide core earnings per share guidance range due to several uncertainties including underlying market growth rates, input costs and foreign exchange impacts. This range does not include a potential impact from the Venezuelan review of industry pricing levels, as it's still very unclear what degree of effect this may have on our results.","We now expect all-in earnings per share in the range of $3.85 to $4.08. This range includes the expected gain from the Pringles divestiture of $0.55 to $0.65 per share, as we're maintaining estimates on the assumption we will close the transaction within this fiscal year. All-in earnings per share also includes noncore restructuring cost in the range of $0.15 to $0.80 per share and the $0.52 per share of noncore charges for the impairments and the legal item in France.","We continue to expect capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of net sales, which may result in free cash flow productivity somewhat below our typical 90% target level.","Our plans to utilize our free cash flow remain unchanged. We expect to pay around $6 billion in dividends and we estimate share repurchases will be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion for the fiscal year, a modest reduction in the range, consistent with our new earnings outlook.","For the second half of the fiscal year, we expect significant improvement in operating profit and operating margin, though we're now planning for a more gradual improvement than we predicted earlier this year because of the macro factors I talked about earlier.","On the top line, we expect organic sales growth in the range of 4% and 5% for the second half. We're forecasting strong growth in developing markets, driven by our innovation and expansion plans. We're continue -- we're continuing, as we've talked, to globalize our Oral Care business with new launches in Latin America. We're investing to expand distribution to more stores in developing markets and improving the quality of that distribution. We have a major Bounty initiative launching in February and we remain very excited about Tide PODS, which will be available nationally in 3 weeks.","We also recently kicked off the first elements of our global marketing and in-store plans for the Olympics, and you'll see more and more multi-brand advertising and promotional activities as we get closer to the summer games in London. Our objective for the Olympics is to generate $500 million in incremental sales.","Finally as I mentioned, pricing will continue to be a significant contributor to sales growth in both developed and developing markets.","On the bottom line, our new guidance translates to back half core EPS growth of 4% to 9%. This includes roughly a 600 basis point earnings per share growth rate headwind from the difficult tax comparison. At an equalized tax rate, core earnings per share growth would be in the range of 10% to 15% in the back half.","As I mentioned, operating profit growth is also expected to be in the 10% to 15% range, which translates to core operating margin growth of 150 to 250 basis points for the second half. The primary driver of the improvement is the combined benefit of higher year-on-year pricing and much more favorable commodity cost comparisons. For perspective, we expect year-on-year gross margin to swing from a significant negative in the first half to a significant year-on-year positive in the fourth quarter. Also, the benefits from our productivity and cost savings work will accelerate in the second half.","Moving to the January-March quarter, we're expecting organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%. We expect a continued strong benefit from pricing in the March quarter, similar to what we delivered in the December quarter. Foreign exchange is expected to reduce sales growth by approximately 3 points, which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of flat to up 2%.","On the bottom line, we expect to deliver a meaningful improvement in operating profit and operating margin despite lower gross margin and a negative impact from foreign exchange. The year-on-year commodity costs challenge will begin to dissipate in the March quarter. To be clear, input cost will still be up in the third quarter, but we're beginning to catch up to the high base period levels. This dynamic, along with the recent pricing we've taken and our ongoing cost savings efforts, will help reduce the pressure on gross margin.","Solid operating profit, essentially, will be fully offset by a difficult tax rate comparison. The effective tax rate in the March quarter of last year was 21.1% and we expect the comparable rate to be between 500 and 600 basis points higher this year. This equates to roughly a 7% headwind on earnings per share growth for the quarter or about $0.07 per share.","We expect March quarter core earnings per share in the range of $0.91 to $0.97 or down 5% to up 1%, versus base period core earnings per share of $0.96. At an equalized tax rate, this equates to core earnings per share growth in the range of 2% to 8%. On an all-in basis, we estimate earnings per share in the range of $0.81 to $0.87. This includes expected noncore restructuring charges of approximately $0.10 per share for the quarter as we expand the implementation of our organization design work.","In summary, we're making progress in a difficult economic and competitive environment. We expect sequential improvement in operating profit growth from the second to third quarters. We'll see an even larger improvement as we move from the third to fourth quarters behind the easing of input cost comparisons and the full benefit of pricing. We are continuing to make the investments necessary to deliver our long-term growth objectives while also increasing the urgency to deliver near-term improvements in our cost structure.","That concludes our prepared remarks, and now Bob, Teri and I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Jon, in terms of looking at this, this is the second year in a row where you guys have sort of back end loaded the year and then had to sort of take a step back and sort of reduce some of the profit growth estimates. And I understand it's a volatile market out there. But can you talk a little bit about how you're viewing the role of productivity going forward in terms of maybe sort of minimizing some of these shocks? And I guess, are there any lessons learned from this as we look out in terms of sort of your ability to sustain, let's say, a certain growth rate? Or do you think it's just more of the macro environment?","Jon R. Moeller","The link between heightened efforts on productivity and the desire to be able to deal with the kind of volatility that we're managing through is the right link to draw. We are -- we're going to stay focused on this. We think there's significant savings to come from this. Again, we'll talk more in detail about that at CAGNY. And that should give us the ability to deal more effectively with the volatility that we're experiencing. In terms of predicable growth rates, I think we've grown very productively on the top line. The bottom line really, as you indicate, has been a function of macro effects, whether it was commodities last year, the combination of commodities and foreign exchange this year. We'll work hard to offset them through increased productivity, but what we can't do is reduce spending to offset these costs in a way that harms the long-term trajectory of the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to get some thoughts. The guidance reduction seems heavily obviously FX related, but I'm kind of haunted by the last time you guys took a lot of pricing and the competitors either didn't follow or you took too much, and it kind of had to come in reverse several quarters later. So can you just talk about that dynamic and how much flexibility you have to deal with that, just in case you need to close price gaps more broadly?","Robert A. McDonald","Nik, we talked about the fact we've taken about $3.5 billion of pricing and that there were 3 category\/country combinations where competition didn't follow and we felt the need to react to that to regain the value equation. And in Jon remark -- Jon's remarks, we talked about those reversals or reactions not being material to the $3.5-billion increment. And so that's what we've seen so far. So I think you'd have to say that, overall, we were successful in executing the pricing that we wanted and we feel good about what we were able to achieve. Having said that, there are these 3 instances where we've had to take some action to return the value equation.","Jon R. Moeller","I'll just add 2 things. One is that the -- while it's a significant amount of pricing, the percentage increase that we're talking about this time around is much less than occurred last time. So the pricing gaps as they open are nowhere near as significant. The second important difference between this cycle and last cycle, if you recall, as soon as we got prices up, commodities started to roll over. That's not what we're seeing now. So in terms of both kind of the macro dynamics and in terms of what we're seeing in the marketplace, we feel like we're in reasonably good shape.","Robert A. McDonald","Yes, I think -- the only other thing I would add is, as Jon said, we're growing share now. Our in-line share was about 45% of our business. Back in AMJ of 2009, that number was more like 25% of our business. So we've been able to continue to hold the market share. Certainly, we'd like to be up to 60%, which is what we hold ourselves to. But 45% is not bad, given that we've always said that the October-December quarter would be the most volatile and would be the most difficult during this fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just -- I guess, developed category volume continues to be weak, right? You guys are clear about that and not really getting better. And obviously, emerging markets have helped. But in the context of developed markets' weakness, can I -- just can you talk a little bit about what the top line growth composition might look like in the long term? Just specifically, absent volume growth. And can you use pricing as a tool in a more proactive way than you have? Or does a weak economic environment and competition really make that unrealistic? I guess, can you break out what you think pricing versus volume will look like, avoiding even giving an absolute range? Just what do you think the composition of that top line could look like as we go 3 to 5 years out?","Robert A. McDonald","Well, we're going to continue to grow the top line and we're going to continue to grow the market share, Chris. I mean, as you know, our top line goal is to grow 1 to 2 points above the market. And the antidote, the way to do that is to have a full portfolio of offerings from premium priced to low priced. I think our laundry category in the U.S. is somewhat instructive of this, where we've got Tide TOTAL CARE, the best aggregation of technology you can get in the laundry category at a price index of about 160 versus average Tide, all the way down to Era, which can be anywhere from an index of 65 to 85. And we're innovating on that business by introducing PODS and doing a number of other things on other brands. So for us, we want to grow 1 to 2 points above the market. We want to do that with a full portfolio and there's indication that -- there's certainly indication, for example, on Crest 3D White is a good example, that even though you're premium priced, if you're offering a superior value to consumers, they will continue to buy it. So innovation becomes very critical to the future.","Jon R. Moeller","I think if you think about a more normalized environment, remember the volumes are being impacted by a significant amount of pricing. I'd see volume as a bigger contributor going forward than it has been certainly in the last quarter, call it 2 to 4 points. And I think there is some inherent pricing power in many of our businesses and we're going to be working on more routine discipline in terms of pricing, so hopefully that'll continue to contribute positively going forward. And then we're going to continue to have some mixed drag just from the disproportionate growth in developing markets. So I think, if you go back to our historic range of 4 to 6, or call it 4 to 5 top line, a good 3 to 4 points of that will be volume on a going basis and then we'd have some mix and pricing help. And that's of course a global number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on the, I guess, commentary, that you said some of the -- you saw some of the price gaps starting to narrow and the expectation that this is somewhat temporary because -- I couldn't help it. I went in the press release and I counted and 7 times you guys mentioned competitive activity or value differences. And that, combined with the mid-single-digit volume decline in the U.S., it just feels like a pretty significant expectation of things getting better pretty quickly and then again with the 45% of businesses holding or maintaining share. So can you just give me a few more examples on like what really changes sequentially? Or are you -- where are you already seeing things getting better from a competitive standpoint that can make you comfortable with that outlook?","Robert A. McDonald","Well, I think, Lauren, as I said earlier, the fact that we've taken so much pricing, $3.5 billion, and that we've got these very isolated discrete instances where competitors haven't followed price increases -- maybe if I get granular on those, it will show you how the balance seems to be going well. In some -- in most of the markets, competitors are raising prices. Certainly, pricing is at the discretion of retailers, but in others they haven't. So in the U.K., for example, we've continued to see deep discounting from Unilever on both the hair care and laundry categories. In U.K. laundry -- and remember, we came from behind in the U.K. in laundry. U.K. is Unilever's home market. We were up to 55 plus share. Unilever's average retail price is now down about 5% over the past 6 months, where our average price is up about 4%. In U.S. auto dish category, Reckitt's not increased prices, and again we're the market leader. In fact, they've increased their trade spending in track channels by more than 40% versus the prior year since we increased prices in June of 2011. In U.S. laundry, our average Tide powder pricing is up double digits versus year ago, while Church & Dwight's average powder pricing is down low single digits. On liquids, we continue to see heavy promotional activity from competitors, while the average Tide Liquid pricing is flat versus year ago. While we can't discuss unannounced plans on particular brands, we're closely monitoring these situations and we're going to react. In fact, we've already announced, as Jon said in his remarks, a price increase rollback on Cascade in North America to deal with the situation on Reckitt. And we have plans moving forward on the other disparities I discussed.","Jon R. Moeller","And if you think about the timing of when we've taken pricing, Lauren, a lot of this occurred September-October window, and we've talked before about needing really 6 months to understand how it's going to sort out. We've seen a number of competitors, and I won't name country\/categories, recently take pricing, so that gives us encouragement going forward. I think if you listen to the remarks of both Colgate and Kimberly, which you obviously have, they continue to -- those remarks are indicative of an environment that requires pricing. And we've actually had some competitors, Energizer as an example, take another round of price increases, which we're now following. So it's -- I mean, it would take me a long time to take you through obviously category by country across the world, but we are seeing positive development in the last month or 2, which does give us confidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You're kind of blaming the categories in the U.S., but it's a little bit frustrating because your market shares are so high and the old P&G would have sort of committed itself to expanding the categories, and I know it's a different environment partially, but what do you think the issues are, the challenges in actually driving category growth through real discontinuous innovation, because it doesn't seem like we've seen a lot of that recently?","Robert A. McDonald","Well, Bill, I agree with you that discontinuous innovation is important to grow categories in developed markets. I would argue with you in a bit that we -- that you're not seeing it. In fact, we just announced the launch of Febreze auto product, which gets us into a category in fragrances in automobiles that we've never been in before. And this product takes advantage of our proprietary superior technology in fragrance that I think will be a big hit and will remake the category, so we're really excited about that. But certainly, we have dedicated more resources to discontinuous innovation because we recognize the importance of that. Of course, Tide PODS is another example where we're in the midst of the introduction of Tide PODS, which will be expansive to the laundry category in the sense that it's priced higher in a per-use basis as well as it's the most condensed laundry product you can buy. So it's going to be much better for the environment. And as we said earlier, we expect it to be about 30% of the category. But we're working on more innovation as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital Markets.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm having a really hard time reconciling the $0.15 to $0.18 hit from FX. The -- when the fiscal year started, you were looking for 2% to 3% positive and in the last quarter you went to neutral without changing the outlook. Now, it's down 1% for the year and it's $0.15 to $0.18. Somehow it doesn't make sense. I'm wondering if you can give us the breakdown between the transaction and translation impact, because a lot of us have been adjusting for FX as rates have changed and a change of this magnitude is just not gelling, so some help there would be appreciated.","Jon R. Moeller","Sure. The dynamic that you described, which is having reflected, if you will, a significant amount of the FX decline in our top line estimates in our last call, is correct. At that point, we felt that there were things that were going to able us -- enable us to offset the bottom line impact of FX, so we didn't adjust our bottom line guidance at that point. But for instance, in the last quarter, as has been alluded to by others, we had much more growth in developing markets as a percentage of our total than we were expecting, which is positive on one hand but has a negative P&L impact. We also had assumed, as I alluded to in my remarks, that with those -- with that stronger dollar, we would see some rollover in commodity costs and that turned out not to materialize. And that's the reason we're now reducing guidelines, so obviously -- or guidance. So obviously, there's a lot of moving parts, but at the heart of issue is FX. And to help you get to the $0.15 to $0.18, which I realize can be hard, I'd suggest we follow up offline and we can take you through that in broad strokes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","One just quick clarifying and then the real question, but can you give us a sense of advertising spend on the quarter given your SG&A change? And then real question is, we understand the macro backdrop and we've heard it from many people, but I guess it's a little -- I don't know what the right word is, frustrating, bothersome maybe, but it seems that there's things that P&G itself could do better as well. So like Tide PODS is one of maybe 9 supply chain issues. The volume and market share elasticity maybe were underestimated a little bit. Cost cutting is improving. But you know we'd like you guys to do it faster and it's great news that we're going to hear more, it sounds like, at CAGNY. Is that a fair assessment, that there are many things P&G could do more, could do better in terms of kind of self-help? And if that's the case, we scratch our heads sometimes and say, okay, so why? And one response that comes up a lot when we talk to clients is, \"Gosh, it's just too complex for the business.\" And there's some support for that belief as Beauty and non-Beauty are diverging in terms of growth as Colgate and Church & Dwight and Kimberly-Clark are more focused or arguably even better. What do you think about that argument, that it's just too complex to manage P&G as is and it'll be better managed broken up?","Robert A. McDonald","Well, obviously, we think there's tremendous advantage to having the scale that we have, and we've said repeatedly that we've got to demonstrate to you that we can take that scale and turn it into accelerated growth. Our goal is to be in the top third of our peer group in terms of total shareholder return and anything that detracts from us being there is unacceptable to us. We're the company who was just rated by Chief Executive Magazine, through some research they did, as being the best company for the development of leaders, and it's now time for all of us as leaders of this company to step up, get the company back into the top third of our peer group and stay there in terms of total shareholder return. And we're in the process of building the capability to do that. Improving the productivity is going to be part of it, to give us possibility when these kinds of short-term impacts occur, continuing to innovate, continuing to build brands. But I think you're going to continue -- I think you're going to see some good evidence. We're going to obviously talk about it at CAGNY. But in the balance of the year, I think you'll see good evidence that we're on track to achieve those goals I just talked about, and we will point them out to you along the way so that you don't miss them.","Jon R. Moeller","And we're all for appropriate portfolio discipline and ensuring that each part of the portfolio's value gets maximized. I've gotten asked, similar to your question many times recently, would we consider doing something like Kraft? I would argue that's exactly what we've been doing as major portions of our business, whether it's pharmaceuticals or coffee and now snacks, lead the portfolio.","Robert A. McDonald","The question is, can a company with a scale like ours win versus the more focused company that you talked about, and we will help you see evidence of that along the way. But I think the fact that we're making good progress in Oral Care and we, as Jon said in his remarks, I think, and Teri said in hers, we're expanding our Oral Care offerings to the balance of Latin America, you're going to see further evidence of this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, a detail question. Jon, what's your tax rate expectation for the full year? I'm not sure if I missed that. And what's your expectation on an ongoing basis beyond this year? And then, Bob, I just wanted to get an update on your viewpoint of attention between gaining market share and driving profitability going forward. We saw a pretty pronounced focus on market share if you go back a year, 1.5 years ago and that shifted here the last couple of quarters to more of a profit focus with the higher pricing, but now it looks like you're losing some of the market share momentum you had. So I just want to get an update over the next few quarters here, if you're willing to cede little bit of market share and you're not too concerned by the share loss given you led pricing, or if you anticipate taking more aggressive actions beyond the selective adjustments you outlined today.","Jon R. Moeller","So first, Dara, on the tax rate. The range for this year is, call it, 25% to 26%. And of course, the going rate is one of the biggest questions we have right now. It's a policy-based question, but assuming status quo, we'd expect a rate of around 26% on a going basis.","Robert A. McDonald","Our leaders are rewarded for building both market share and profit. The overarching goal is, as I said, is to be in the top third of our peer group in total shareholder return. We talk about and in our leadership, not or. At the time where you -- I think you and others interpreted what I was saying as being a focus on share. That was after the AMJ quarter of 2009 and A.G. and I reported that our market share was growing or in line in about 25% of our business, so it was critical at that time to regain our market share. We had gone through a period of, as Jon said earlier, tremendous pricing and we had lost quite a bit of market share. We had to regain that. Today's situation is very different. As Jon indicated earlier, we're in line or growing market share of about 45% of our business. We know where the issues are. We're working on those issues. But our job going forward is to improve the profitability of the company and to grow market share at the same time and to be in the top third of our peer group in total shareholder return, and we're not going to stop until we're there and we're even not going to stop once we are there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I wanted just to focus more on the savings side. My understanding is that the pretax savings is going to be $250 million and this is all related to Pringles, if I understand correctly. But given that there is this margin dilution from an emerging market that is now going to go away, and you commented also that the growth profile in the U.S. and Western Europe is surprising on the low side, and I understand that there is a significant cyclical aspect to it. But shouldn't you be more proactive thinking about resizing the SG&A side and basically try to be more aggressive on the savings side, because $250 million in a company that is well over $80 billion in sales seems to be rather modest?","Jon R. Moeller","So first, just a clarification. The $250 million savings is not related to Pringles. It's related to enrollment -- a non-Pringles enrollment reduction that we're targeting this year of 3%. Second, we agree with you that we need to be even more intentional in this area, and as we said, we're going to talk about that a little bit more when we're together in 3 weeks at CAGNY. But what one thing I want to also talk about is the developing market dynamic. If you look at the last 10 years, we've grown -- we've tripled the size of our developing market business. And over the last 6 years, we have had to deal with about 650 basis points of commodity cost increases, over $6 billion. And over that same period of time, while we're growing our business disproportionately in developing markets and while we're dealing with these commodity costs, we increased our operating margin 200 basis points. I realize the last couple of quarters haven't looked like that. But I think that's more indicative over longer periods of time, as you smooth out the volatility, of the kind of performance that we're capable of delivering and we'll target to deliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess just following up with the cost cutting and understanding that you'll talk more about, I guess that 350 to 450 basis point at CAGNY. I guess the question is the use of the cost savings and the role of advertising. I think you've said before that where you ended 2011, I think, it was a little over 11%. It was probably a good level. But just given some of the softer trends we're seeing in developed markets and obviously trying to find the balance between share gain and driving profitability, do you think that you're going to need to see a bigger step-up maybe over the next couple of years as that plays out in order to kind of reengage consumers back in some of the premium categories that maybe you haven't seen over the last year?","Robert A. McDonald","Thank you, Jason. As we've said historically, the 9% to 11% range has been what we have spent. Actually, I believe that over time, we will see the increase in the cost of advertising moderate. There are just so many different media available today and we're quickly moving more and more of our businesses into digital. And in that space, there are lots of different avenues available. In the digital space, with things like Facebook and Google and others, we find that the return on investment of the advertising, when properly designed, when the big idea is there, can be much more efficient. One example is our Old Spice campaign, where we had 1.8 billion free impressions and there are many other examples I can cite from all over the world. So while there may be pressure on advertising, particularly in the United States, for example, during the year of a presidential election, there are mitigating factors like the plethora of media available.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the Pringles business. Obviously, you kept in the divestiture -- or the gain from the divestiture by fiscal year end. Just any color you can give us in terms of, with an SEC investigation, how you're confident this can happen in the next 3, 4 months.","Jon R. Moeller","Well, it all depends on what's determined, first in the internal investigation and then others that may be occurring. And we're just, at this point, following Diamond's public representations that they're going to have concluded the internal investigation in the middle of February, and we'll obviously be able to talk with them in more detail about that at that time. And then we'll go from there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I have a housekeeping question and my real question. You broke out volume for developers -- the developing parts of the world. Could you break out pricing? And also, could you tell us if volume is down more or less in the U.S. than in Europe? And then my real question is back to this -- to innovation, which you seem to agree is critical to doing well over time. When are we going to start seeing more large-scale innovation in developed regions so that you can start gaining share? And as an example, you cite Fusion as gaining share, which is great, but overall you're losing a share in blades. And I think we heard 9 months ago that you're going to start supporting some of your legacy brands, but now I'm hearing that you're just now beginning to talk to retailers about how to support value. I'm just -- you seem slow to innovate and I'm wondering if you're going to step it up.","Jon R. Moeller","So first, Alice, let me just handle the housekeeping, and then I'll turn it over to Bob. We can help you with that information. We will help you with that information. I don't have it here with me at that level of granularity. But if you call Jon after the meeting, we'll help you out there.","Robert A. McDonald","Alice, if you look over -- since the year 2000 and you look at the number of IRI Pacesetters, those have been the biggest sellers in the categories in which we compete. Half of them, since the year 2000, have been Procter & Gamble's. We expect to keep that kind of pace of innovation up and that's the way we look at it. This year, we've introduced Downy Unstopables, which created a new category. We've introduced Olay Facial Hair, which created a new category. We're just now introducing ProGlide Styler, which created a new category. I talked about the fact we're going into automobiles with Febreze for the first time. We've got a couple of other new category creators later this fiscal year. And then as I look at our program going forward, we have other discontinuous innovation as well. But discontinuous innovation is something we're working very hard on and we recognize that there's obviously a correlation between our North American business and discontinuous innovation. You talked about blades and razors. If you look at the way we've grown our business in Latin America and in Asia on blades and razors, it will be instructive to the growth that we will have in Western Europe and North America, because we have historically supported all forms of our blades and razor offering in Latin America, for example, and that business is one of our strongest, if not our strongest, globally. It's growing share and all forms are growing. And that's what you'll have happen here. I don't think that we started this 9 months ago, but certainly we're moving very quickly to do it. And you're right. A lot of the business, the share that we've grown on Fusion, we've lost on Mach3, and that's why we need to support Mach3 and we've got some significant innovations coming on Mach3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just to go back to the sort of the broader issue, and again, it sounds like you are going to address this at CAGNY, but as it relates to the balance, I think, in what has long been somewhat focused on of your SG&A spending relative to your peers, is the balance between ongoing restructuring and developing market investments. And thank you again for the clarity of the pointing out that, that's grown from 27%, now to 45% of your sales. Can you talk about how much is on the developing market investments, how much you're spending there? And then a timetable or path to where you see those hitting the inflection points to start to positively more contribute to operating profit growth?","Jon R. Moeller","First, just a clarification. The 45% is a volume metric. From a sales standpoint, we expect by the end of the year to have 37% of our business in developing markets. And I think we don't have the detail you're looking for here with us right now, but this is something I think we can also talk a bit more about at CAGNY in a couple of weeks, in terms of what the investment and inflection paths would look like in general in developing markets.","Robert A. McDonald","Your -- the spirit of your question, Tim, is true, that while we -- Jon did talk about the fact that we're reducing enrollment by 3%, overhead enrollment by 3% or 3 percentage points this fiscal year, that at the same time we are shifting the footprint of the company to take advantage of the growth where the growth occurs. Examples of that, Jon mentioned the fact that we've closed technical centers in Western Europe, North America. We've expanded -- doubled the size of our technical center in Beijing. We broke ground on a new technical center in Singapore. Of the roughly 19 plants we have under construction over the last 6 months, one was in the United States. It's our Box Elder, Utah paper facility. But the others have all been in developing markets. So while it may look somewhat more static from an overall standpoint, underneath those numbers is quite a dramatic shift in the resourcing of the company to the areas of growth. And that's one of the reasons, for example, our Baby Care business is so strong today. Roughly 40% of the babies are being born in Asia. I think if you add the Middle East and Africa and maybe parts of Latin America that, you'd be up to 70%. And that's why our Baby Care business is strong despite the fact that the number of births in the United States is declining.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Curious the thought process on what makes you reconsider current pricing and promotional actions, particularly given slowing share gains. And then sort of related to that, curious about the last 20% of pricing you have not taken. Are you planning to take it? What categories is it in? Have you already taken pricing in some of those categories? Or is it in categories that you've held off on? So just a bit more color there, too, would be helpful.","Jon R. Moeller","In terms of the future pricing, obviously, we can't comment category specificity. What I would tell you is that some of it is related to the currency devaluations that we've talked about in developing markets, so it's catching up with that. But there is also pricing in the developed world, both in categories where we've already priced and in some where we're still -- that's still ahead of us. So I really can't get into anything more specific than that.","Robert A. McDonald","Mark, I'm not sure I totally understood your first question. But one of the things we do is that after we announce pricing and we take pricing, we obviously watch to see if competitor prices. And if they run a buy 1, get 1 free instead of pricing, that suggests to us that they're not going to price, and we wait to watch their reaction over time and when they don't react, then we react to resume the value equation we had when we were growing share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser of Caris & Company.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just another question on innovation and how you think about it. Are kind of all categories kind of equally deserving of innovation? Or how much do you think about the inherent growth rate of categories in terms of demographics or birth rates or whatever in terms of looking at where you want to put your investment? Or is it that inherently declining categories like diapers in developed markets might actually need more investment, because you need to work at some kind of innovation that could enhance category size or something? Can you just talk about how you think about it in terms of the return on investment?","Robert A. McDonald","Sure. Renovation is our lifeblood, Linda. I mean our purpose is to improve people's lives and the primary way we do that is through innovation. We spend over $2 billion a year on research and development. That's about double our next largest competitor. And we spend about $0.5 billion a year on consumer research, which obviously tells us where to innovate. We then look at our innovation spending and resource allocation by category. We look at it by category relative to the sales of that category and we look at it relative to what -- where competitors are spending. And we look to get a rate of return higher than our competitors because of our scale, because we're able to identify technologies that become platform technologies across categories, and this is a little bit back to Ali's question of why you should expect more from us. For example, our knowledge of bleach and laundry led to Crest Whitestrips, which leads to our competitive advantage in hair color in Perfect 10, which leads to other uses of bleach across our portfolio. So those platforms become very critical to us to being able to get more for the $2 billion in R&D spending than our competition, which may be more singularly focused on an individual category. Secondly, back in 2000, when A.G. was our CEO, we announced a program called Connect + Develop, where we want to get 50% of our ideas from outside the company. We've been successful in doing that. In fact, today, about -- over 80% of our innovations have some kind of external partner. We even have joint development laboratories with our suppliers and we spend a lot of time working with outside universities, suppliers, partners in order to improve our rate of innovation as well as the impact of our innovation. We're one of the few companies in the world that has an Innovation & Technology Committee of our Board of Directors. We meet with that committee frequently. And we lay out our innovation program because it's so -- is so critical to our company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections. Additionally, the Company has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. John Chevalier joins me her. We\u2019re going to keep prepared remarks brief, reflecting a fairly straight forward quarter and Investor Day right around the corner. I\u2019ll provide headlines on the quarter\u2019s results, just a few comments on strategic focus areas and update fiscal year guidance before turning the call to your questions.","We continue enabled by superiority periodicity, and creating a more focused, agile and accountable organization and culture to make important progress towards our objective of delivering balanced growth, top line, bottom line and cash. We\u2019re accelerating organic sales growth driven by strong volume and consumption growth with market shares improving and now growing on an aggregate basis.","Organic sales grew 4% driven by strong organic volume growth of over 3%. Pricing was neutral to the quarter, with mix of positive 1 point impact to top line growth. 9 of 10 global categories grew organic sales. Skin and Personal Care grew in the teens, Personal Health Care double-digits, Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Family Care and Grooming each grew organic sales mid-single-digits.","All-channel consumption, very strong up in line with organic sale, and ahead of the underlying market, driving as I said, a return to aggregate market share growth. 33 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew value share, up from 26 last fiscal year, 23 the year before that and 17 in the year before that. So, reversing that progression 17, 23, 26, 33 of our category country combinations holding or growing value share. Similar progress in our largest market, the U.S. In September of 2016, one category growing share over the past 12 months; September of \u201817, 3 categories; currently, 8 categories. 40 basis points of share growth overall in Q1.","While making good sequential and absolute progress, we do continue to face several top-line challenges. We\u2019ve previously highlighted market level issues in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf markets, Iran, Algeria, Egypt and Nigeria. We have large businesses in the Middle East and Africa, nearly $3 billion in sales. Organic sales in the region were down nearly 10% for the quarter, about half-point drag on Company organic sales growth.","We had a very good quarter in Grooming with organic sales up 4%, but we\u2019re going to continue to face challenges on this business. As I said, we\u2019re making good progress, look at the U.S. for example. U.S. male blades and razors value share up from a 4-point decline in fiscal \u201817 to down 30 basis points in fiscal \u201818, to nearly a full-point increase over the last 6 months, which includes the impact of a major competitive launch during the period. We\u2019re growing all outlet volume share on a past 1, 3, 6 and 12-month basis. But, we are going to continue to face challenges from value share competition in store and online in several markets.","While we expect trends to improve, Baby Care sales were down for the quarter. We continue to build on the success of our diaper pant products. Pampers is a global share leader in pant style diapers with nearly a 30% share of the form, which is growing at a double digit rate. Taped diapers have been the soft spot, mainly in the mid value tiers. So, top-line challenges remain and improvement won\u2019t come in the form of a straight line, but consumption volume, sales and share are each progressing nicely.","Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $1.12, up 3% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was $260 million earnings headwind, about $0.10 a share. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share up 11%. This against the backdrop of significant commodity and transportation cost challenges, about an additional 5 points, net strong underlying earnings progress. Core gross margin contracted 150 basis points as 170 basis points of productivity improvement were offset by 100 points of commodity cost increases, 60 points of foreign exchange headwinds and 160 points from mix, innovation investments and other impacts.","Adjusting for currency and commodities, underlying gross margin was up slightly. Core SG&A costs decreased 80 basis points as a percentage of sales, down 150 basis points excluding FX impacts, driven by sales leverage and strong productivity improvement. As a result, core operating margin decreased 80 basis points including 250 basis points of productivity savings.","Constant currency core operating margin increased 50 basis points. Excluding currency and commodities, core operating margin was up 150 basis points.","Cash flow remains dependably strong with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 95%. We returned over $3.1 billion of cash to shareowners, nearly $1.3 billion in share repurchase and $1.9 billion of dividends.","In summary, a very strong quarter, solid consumption, volume and organic sales growth driving positive market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong constant currency core earnings per share growth and continued high levels of cash generated and returned to shareowners, all in the most dynamic and challenging environment we faced in a very long time.","We\u2019re accelerating change to meet these increasing challenges and to further improve results. As you know, we\u2019ve made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of products, packages, retail execution, marketing, and value, not just in the premium tier, but in each price tier where we compete, strengthening the long-term health and competitiveness of our brands.","We\u2019re making solid progress on extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of our execution, which shows in these results. Additional investment will be needed to continue this progress. The need for this investment, the need to offset macro cost headwinds and the need to drive balanced top and bottom line growth, including margin expansion underscores the importance of productivity.","We\u2019re driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business, approaching the midpoint of our second 5-year $10 billion productivity program. We\u2019ve consistently delivered $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion in annual cost of goods sold savings. We expect to be towards the high end of that range again this fiscal year. We\u2019re eliminating substantial waste in the media supply chain, delivering nearly $1 billion of savings and agency fees and ad production costs over the last 4 years. We see more savings potential in these areas along with more efficiency and media delivery.","We\u2019re continuing to drive savings and organization cost. Total enrollment now down nearly 30% since the start of our first productivity program, closer to 35%, when including contractor roles. We\u2019re focused on cost productivity and cash. We\u2019ve made significant progress in all areas of working capital. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve improved receivables by 3 days, inventory by 10 days, and payables by more than 30 days, enabling us to fund capital spending needed to transform our supply chain. Over the last seven fiscal years, we\u2019ve averaged nearly 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, returning an average of over 110% of reported net earnings to share owners through dividends and share repurchase. ","We\u2019re making needed organizational structure and culture changes to position us to win. We\u2019re taking steps to simplify the organization structure, clarify responsibility, increase accountability. We\u2019re supplementing internal talent with skilled, experienced, external hires, and approving category dedication and mastery. We\u2019re strengthening compensation and incentive programs, increasing the granularity of annual bonus awards, expanding participation in both the annual and three-year bonus programs, changing evaluation metrics to focus more on performance relative to competition and performance of local teams. We\u2019re increasing the amount of total compensation at risk and widening the payout range to deliver greater upside reward and downside consequence from over or under performance.","Each of these organization and culture changes are aimed at creating a company designed to win in today\u2019s market with today\u2019s consumer at the speed of the market, more agile, more accountable, more efficient, more productive. We\u2019re committed to lead constructive disruption in our industry across all areas of the value chain, innovation, supply systems, consumer communication and brand building, retail execution, sustainability. Constructive disruption will be the central theme of our discussion on Investor Day.","Moving to guidance. With one quarter of the year complete, we are maintaining organic sales growth guidance of 2% to 3%. Pricings return progressively more positive as we go through the year, but this will increase volume uncertainty and volatility. We now expect all-in sales growth in the range of down 2% to in line versus last year, reflecting 3 to 4 negative points of foreign exchange. We\u2019re maintaining core earnings per share guidance of 3% to 8%. Where we land in this range will be significantly impacted by FX, by commodity costs, by the competitive and consumer response to plan pricing and by our own productivity efforts. We\u2019re not currently at the high end of this range. In less than the three months since our last earnings release, the foreign exchange headwind on earnings increased by $400 million after tax, $900 million in total for the fiscal year. The Turkish lira devalued 25%, the Argentine peso more than 40%, the Indian rupee nearly 10%.","Commodity costs are expected to be $400 million headwind. Crude oil, a key feedstock for many raw materials is up more than 50% than this time last year. Trucking costs will likely be up 25% or more versus last year\u2019s insulated levels. Combined, FX and commodities are now $1.3 billion after tax or $0.50 per share headwind versus last fiscal. This excludes elevated transportation costs. As commodity prices and foreign exchange rates move, we will take pricing when the degree of cost impact warrants it and competitive realities allow it.","We\u2019ve already announced pricing in U.S. Baby Care and Family Care, we\u2019ve also informed retailers that we will increase prices on several products in Home Care, Oral Care and Personal Care, coupled with innovation launches early next calendar year. We\u2019ve announced pricing in several developing markets including Argentina, Turkey, and Russia to offset at least a portion of the FX impacts.","There will be volatility with these pricing moves. Competition may attempt to take advantage of our moves for short-term market share gains. Overall category consumption may be negatively impacted. We\u2019ll simply have to adjust as we go and as we learn. Importantly, excluding the macro impacts, every point of our core earnings per share guidance range reflects strong double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth. Our priority going forward will remain protecting superiority building, value accretive investments in the business. We won\u2019t allow short-term pressures to derail the progress we\u2019re making towards sustained, profitable top-line growth.","We continue to expect another year of 90% or better adjusted free cash flow productivity and another year of strong cash return to shareholders. We expect to pay over $7 billion in dividends and repurchase shares worth up to $5 billion. This, factors in the cash required to complete the acquisition of Merck\u2019s OTC business during the year and cash benefit and other deals.","Our guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within this guidance.","As you consider your quarterly estimates, keep in mind that pricing to offset FX and commodity pressures will begin to go into effect only later in Q2 and accelerate in the back half of the year. So, costs and FX challenges will persist and likely worsen as we move into Q2. While we expect to continue making progress on consumption and share, the top line organic sales comp in Q2 is more difficult than we faced in Q1, which will have an impact on reported growth rates.","To sum up, while the external environment presents many challenges, we\u2019re making important progress and are accelerating the pace of change. Efforts to extend our margin of competitive superiority, to drive productivity savings to fund investments for growth and enhance our industry-leading margins, to simplify our organization structure and increase accountability are and will continue driving improved results.","We\u2019re leading disruption across the value chain to consistently and sustainably grow sales, margins and cash. We\u2019ll talk more about all of these efforts at our Investor Day on November 8th, in Cincinnati. We\u2019ll also insure you have ample opportunity to interact with Company leadership. We hope you\u2019re able to join us, either in person or the webcast. I personally look forward to seeing and catching up with each of you.","With that, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey. Good morning. So, this the best organic sales growth you guys have had in five years, clearly it\u2019s probably better than you originally expected, and perhaps even early September at the conference circuit. But, at the same time, it\u2019s only one quarter, the comp was easier. You mentioned some caveat. So, just taking a step back at a high level, as you look at the underlying drivers behind this quarter\u2019s top line results, how confident are you that you\u2019ve regained some top line and market share momentum here and the drivers in the quarter and more sustainable and the combination of your efforts over the last few years as opposed to just specific to this quarter? And also, within that answer, the sequential progress you made in the quarter on the organic sales front. Can you talk about what geographies drove that and how much of that you think is more P&G market share improvement as opposed to improved category draw? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","All fair and good questions, though many. I feel very good -- we feel very good about the quality of the top line growth in the quarter and the quality of the number that we\u2019re reporting. We feel good about that for several reasons. As I mentioned, consumption is up in line with our top line progress, which is very encouraging. That\u2019s reflected in improvements in market share, which I talked about both in the U.S. and globally. The breadth of the growth is encouraging with 9 of 10 categories growing sales in the quarter. I mentioned some of the growth rates in our prepared remarks.","Importantly, also just the early read in October, roughly 55% of the way through that month, a month means even less than a quarter, but we haven\u2019t seen a drop off that you would expect to see in terms of shipments or consumption if the quality of the first quarter number was lacking. Also important is the growth in our largest market, largest and most profitable market, the U.S., where we were up 4% and volume growth of 5%. Also, the impact of pricing, both in the U.S. and broadly now neutral versus negative. So, all of that leads to our confidence in the numbers for the quarter and the results that we\u2019re seeing. There are though some things that are very important to note as we try to project that forward. One, we face very-strong competition, both multinational and local who are very active in the marketplace. Two, the pricing that we need to implement to offset commodity and foreign exchange cost is largely not in the marketplace today. There is very little that\u2019s actually on the shelf. As I mentioned, that will come into play later in Q2 and as we go through Q3 and Q4. And we know that that will introduce volume volatility and uncertainty.","So, we\u2019re happy with the numbers. I don\u2019t think there is anything that\u2019s suspect within those results, but we still have a lot of work to do as we go through the balance of the fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Thanks. Good morning. Following on that question, I mean, maybe we can turn a little bit to the emerging markets. Because clearly you saw the strong acceleration in organic sales, I imagine in emerging markets too, which sort of contracts with the fears in the market over GDP growth slowing and the impact of FX depreciation. So, can you walk through what you think drove the improvement in that particular area? Are you mixing up or -- upwards, have you started to take pricing in some cases where inflation has warranted it? And are there particular markets or categories that have surprised for the better, and what are doing to keep that momentum going? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Olivia. Against the backdrop of the broad question on the strength of emerging markets, as always, those markets are extraordinarily dynamic. I mentioned some of the challenges we\u2019re facing, for instance in the Middle East and Africa. And I would be not serving you well to overlook those. Having said that, the large developing markets where significant future growth should present itself, continue to perform fairly well, double-digit growth -- high-double digit growth in a market like India, Brazil doing well in the quarter. China, if you still consider that a developing market, up 7% the past 12 months, which is a significant acceleration from where we were at negative 5%, just two years ago. Encouragingly, that progress in those markets reflects the Company progress across the breadth of the portfolio. So, it\u2019s not just one category driving sales. I guess, the question quite frequently, what if we excluded SK-II and what impact would that have? There isn\u2019t a piece of our beauty business that isn\u2019t growing right now, most of it growing at very attractive rates. Several of our categories in China are growing at double-digit rates and a couple at high singles. So, I continue to believe that -- and this could change tomorrow, but as we said here today, the setup in developing markets is relatively strong, absent those markets with significant geopolitical disruption and absent the markets where we\u2019ve seen significant devaluation, and their pricing will be obviously required.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hey, guys. So, how should investors think about the profit pool of your whole HBC sector right now? So, pricing is not keeping up with inflation. And even going forward with incremental pricing, it sounds like you want to take -- you won\u2019t keep up with inflation. So, gross margins will be down. But gladly, for you guys, you have cut, [ph] you\u2019re doing well on productivity, you can deliver on the bottom line pretty well. But, how do you foresee that looking for kind of the HBC category overall, your competitors in terms of the profit pool? I guess, many of us are trying to figure out, if you\u2019re -- again, kind of this nicest [ph] house on a deteriorating HBC neighborhood, and would just love to hear your perspective on that.","Jon Moeller","As I think about it in aggregate, I\u2019m not in a terribly different position looking forward now than I would have been this time last year or this time three or four years ago. There\u2019s -- in terms of pricing relative to inflation, that\u2019s just beginning to be brought into the marketplace, not just by us, but you\u2019ve heard most of our competitors, both multinational and local, talk about the same thing. And that will work its way through the income statement as we go through the balance of the next calendar year and the end of this calendar year. I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to play out, but I don\u2019t have any definitive indication that it\u2019s going to play out negatively.","Innovation continues to be a significant source of margin and profit expansion within the industry. That is alive and well. And you see it in items like unit dose detergents, in fabric enhancer, beads, you see it in adult incontinence, you see it in some of the natural launches, pure, Pampers as an example. So, I continue to believe that that is a significant source and important source of both category growth for us and retailers, and margin opportunity for both us and our retail partners.","You mentioned productivity. There are additional tools available today to us and others that offer unprecedented opportunities in terms of automation and digitization to improve cost, both on the manufacturing floor and on the office floor. Tax rates for U.S. companies. Tax outlook is significantly better than it\u2019s ever been with lower rates than have been the case. We\u2019re seeing, and this is important, I think, modest increases in market growth rates, including and most importantly in the U.S. And that has a big impact on behavior, both across the manufacturing environment and the retail environment, as you would expect.","There are definitely headwinds. Interest rates are a headwind for U.S. borrowers. That differential in interest rates between the U.S. and other countries is leading as we all know to significant strengthening of the dollar, which is a real challenge that we\u2019ve talked about. And commodity costs and transportation costs are up significantly. Well, if I look back over the past decade in different years, all of those factors have been present. So, there is nothing unique other than perhaps the very significant macro impacts which hopefully will be short-term in nature that preclude HBC companies from building value for shareholders as we go forward. All of the long-term fundamentals that you have to believe in that support market growth, which is the most critical driver of growth, top-line and bottom-line are in place, population growth, income growth in industry that largely continues to focus on innovation as a way to grow its business. And it\u2019s early in the earnings cycle, but if I just look at other competitors that have reported, J&J and Unilever as two examples, I\u2019m very happy to see significant progress on the top-line in those companies as well. That is not indicative of an environment that is problematic for any of us.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. Just, first a housekeeping question on Gillette. Those numbers, the Grooming segment was a lot stronger than I\u2019d anticipated based on the track channel in the U.S. So, can you talk about the Gillette performance in the U.S. specifically, and how much is the Gillette shave club growing versus what we\u2019re seeing in track channels? And then, another question if I can. The pricing conversations you\u2019re having with retailers, there has been a lot of skepticism I guess among investors I talked to about whether you\u2019re going to be able to get those prices through, whether retailers are going to push back, whether you\u2019re going to have to do more promotion to offset that et cetera, et cetera. But if you\u2019re taking more pricing in Home Care and Personal Care, maybe the conversations you\u2019re having with retailers are more productive. So, can you comment on that just at a high level? How easy is it going to be for you to realize that pricing in the market? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","The grooming business in the U.S., let me just -- first of all, it continues -- it is very strong, plus 10% sales growth in the quarter on volume growth that\u2019s higher than that in the face of the competitive expansion. As I was very careful and hopefully clear to describe in our prepared remarks, there will be challenges ahead. But, it gives us a lot of confidence that the strategies we\u2019re putting into marketplace are in fact working as we expected them to. As it relates to offline versus online, that\u2019s much more than a Gillette shave club dynamic. That\u2019s a broader channel switching dynamic. And we continue to do reasonably well though we have more work to do offline in that business -- excuse me, online in that business versus offline. We believe based on the data that we have -- we\u2019re seeing significant growth in Gillette shave club users, and believe based on the data that we\u2019re the only one growing users in the U.S. That\u2019s not a global comment. So, generally, I mean, we\u2019re very cautious. We have a lot more work to do. The competitive activity in the space is very strong and early in its life cycle. But, we take a lot of encouragement from the progress we saw in the quarter.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","Yes. Thanks. John, I was hoping you can talk about just the Skin Care business in general. I mean, that\u2019s an area that outside of China and SK-IIhas struggled for a number of years. And I was hoping, you could just kind of touch on it in the context of A, what\u2019s going on with the skin care category in China, because it\u2019s not just you guys, it seems to be a lot of the beauty players are having some pretty nice success there right now. So, just curious about what you are seeing from the consumer standpoint? And then, maybe you can touch on Olay Whips and kind of what that has meant to the overall Olay franchise?","Jon Moeller","Nik, I\u2019m going to come to that. I\u2019m actually going to step back. I apologize. I\u2019m not good at keeping track in my head of multi-part questions. But, this isn\u2019t your fault, this is my fault. So, I neglected Wendy\u2019s -- to answer Wendy\u2019s question on pricing. I want to come back to that. And then, I\u2019ll come to Skin Care and Olay, Nik. Sorry about that Wendy. ","In terms of support for pricing, the commodity cost impacts we\u2019re talking about are significant. So, I talked about oil as important feedstock for many of our raw materials being up 50% year-on-year, transportation costs being up 25% after a year where they were up significantly before that. And those are all costs that retailers see and understand, in large part because they face the same cost increases in their private label brands, and certainly from a transportation standpoint, they\u2019re seeing all the impacts that we are in and more. The questions that investors are raising relative -- all the questions that you mentioned relative to the pricing are the right ones to raise, and I wouldn\u2019t dismiss any of them. But, the conversations to-date have been encouraging. What we don\u2019t have visibility on, today, are the whole array of competitive activities. So, it\u2019s certainly not sitting here today declaring victory. There\u2019s a lot of work and volatility ahead of us. But, so far, nothing, as I said earlier, that\u2019s definitive that has made overly concerned.","Now, Nik going back to your questions. The Skin Care, if you look at Skin and Personal Care, which is how we look at the business, organic sales increased in the quarter double-digits about 13%. And very, very encouragingly, that growth is broad based. So, SK-II, up over 20%, the balance of the Skin Care portfolio, up close to 20%, Personal Care, up mid to high-single-digits, deodorants growing as well.","If you take the 7% beauty segment growth and exclude SK-II, you would have seen growth of 5% in Q1. So, again, that\u2019s reflective of very broad growth in the beauty portfolio. We\u2019re growing share across that total business with all segments, either growing or holding share. In terms of China, we delivered across the Skin and Personal Care portfolio 22% growth, in Q1, SK-II did lead that as you would expect. But, Olay was close to 20% growth. Olay Skin has now delivered 6 quarters of double-digit growth in China, led by both, innovation, things likeOlay Whips but also the revitalization of the in-store experience and the Olay beauty counters. So, we also are seeing good growth not just offline but online in the Skin business, where e-commerce sales, if you look at the past 12 months in Skin Care up 60%. They\u2019re up 50% calendar year-to-date ahead of the market. So, it\u2019s a broad success story, not simply SK-II. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. ","Stephen Powers","Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Maybe just to build Jon on your response to Wendy\u2019s question on pricing. I want to drill down a little as it relates to Baby and Family, if I could. Just because that\u2019s been where I think the pricing discussions been mostly focused, given your pricing announcements last quarter. And on the one hand, I think we\u2019re all expecting some improvement there, which is obviously constructive. But on the other hand, as you called out, there continues to be investment in value to your products and in particular Luvs for you. So, I was hoping you can address any potential tension that you\u2019re seeing there, and how you see aggregate net pricing trends unfolding as a result, both in Baby and Family and in other categories as you take incremental pricing. I\u2019m just curious, if this is something specific to Baby that we should think about or if this is sort of tug-of-war if that\u2019s the right label, is something we should extrapolate to other categories. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Steve, my answer will likely frustrate, and I apologize for that in advance. But, it\u2019s really too early to sort this out in a meaningful way for you. All signs -- early signs are positive, both in terms of retailer acceptance of the price increases and importantly of competitive announcements, both branded and private label manufacturers and their intent to take pricing. But, it\u2019s not in the marketplace broadly. There are -- some of the Baby Care pricing is in the market, but it\u2019s really, really early. We\u2019ll know a little bit more by Analyst Day, but not a lot, given that\u2019s only three or four weeks away. So, this is a conversation we\u2019re going to continue to want to have as we go through the end of the calendar year and the beginning of next calendar year. I apologize for what may rightly appear like a non-answer but it is just because I don\u2019t have one yet.","Operator","All right. Next, we\u2019ll go to Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to just ask again about the U.S. because at our conference in September, Jon, I feel like you really went out of your way in several forms to discuss a disconnect between the strength that we were seeing in Nielsen and what you expected to see in terms of reported results. So, mentioning things like long-term inventory destocking and the retail trade, dynamics in year-over-year kind of couponing, cost to implement some of the in-store activity that you\u2019re doing in the improved display and support for your innovation. So, if you can just talk about what changed frankly between early September where again you really made a point of saying, don\u2019t look at the scanner, and how things shaped up. And as we look forward, those three, really the two dynamics, the long-term inventory destocking at retail and cost to have a better presence in store to support your innovation. How you expect that to impact U.S. trends going forward. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Fair question, Lauren. Part of the discussion that we had on retail inventory destocking, you\u2019ll recall, was -- and frankly the largest part of the question had to do with channel mix and the relative mix of online versus offline, with online being generally lower inventory carrying channel. And of the things that occurred as we went through the quarter is that some of the significant investment that online retailers were making in consumer acquisition, decreased relatively significantly. And so, while still growing ahead of offline, the growth rates in online at a market level, as the quarter worked its way through, ended up being significantly less than had then the case, for instance, the quarter before, the quarter before that. And that\u2019s one of the drivers of the impact.","There was also a fair amount of channel mix beyond just the offline online dynamic that changed as we went through the quarter, which had an impact on where we actually came out. We were -- we tried to be very clear that the investments we were making with retailers were in assets, not just additional trade spending, and that we hoped that those investments in assets, whether that was displays, whether that\u2019s placement, would earn the return that we expected it to, and that that has largely occurred. And we had even greater strength than we expected on some of our innovation launches, Pampers Pure for example, which now leads the naturals segment and diapers in track channels. So, a number of relatively favorable things came into play. Can those reverse themselves over time? Certainly. But, I also look at the progress that we made in market share as indicative of relative strength that should continue working for us as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Joe Altobello","Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. So, I guess, first, Jon, you did allude to a modest acceleration in market growth, both here as well as internationally. I was curious what was driving that? Is it more volume-driven? Are you seeing more trade-up or is this more reflective of less emotional activity? And then, maybe secondly on Grooming, obviously that stood out. And I know it\u2019s one quarter. I know you\u2019ve got to great pains this morning to say it\u2019s one quarter. But, what would we need to see for you guys to declare that that business is fixed? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Drivers of the increase in market growth are all of the above, Joe. So, if you just look at our business as representative, the 4% volume growth -- sorry, 4% sales growth in the U.S. was on the back of 5% volume growth. So, there is some acceleration in unit consumption. We continue to see the premium parts of the portfolio in many cases growing at a faster rate than the balance of the portfolio. So, it\u2019s innovation and mix up, that\u2019s occurring. The promotion levels aren\u2019t significantly different quarter-to-quarter or year-on-year. I mean, you have the Nielsen data. The percentage of our volume that moved on consumption on promotion is not significantly different from either the prior quarter or the year-ago quarter.","And fundamentally, we have as we all know, a very low unemployment rates, some increases in wage rates, generally strong consumer confidence. And it\u2019s playing through across all the drivers at a very modest level of acceleration in market growth that you would expect to see. On Gillette, I\u2019d like to see 4 to 6 to 8 quarters of continued progress, and that\u2019s certainly what we\u2019re working to achieve.","Operator","And next, we\u2019ll go to Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you. I wanted to circle back to China with a couple of quick questions. What was your total organic sales growth in the quarter? And then, how did that compare to category growth? And then, as you look out how sustainable do you think category growth in China is? And wondering, if you guys have any concerns about consumer pushback on U.S. brands and manufacturers due to tariffs. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","We haven\u2019t seen any appreciable impact of tariff situation on consumer attitudes towards brands. We certainly didn\u2019t see that in the quarter, again with very strong growth rates across several of our brands. There is nothing that we\u2019ve seen that would indicate a significant drop in the market growth rate across categories, either consumption levels or appetite for premium products. In fact, the categories again that we continue to do best on or the categories that we\u2019re best positioned from a premium offering standpoint and the categories that we\u2019re struggling more with, that\u2019s less the case.","The organic sales growth in China for the quarter was 4%. Again, if you flash back to minus 5% couple of years ago to plus 1%, plus 7% last year, there is a fair amount of volatility within the quarters. If we look at underlying consumptions and market share growth, market share actually improved quarter-to-quarter in China. So, I expect over couple of quarter period, we\u2019re still solidly in the mid singles to high single digit growth rate there. I know there is a lot of concern that\u2019s been expressed, not just with regard to our categories but more broadly. I understand the GDP figures were down that were released today, but GDP at 6.5% still offers significant opportunity. So, there is nothing that we are aware of today that has significantly changed our outlook for our business in China.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, Jon. So, just following up on pricing and couponing. So, you spoke about the plans to increase pricing before on a few more categories but you\u2019re also planning on reducing couponing in the U.S. going forward as you probably got more of conversion ratio than I think you probably expected. And so, how are you thinking of net pricing premium against your branded competitors and private label going forward? And related to that, are you concerned on pantry stocking because of couponing, in particular in the Costco couponing in the month of September and also on SK-II in Asia? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Well, I don\u2019t want to get into a lot of details. The business in October and the momentum that it continues to indicate is not indicative of a situation where that will lead you to the believe that the July-September results were driven by a lot of pantry stocking, either here or in China across the brand portfolio. I don\u2019t think that that is the case.","In terms of our spread versus others on price, net price, I don\u2019t expect a significant change. You are right. We have reduced couponing in a couple of categories; and you\u2019re right that was because those coupons over redeemed and we wanted to pull that -- dial that back a little bit. There, we\u2019re also -- we go through cycles and it\u2019s different by category, by market where we\u2019re introducing new products for example, and you\u2019ll see an increase in the rate of couponing and promotion to drive trial. But, there\u2019s nothing that is systemic, either up or down that I see relative to our desired net price premiums vis-\u00e0-vis our competitive set.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yes. Thanks and good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about private label or retailer brands, however you want to think about that. It seems like 12 months ago or more, there was certainly a lot of talk increasing amounts of shelf space, emphasis being put on the category partly just because it made under-indexed, especially in the U.S. and partly because it can put pressure on pricing. And fast forward to today, it seems like it\u2019s far as less pronounced. I guess, one, do you see that from a retailer standpoint in your conversations? And two, if yes, what do you think has driven that, and do you believe that that can ultimately result or should ultimately result in A&P spend and sort of more of a traditional spends continuing or ultimately increasing off of current levels to sustain what seems like some momentum against that shift?","Jon Moeller","Private label, as you know, is primarily a European and U.S. dynamic, not entirely, but primarily. In Europe, private label market shares are down slightly after three years of basically flat performance. In the U.S., in a couple -- and in the U.S., the percentage of private label that are sold in a given category, varies dramatically from almost nothing to 20% to 30% of business that\u2019s moved in a category. So, as a result of that, we would expect this -- the dynamics are very, very different by category. There are categories where we see continued retailer interest and increasing their private label presence. Private label market share in the quarter we just completed in aggregate was up about 40 basis points. Our share was also up about 40 basis points in aggregate. The category that\u2019s seen the most increase in private label sales is the Family Care business. Our market shares are also doing very well and are increasing in that business. So, I hesitate to tell an overarching private label story because I don\u2019t think there is one. But, it is definitely something that continues to be of interest to retailers across channels. That\u2019s been the case for many, many years. And oftentimes, the increase in private label, which leads to a reduction in branded assortment, it\u2019s very rare that that comes out of the number one or number two position brand in the market. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re immune. Private label manufacturers are doing an increasingly good job at delivering quality products to consumers. And so, I\u2019m not dismissive of it in any way, but also I think we\u2019re well-positioned to deal with it.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll go to Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks. Good morning. Jon, I wanted to come back to the pricing discussion. And I apologize if I missed this part, the two-part question. What specifically came in better in the first quarter? You have been guiding to declines in Q1 and then gradually getting better. But, what very specifically by region, by category came in better? That\u2019s the first part of the question. And then, the second part is, there still seems like there is a little bit of a wait and see from your perspective on where you can take pricing, what categories et cetera. So, specifically in the U.S., do you view this as a retailer receptivity issue, Walmart recently speaking unsurprising so, about maintaining its lowest price positioning in the marketplace, or do you more see this as a competitive dynamic? Whether this is what\u2019s going on North American Fabric Care with Brazil et cetera? So, any commentary there will be helpful. Thanks for both of those.","Jon Moeller","The first question, what changed in terms of our pricing outlook? Frankly, not a lot. So, when we were talking about negative pricing in the first quarter in our own mind, that was kind of a minus 1-point impact where we ended up rounded to neutral. So, there wasn\u2019t a massive change that occurred as we went through the quarter. We did take some additional steps to reduce, both inefficient trade spending and couponing, that improved things a little bit. And then there were price increases that we took in different parts of the world, particularly the developing markets. As the quarter progressed, the FX situation deteriorated rapidly, and that caused us to make moves that we wouldn\u2019t have anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.","In terms of the uncertainty looking forward. That is much more in my mind a competitive related concern than it is a customer related concern. And it\u2019s not -- concern is probably not even the right semantic to use. It\u2019s just the reality, when prices start moving in the marketplace, not everybody moves in lockstep and there are different dynamics that are introduced and capitalized on, different view by different manufacturers. So, it\u2019s just very hard to look forward with a pure clean crystal ball and say here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. That would be disingenuous.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So, real quick question on the sales inflection that we saw from this quarter versus the fiscal fourth quarter, a nice step up, the way we cut the numbers, it seems like price mix was a key contributor in the inflection, and also Grooming and Fabric Care. So, my question is, what in your mind really drove the price mix inflection that we saw quarter-on-quarter? And then, at a segment level, what drove the improvement in your view in Fabric Care and any update on China Diapers? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Price mix continues to benefit from our innovation efforts and our efforts to increase our level of superiority and advantage and solving fundamental consumer problems. So, the fastest growing parts of our portfolios, as I\u2019ve indicated before are some of the premium price, more innovative segments where we\u2019ve brought real performance difference into the marketplace, whether that\u2019s unit does detergents, whether that\u2019s fabric enhancer beads, whether that\u2019s adult incontinence products, whether it\u2019s some of the natural products, the net with and benefit efficacy and natural. So, all of that reflective of the strategy that we\u2019ve described, and we\u2019ll talk about more on Analyst Day are playing themselves out in the marketplace.","The other difference that I just mentioned in response to the last question is that we are starting to put price in the market as it relates to both, commodities and foreign exchange. And I apologize, I\u2019ve once again failed to remember parts of the question, but that\u2019s the answer of the first part, at least.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jon, I\u2019ll keep this simple for you and stay focused. I want to delve into the mix drag on gross margin. It was lot bigger than we\u2019ve seen last couple of years and certainly a lot bigger than we expected. I know you mentioned in prepared remarks a couple of things around it, but I was hoping you could give us a little more detail, unpack the components of it. It\u2019s especially surprising to see it in context of the U.S. strength. I guess, I\u2019ve always assumed that part of the mix drag was U.S. weakness. Why are we seeing the acceleration? It sounds like there\u2019s maybe some transitory stuff in there. Can you unpack it and give us the magnitude and expected duration? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Yes. First of all, Jason, it\u2019s wonderful to hear from you without your barking dog. Just kidding. In terms of gross margin, I want to make a couple of things clear, both here and going forward. When you\u2019re in these -- and this isn\u2019t addressing your mix question, I\u2019ll come to that in a second. But I just want to take advantage of your question to make this point. When you\u2019re in an environment of increasing commodity and costs and foreign exchange hurts, it\u2019s almost inevitable that you\u2019re going to see margin compression, both on the gross and operating line. And that results from the simple fact that even if you\u2019re 100% successful with your pricing plans, you are typically taking pricing to recover costs. You\u2019re not taking pricing to recover margin. That\u2019s not that you wouldn\u2019t like to take pricing to recover margin but that\u2019s not typically what you can accomplish. So, I do expect that as we go through the cycle, we\u2019re going to continue to see some pressure. We\u2019ll see if productively cost overcomes, but we\u2019ll continue to see some pressure on margins.","Relevant to mix, I mentioned earlier that some of the fastest growing portions of the portfolio are the premium price segments. There\u2019s a very understandable belief, though it\u2019s not accurate that those higher priced segments are higher margin. In fact, what\u2019s true about that belief is that generally they\u2019re higher penny profit per unit. So, we want to sell as many of them as we can. But they often come at a lower margin. So, the math of a shift in the business to unit dose detergents, to adult incontinence products, to pure natural products is a positive one from a value creation standpoint but it leads to negative margin mix. And I expect that to be with us as well as we continue to implement our superiority strategy, again with productivity there too will offset a significant portion of that. And in a benign commodity and FX environment, I would expect this to continue to grow margin. But, that doesn\u2019t mean that that negative mix component would go away.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge.","Jonathan Feeney","What portion of your total global volume will see a price increase planned, as of right now, by the end of this fiscal year? Rough number would be fine. And more broadly, could you comment about how the pricing process has changed over the past 5 or 10 years with maybe more data driven and sometimes more adversarial or in some cases maybe better relations or more transparent relations with retailers? How that game has changed that what it means us as we look the revenue impact in these price increases? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","I don\u2019t think anything significant has changed in terms of how we think about pricing. And some of the important components of that are, we want to whenever possible, link pricing to innovation moves, so that the total value that we\u2019re offering consumers is accretive, not dilutive. And that will cause -- that has a significant impact on the timing on which pricing is taken. I mentioned that the categories in the U.S., we\u2019ve announced additional pricing, we\u2019ll be linking that to innovation which will come in the second half of the year. And generally, that\u2019s a much more successful way to think about this. Short of that and a continued emphasis on that dynamic, no significant changes going forward.","In terms of the percentage of -- for very understandable reasons, probably 80% of this conversation has been about pricing and ability to take pricing and ability to keep pricing. Again, I understand that. I am in no way frustrated or surprised by that. But, if I think about the percentage of volume of our internal conversations and planning, and what I really think is driving our business, pricing is a relatively small percent of that dialogue. We need to take pricing in some markets and in some categories. We\u2019ll do that behind innovation when we can. But the much bigger driver of success, both in the quarter we just completed and going forward, is the execution of the broad strategy.","Products -- first of all, the category choices that we\u2019re playing in where performance determines brand choice, commitment to deliver superior performance in a superior package, communicated in the superior way, executed with excellence in store at a good value for both consumers and our retail partners, all underpinned by productivity and significant changes in the way that we\u2019re organizing ourselves and strengthening our culture to be more responsive to emerging consumer needs, more efficient in those responses, more accountable in those responses. Those by far are the much more important things to think about as we think about both the quarter and the year going forward.","Look, we\u2019ll continue to talking about pricing as we should at Investor Day, but you\u2019ll see the focus much more on that strategy, which again I think is much, much more fundamental in terms of what actually happened in the quarter that we just concluded and what the outlook is going forward.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17475":["Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Q3 2012 Earnings Call April 27, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jon R.

If you will refer to P&G\u2019s most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.","Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon R. Moeller","Thanks. And good morning, everyone. Joining me this morning are Bob McDonald and Teri List.","I'll begin today's call with a summary of our third quarter results, and Teri will provide highlights for some of our largest product categories. I'll provide an update on our growth strategies in both developed and developing markets, as well as our productivity efforts, and then conclude the call with guidance for the June quarter and fiscal year 2012. We'll take questions after our prepared remarks and will be available after the call to provide additional perspective as needed. Also, we'll be posting slides containing the business segment information on our website, www.pg.com, following the call.","As a housekeeping matter, please note that our results and guidance are now presented with the Pringles business reported as discontinued operations, ending the divestiture of the business to Kellogg. Pringles sales and earnings are no longer included in organic sales or core earnings per share numbers. Related to this change, we're moving to 5 reporting segments, with Pet Care now included in the Fabric Care and Home Care segment.","Moving to results, our third quarter underlying results were within our guidance ranges. Organic sales growth was at the low end of our estimates, and core earnings per share were towards the high end of the expected range. All-in sales growth was 2%. This includes a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Organic sales were up 3%. Top-line growth was broad-based, with all 5 reporting segments growing organic sales for the third consecutive quarter. ","January to March results include the impact of business disruption and substantial price reductions in Venezuela, leading up to and following the publication of the new price control regulations. In the period leading up to the pricing announcement in Venezuela, it was unclear for manufacturers and retailers what pricing would have actually been mandated. Because of this, many retailers reduced or stopped ordering product to prevent holding inventory at a higher cost than what they would eventually be able to sell the product to consumers for. This significantly impacted our volume in the country during the quarter. Additionally, when the pricing restructuring were announced, we began reducing prices on our products by as much as 25%. ","While shipments and lower pricing in Venezuela negatively affected third quarter organic sales growth for the total company by more than 0.5%, excluding these impacts, organic sales for the quarter would have been 4%. This marks our 10th consecutive quarter with organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%, averaging 4% over those 2.5 years. ","Organic volume was in line with prior year levels. Pricing contributed 5 points to organic sales growth, positively benefiting all 5 reporting segments. This marks the third consecutive quarter where pricing has added 4 or more points to sales growth and the third consecutive quarter where pricing has been a positive contributor to sales growth in each reported segment. Mix reduced sales by 2 points is due mainly to disproportionate growth in developing markets.","Shifting now to markets. Market growth has been decelerating on a volume basis. Developed markets were down slightly in our categories in the third quarter, reflecting weak economic conditions. North America volume growth in our categories slowed from 1% over the past 12 months to about 0.5% over the past 6 months to essentially flat for the past 3 months. Western Europe remained down about 0.5 point versus prior year on a volume basis. Developed region market value was up about 2 points on a constant currency value basis due to pricing. ","Markets in developing regions are faring much better. Developing regions underlying market volume was up 4% for the quarter, and constant currency sales were up about 10%. We've seen a modest sequential deceleration in market volume in Asia and Latin America over the past 12 months as more price increases have reached the market. However, the value contribution from pricing has more than offset slower volume growth.","P&G global market share for the quarter was down very modestly versus prior year as share growth in developing markets was more than offset by soft market share trends in developed regions. Market share was in line, our higher end businesses representing about 45% of global sales, consistent with December quarter results. We held or grew share in 7 of our top 15 countries and on 13 of our 26 billion-dollar brands. Those who are paying close attention may note that we've increased the number of billion-dollar brands from 24 to 26, as Vicks and SK-II each crossed this billion-dollar annual sales threshold during the March quarter. ","There are a few category\/country combinations where we lost significant share when we increased list prices and competitors did not. We're taking proactive steps to restore the value of our brands relative to competitive offerings in these markets. In early February, in the U.S. auto dish category, we effectively reversed the 80% lease price increase we took last summer. In U.S. powder laundry detergent, we introduced bonus packs on select brands and sizes and notified the trade of our decision to adjust list prices in the summer. We've also taken steps to correct price gaps in the U.K. laundry detergent business. ","There are few additional category\/country combinations where we've lost market share due to increased competitive promotional activity. In U.S. Oral Care, we are facing an unprecedented level of promotional spending. Fact channel reports for our primary competitor shows 67% of their volume moving on promotion, an increase of 16% versus prior year levels. The depth of promotional discount was 34% off everyday shelf price, a 43% increase in depth of the discount versus prior year. Our primary competitor in the U.S. blades and razors category has been promoting at extremely high levels on a nearly continuous basis for the past 2 years since their last new product launch. Increase in the percentage of their volume moved down promotion by more than 50%. While we have grown market share on our top-tier Fusion ProGlide product, which was the #2 innovation as measured by retail sales in North America in 2011, competitive promotion levels have resulted in their top products being priced down to a Mach3 level. As a result, Mach3 volume and market share have been under pressure. Last, in the Mexico laundry detergent category, one of our international competitors has been promoting at extremely high levels following an unsuccessful new brand launch. ","We have recently began announcing our plans to our retail customers to restore relative consumer value in these 3 categories and protect our market share position. We expect corrective list price reductions and promotional increases to be limited to just a few category\/country combinations. I've just talked about 6 category\/country combinations. We do business in over 1,000. We do not currently expect the broad scale reversal of the price increases we implemented over the past 5 quarters or those we're implementing right now. We expect to see progressive improvement in market share as the pricing gaps I have mentioned are addressed. For perspective, if share in the 6 businesses I've just discussed have been flat or growing during the March quarter, we would have built overall company market share and held our growing share in businesses representing about 55% of our global sales. ","From a regional standpoint, we have been outpaced in North America, as you've seen in recent market share reports. We're prioritizing innovation in this market with items like Tide PODS, Always and Tampax Radiant, Crest Pro-Health Clinical, Pantene Ice Shine, Downy Unstopables, Bounty Trap & Lock, Febreze car air fresheners and Gillette ProGlide Styler. Also, the targeted price adjustments I just described, 4 of the 6 are in North America. We're committed to a healthy business in North America, and we'll take the necessary steps to deliver this. ","Shifting to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $0.94 towards the top end of our guidance range and in line with prior year levels. Higher commodity cost, the impact of Venezuela pricing regulations and a higher core tax rate were offset by the benefits from higher pricing and strong cost savings results. ","Our guidance for third quarter earnings per share after adjusting for Pringles was $0.89 to $0.95. As we said on our last earnings call and at CAGNY, this guidance did not include the impact of price controls in Venezuela, which were eventually announced in late February. We estimate this negatively impacted the third quarter by approximately $0.03 per share. The quarter also included, though, a $0.03 per share gain in the core tax rate versus our guidance. ","All-in earnings were $0.82 per share. This includes $0.13 per share of noncore charges primarily related to restructuring activities. The noncore charges also includes final small adjustment to goodwill values for the Appliances and Salon Professional businesses. ","Core gross margin declined 100 basis points. Pricing improved gross margin by roughly 230 basis points and savings projects helped gross margin by approximately 130 basis points. These benefits were more than offset by a 230 basis point negative impact from higher commodity costs and a 210 basis point negative impact from a combination of product and geographic mix.","Core SG&A costs were down 110 basis points due mainly to top-line leverage and 50 basis points of lower overhead costs, driven by productivity improvements. ","Core operating profit turned positive, growing 2% for the quarter despite a 3-point negative impact from Venezuela. We've made sequential improvement through this fiscal year, with core operating profit progressing from down 4% in the first 2 quarters to up 2% in the third quarter and up 5% excluding Venezuela. We expect this metric to improve further in our fourth quarter and again next fiscal year. ","Core operating profit margin grew 10 basis points, including about 180 basis points of productivity improvements and cost savings. ","On an all-in basis, gross margin was down 150 basis points, and SG&A costs increased 70 basis points with all-in operating profit margin down 230 basis points. All of the decline was due to 230 basis points of noncore restructuring investments.","The effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 23.7%. Excluding the impact of noncore items, the effective tax rate on core earnings was 23.4%, which compares to a base period core tax rate of 20.8%. This difference reduced earnings by share by about $0.03 per share and lowered the core earnings per share growth rate by 3 percentage points.","We generated $2.9 billion in free cash flow in the quarter with free cash flow productivity of 119%. We returned $3.8 billion of cash to shareholders this quarter through $1.5 billion of dividends and $2.3 billion of share repurchases. ","Earlier this month, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7%, making this the 122nd consecutive year in which we paid the dividend and the 56th consecutive year in which the dividend has increased. At the new annualized dividend of about $2.25 per share, our dividend yield is approximately 3.4%. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Teri to review some of the highlights of our business results.","Teri L. List-Stoll","Thanks, Jon. As a reminder, I'll not be covering all 5 of our reporting segments but rather, we'll cover some of the highlights of our larger categories. For more information on business segment results, please refer to the press release we issued this morning and slides that will be posted on our website, pg.com, at the conclusion of this call.","Segment results reflected dynamics of the macro and competitive environment. Developing markets continue to perform well, with sales growing double digits for the quarter and value share increasing for the ninth consecutive quarter. A few highlights include India delivering its 39th consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth, Brazil growing sales over 30% and building share for the 25th consecutive period, and Russia growing value share for the 10th month in a row. As Jon mentioned, we've had some more specific challenges in developed markets, which you'll hear about in the segment discussion. ","Starting with the Beauty segment. Organic sales growth was 2% behind volume growth of 1% and positive pricing of 5%, mix reduced sales by 4%. At the category level, Hair Care volume grew low single digits, driven by developing markets. Brazil Hair Care shipments increased nearly 20% and value share was up more than 2 points, with double-digit volume growth on both Pantene and Head & Shoulders. Greater China Hair Care volume was up low teens and shampoo value share grew nearly 1 point, with Head & Shoulders volume increasing nearly 25% behind a product restage and commercial innovation. India Hair Care shipments grew more than 50% with Pantene more than doubling, driven by Pantene sachets. In developed markets, North America Hair Care volume was down low single digits. Volume growth on both Pantene and Head & Shoulders was offset by volume declines in the hair color business, driven by a high base period with initiative launches. Pantene shipments were up double digits behind the launch of the Pantene Ice Shine and Aqua Light initiatives and a refocused marketing campaign.","Global Skin Care shipments were down mid single digits. Developing markets were about flat. An example of developing markets progress is the Philippines, where Olay volume grew nearly 50% and share increased over 3.5 points behind supportive Natural White sachets and increased trial and distribution, but we have some challenges in markets like China. In North America, volume declined due to the significant competitive activity in the mid-priced tier. We're taking steps to address these trends by introducing 6 new items into the mid-tier anti-aging and cleansing segment and starter kits across the Pro-X lineup. Also, our new Olay Facial Hair Removal innovation is off to a strong start. Sales are 50% higher than our launch target and has been the #1 selling facial skin care item with Hispanics and African-Americans.","In the Grooming segment, global blades and razors shipments increased low single digits and value share increased slightly. Asia volume was up high single digits, and value share was up nearly 2 points behind Gillette Guard growth in India, expansion of Fusion ProGlide into several new markets and overall market growth. North America volume declined mid-single digits. Fusion ProGlide delivered strong volume growth behind the launch of the ProGlide Styler, which earned over 20 share of the razor category after only 5 weeks after launching. This increase, however, was more than offset by customer inventory adjustments and declines in the Gillette legacy and Mach3 businesses as competition continued to invest heavily in promotional spending on their Hydro product. As Jon said, we have increased promotional levels in this market to help address this dynamic. ","In Health Care, Oral Care volume was down slightly versus a year ago. In the U.S., volume was flat and share was down. Over the past 2 years, our U.S. Oral Care business has delivered very strong volume share and sales growth and, as Jon mentioned, has recently been faced with heightened levels of promotional spending. Throughout this, our core business continued to perform well, with Crest 3D White toothpaste delivering its 24th consecutive period of share growth, increasing every month since launch. Additionally, early results show that the March launches of the Crest Pro-Health Clinical Regimen and the Crest 3D White Glamorous White Toothpaste are off to a strong start. We've also made modest increases to our promotional levels to be more competitive. Greater China Oral Care faced a challenging third quarter, with volume down double digits primarily due to an uncompetitive value profile, especially in the premium segment. We expect to see the business begin to recover in the fourth quarter as the price gaps have recently begun to narrow and as we launched new innovations and implement strengthened marketing plans. Latin America Oral Care volume grew mid-teens and share was up behind the successful Oral-B toothpaste expansion market. Brazil toothpaste was over a 6% value share on a national basis and nearly 11% where it is distributed. In Colombia and Peru, where Oral-B toothpaste just launched this quarter, results have exceeded expectations. In the fourth quarter, we'll continue our Latin America expansion, moving into Argentina, Chile and the high-frequency store channel in Brazil. Our European toothpaste expansion markets also continued to deliver ahead of expectation. In the U.K., where we launched last July, value share is over 8% with a positive halo benefit on the balance of our Oral Care business, driving P&G to the #2 position in the overall category. ","In the Fabric and Home Care segment, organic sales grew 2%. Positive pricing of 7% more than offset a 3% volume decline. Mix was negative too. Global Fabric Care volume declined low single digits. Developing market shipments were up low single digits, led by Asia's double-digit growth. India Fabric Care volume increased nearly 20%, and share increased more than 1.5 points to 13%, with all price tiers growing. Another driver was Downy fabric enhancers with shipments in Asia up nearly 25% due to recent expansion into Indonesia and Korea. Developed market Fabric Care volume was down despite several positive developments this quarter. We're seeing value share growth in U.S. Tide and Downy. Early results on Tide PODS are very positive. After only 1 month in market, Tide PODS have reached a 67% dollar share of the unit dose category. Shipments are about 30% ahead of our going-in expectation. Downy Unstopables are shipping twice as high as expected. This growth, however, has been more than offset by the impact of our uncompetitive prices in U.S. powder laundry and the U.K. laundry category. As Jon mentioned earlier, we've taken steps to address this situation.","Global Home Care shipments and value share were down slightly versus a year ago, with developed market volume declining mid single digits and developing markets growing mid-teens. The Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa region led the growth, with volume up over 20% and value share up 1.5 points. The growth was broad-based due mainly to recent category expansions, including dish care into Turkey and Air Care into Eastern Europe. U.S. Air Care volume was up mid single digits, and value share grew over 1.5 points behind the new Febreze Car Vent Clip that is exceeding expectations and has reached over 15 shares of the car care category. This growth was more than offset by softness in the auto dishwashing category. Jon shared earlier that in February, we reversed our previous price increases in this category. We started to see lower pricing on shelf and sequential improvement in market share trends.","Finally, the Baby and Family Care segment increased organic sales at 6%. Volume growth of 3% and pricing of 5% was partially offset by negative mix of 2%. Global Baby Care volume was up low single digits, and value share grew over 0.5 point. Developing market shipments increased mid-teens, with strong growth across multiple markets. The BRIC markets increased volume by over 20% on average. In developed markets, shipments declined mid-single digits. North America share increased over 0.5 point, while volume was down due to the contracting market. Family Care volume was up low single digits, driven by the recent North America launch of the Bounty Trap & Lock technology upgrade. Customer response has been very positive, with increased distribution and record levels of merchandising and display.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jon.","Jon R. Moeller","Thanks, Teri. Before we discuss guidance, I want to provide some additional perspective on our results. Two of our primary objectives for this fiscal year were to maintain top-line growth momentum and to make meaningful improvement in core operating profit growth. On the top line, as I said earlier, this is our 10th consecutive quarter with organic sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%, averaging 4% over those 2.5 years. Over the past 4 quarters, we've executed nearly $3 billion in price increases and delivered 4% organic sales growth. On the bottom line, core operating profit growth has improved, moving from down 4% in each of the first 2 quarters of this year to growth of 2% this quarter, which is 5% excluding the Venezuela impacts. We expect further acceleration of operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.","So we've made progress on both of these fronts. The pace of operating profit improvement has been slower than we expected when we began this fiscal year due primarily to several headwinds, including developed market growth rates, competitive pricing and promotion dynamics, foreign exchange, which has been about $0.5 billion hit since we first provided guidance for the year, and several market level setbacks. We're working to offset these headwinds through innovation, the expansion of our portfolio in developing markets where growth is stronger, and with our significant productivity interventions. I want to cover each of those briefly.","Innovation, as we've said many times, is the best antidote to sluggish growth in developed markets. We're upgrading existing products with innovations like the Crest & Oral-B Pro-Health Clinical lineup and a significant performance improvement across the Bounty franchise. Earlier this month, we launched Always and Tampax Radiant, our first ever Feminine Care initiative that spans across our total franchise of pads, tampons, liners and wipes. We're launching new forms in current categories with products like Tide PODS. We're entering new categories with items such as Downy Unstopables and the fabric scent enhancer segment, Febreze car air freshener in the car air care segment, and Olay's Smooth Finish in the facial hair removal segment. In June, we will launch ZzzQuil, Vicks' first entry into the U.S. sleep aid segment of Personal Health Care. ","We're expanding recent innovations to new markets. In February, we launched Lenor Aroma Jewel Beads in Japan, a local version of Downy Unstopables. It quickly grew to nearly a 4% share of the fabric enhancer market. We've now expanded Fusion ProGlide to more than 30 countries across North America, Western Europe and major markets in that CEEMEA region. And through our joint venture with Teva Pharmaceuticals, we have announced plans to expand the Vicks brand to sell at Eastern European markets in June, including Russia and Poland. These are just the few examples of recent and upcoming product innovation. ","P&G innovations continue to lead the industry. As reflected in the most recent IRI Pacesetters report, which ranks new U.S. innovation launches based on dollar sales, P&G had the first and second most successful new initiatives, 3 of the top 10 and 8 of the top 25 nonfood innovations in the United States in 2011. For perspective, our 6 largest competitors had a total of 7 innovations in the top 25. Over the 17-year history of this report, P&G has launched 140 top 25 ranked innovations, 1\/3 of the cumulative total for the industry, more than our 6 leading competitors combined and 5x more than the second ranked competitor.","In addition to product innovation, we've just kicked off the strongest global commercial innovation program in company history. Last week, we started a worldwide retail activation of our Olympics sponsorship. Retailers around the globe are partnering with us to make this our largest Multi-Brand Commercial Innovation. Our online marketing program launched 2 weeks ago. And last week, we kicked off the global Thanks, Mom campaign that will build with significant online, on-air and in-store events through Mother's Day. Our Olympics program includes more than 30 P&G brands and 150 athletes around the world. In the U.S. alone, we expect to generate over $5 billion consumer impressions and generate returns in our marketing investments at least twice as high as our normal merchandising programs. Over the course of the campaign, we expect our global Olympics commercial innovation to generate up to $500 million in incremental sales across both developed and developing markets.","The combination of strong product and commercial innovation, coupled with the limited pricing interventions I described, should enable us to grow in developed markets despite the underlying market growth challenges. ","The second way we'll cut the slowdown in developed market growth is to continue delivering strong growth in developing markets. Our volume sales and market share growth trends in these regions have been very strong, averaging 12% organic sales growth over the past 4 quarters and growing market share on a value basis for 9 consecutive quarters. We're rapidly expanding our presence in these regions, adding about 15 new country\/category businesses over this fiscal year and last. Developing markets will represent about 37% of annual sales and 45% of volume by the end of this fiscal year. We're doing this in part to access faster near-term growth and in part because we see it as a longer-term growth opportunity. ","In 2010 to 2020, the global population is expected to increase by nearly 700 million people, with 95% of this growth in developing markets. Growth will be even faster in terms of wealth between 2010 and 2020. 1 billion individuals in developing markets will move out of poverty, earning more than USD $10 a day, a key take-off point for our product categories. Based on a study published by the OECD Development Centre, the world's middle class will increase by over 1.4 billion consumers by 2020, with over 98% of these people living in developing markets. The number of millionaire households is expected to increase by more than 200% in developing markets. In the BRIC markets alone, this is an incremental 2 million households at the millionaire level. We're tiering up our portfolios to delight consumers as their wealth increases and they begin purchasing in the premium and super premium tiers while continuing to attract new consumers into our categories at lower tiers with affordable innovations.","There's an understandable question about whether we can be successful in coming from behind in some developing markets. We have good long-term success growing in markets, where we are coming from behind. In 1991, P&G sales in Asia were $1.5 billion, less than 40% of Unilever sales. In 2001, P&G sales were $4 billion, up to 56% of Unilever size. Today, P&G sales in Asia are over $12 billion, now over 95% of Unilever's.","There's also been a question of whether we can achieve this growth profitably. One misconception that feeds the profit question is that developing markets consumers are all core and then all growth will come at low price point. The BRIC markets actually have fairly well-developed premium and super premium tiers. These higher tiers are growing ahead of the overall market in many of the developing countries. For example, in China, the super premium tier, which is already 17% of sales in the market, is growing at a 30% pace. Developing market consumers are willing to pay for products they value. The price for product sold in many of our categories in the more developed or the developing markets is as high as similar products in the U.S. ","As we expand our category and price tier portfolios, we develop more scale. Scale allows us to purchase medium more efficiently, use our distributors more effectively, and leverage the P&G portfolio with customers and consumers. We know from history that developing market growth becomes increasingly profitable over time. In markets such as China, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines where we have built scale to a broad portfolio of products, have local production in place and compete at multiple price tiers within categories, our margins are roughly in line with the company average. As a result, we'd expect our developing market expansions to be profit-accretive, not dilutive, over a reasonable period of time.","To make the investment in innovation we want to make, to support our portfolio expansions in developing markets, to overcome macroeconomic headwinds and at the same time deliver the earnings progress you and we expect, we have to become much more productive. At CAGNY, we outlined a 5-year plan to save up to $10 billion from a projected cost pool of around $85 billion in fiscal year 2016. We discussed opportunities in nearly every element of cost, from materials and manufacturing to marketing to overheads, and we are moving forward on each of these. When I discussed cost of goods for the March quarter, I mentioned savings around 130 basis points. This was consistent with the level of savings we expect to deliver on average over the life of the $10 billion program. We've already begun the planning and optimization -- optimizing that will enable to us generate 10 to 20 basis points of productivity per year for the marketing spend pool. ","Some have questioned why we would cut our marketing investments. We're not. We'll grow it significantly, just slightly below the rate of sales growth. And many of the savings will be in nonadvertising marketing cost. ","Turning to overhead. We've announced plans to reduce nonmanufacturing enrollment by 10% over 2 years, and have already taken the steps that are necessary to reduce enrollment by 3% by the end of this fiscal year. We began to see a portion of these savings in the March quarter, which helped us reduce core SG&A spending by 50 basis points. We've made significant progress on the design work for the additional role reductions that we're targeting by the end of next fiscal year. We're on track to deliver the cost savings objectives we discussed 2 months ago for this fiscal year and over the 5-year period we outlined at CAGNY.","All-in, we believe we have a plan to maintain solid top-line momentum while continuing to improve operating profit. The headwinds we've had to deal with this year do reduce, though, the amplitude of this improvement, which is reflected in our guidance. For the April to June quarter, we're estimating organic sales growth in the range of 4% to 5%. Within this, we expect pricing will contribute 4 to 5 points to sales growth, again, this quarter. Foreign exchange is expected to reduce sales by about 3%, which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% versus the prior year. On the bottom line, we expect June quarter earnings per share in the range of $0.79 to $0.85, or down 4% to up 4% versus base period core earnings per share of $0.82. ","The core earnings per share growth rate includes notable headwinds from the tax rate and nonoperating income versus prior year. The effective tax rate in the June quarter of last year was 21.1%, and we expect the comparable rate to be about 400 basis points higher this year. This equates to roughly a 6-point headwind on earnings per share growth for the quarter or about $0.05 per share. Also, nonoperating income in the prior year included the sale of a minor brand that added $0.03 to earnings per share, and we're not planning for a similar benefit in the current year. This is an additional 4-point earnings per share growth headwind. Adjusting for tax and nonoperating income headwind, this quarter's guidance equates to core earnings per share growth in the range of 6% to 14%. As I've mentioned earlier, we expect continued improvement in core operating profit and core operating profit margin. Commodity cost will be a much smaller year-on-year headwind as we have finally annualized the majority of the cost increases we experienced over the last year. In addition, we'll have a full benefit of pricing. The net of these impacts, combined with our cost savings and top-line levered benefits, are expected to drive core operating profit growth in the mid single digits to double-digit range for the quarter. ","On an all-in basis, we estimate earnings per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.32. This includes the expected one-time gain of $0.47 to $0.50 per share from the divestiture of the Pringles business to Kellogg and $0.02 per share for the operating earnings from the businesses which are reported as discontinued operations. We are now projecting that we'll be able to close the Pringles divestiture by the end of our fiscal year subject to receiving the necessary regulatory approvals. The all-in earnings per share range for the quarter also includes noncore restructuring charges in the range of $0.05 to $0.07 per share.","For the fiscal year, organic sales growth will be approximately 4% for the full year. This is comprised of volume growth of about 1%, negative mix of about 1% and pricing contribution of 4 points. We expect foreign exchange based on the current rates will be roughly neutral to sales growth for the year, leaving our all-in sales growth guidance also at 4% for the year. On the bottom line, we now expect core earnings per share in the range of $3.82 to $3.88. This compares to a prior range of $3.93 to $4.03, which did not include the impact of pricing controls in Venezuela. The new guidance range includes a negative impact of $0.04 to $0.05 per share due to those pricing regulations. The remainder of the guidance change reflects the pricing adjustments in several categories, the difficult economic environment in Western Europe and the deceleration of the U.S. market growth. ","The decision to lower guidance is always difficult. However, we have and will continue to make the hard, right choices for the long-term health of the business versus the easy wrong choices, which benefit near-term results but which hurt the long term. We could have waited to address the consumer value issues and the categories I mentioned earlier. We could have scaled back marketing support or trade spending behind new initiatives or delayed new launches to next year. These choices would have helped fourth quarter earnings but would have been harmful to longer term growth.","We now expect all-in earnings per share in the range of $3.63 to $3.74. This range includes the expected gain from the Pringles divestiture of $0.47 to $0.50 per share and $0.07 per share of net earnings from Pringles now classified as discontinued operations, Noncore restructuring cost in the range of $0.18 to $0.20 per share and $0.53 per share of noncore charges for impairments and legal items.","We continue to expect capital spending in the range of 4% and 5% of net sales, and we're estimating free cash flow productivity that approaches 90% for the year. We'll pay around $6 billion in dividends, and we'll repurchase about $4 billion in stock for the fiscal year. ","In summary, we're making progress in a difficult economic and competitive environment. We expect to maintain top-line growth momentum while further improving operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. We're taking the necessary steps to ensure brands remain competitive in certain category\/country combinations, and we are continuing to make the investments necessary to deliver our long-term growth objectives while increasing the urgency to deliver near-term improvements in our cost structure. ","As we look forward to fiscal 2013, we're building our budgets and investment plans with a balanced view of sustaining our critical investments for long-term growth and delivering high-quality operating profit and earnings per share growth at levels consistent with our long-term objectives. We'll continue to see a strong benefit from the pricing we implemented this fiscal year. The cost savings generated by our restructuring investments and productivity improvements will build as we move through next fiscal year. We'll have a full year of innovations like Tide PODS in the market, and we have a strong slate of new innovations and market expansions coming next year. ","In addition to these tailwinds, a few of the macro headwinds we faced this year should be less severe next year. For example, while commodity cost will be higher next fiscal year, the increase should be much smaller than we faced this year. Also, while we don't anticipate an acceleration of growth in developed markets, we do not expect them to slow down further. We will keep updating our assumptions on this macroeconomic factors as we finalize our forecast for next year. We plan to provide detailed guidance for fiscal 2013 at our next quarterly earnings conference call, which is scheduled for Friday, August 3.","That concludes our prepared remarks and now Bob, Teri and I will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman of Barclays Capital.","Lauren R. Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So in the press release, you guys mentioned particularly about the change to guidance to the fourth quarter commodity cost being higher year-over-year. And as I remember, the commodity cost getting easier was supposed to be a big part of the operating margin improvement that we would see in this fiscal year. So when I combined that with just how much more pricing you guys are taking than the competition, seeing your volumes flat globally and that's the implied guidance for Q4, I can't help but come back to the decision to really not participate in much -- in the way of hedging. It feels to me like you're introducing more volatility and less predictability in your business than may be necessary and then maybe the case for your competitors. So can you guys just comment on that, and your position around how to manage costs over time?","Jon R. Moeller","Yes, I mean, first, we will prioritize the management of cost in ways that are sustainable and enduring. And we do that by reducing -- by improving productivity and reducing overall cost so that we can absorb these cost increases. If we can do that successfully, that stays with us forever. A hedge only benefits us for the duration of the instrument. And as soon as the instrument expires, we're back to the same problem. So we need to be operating the business in a way that overcomes those costs. We're doing that 2 ways. One is through pricing, as you've mentioned. Our levels of pricing aren't that different, at least on a global basis from the reports that I've seen over the last week. I think Unilever talked about 4.7 points of benefit from pricing. I think Colgate talked about 3 unchanged benefits from pricing. KC talked about 3 points of pricing. So we're in the same ballpark as far as that. I know I'm not opposed to any hedging. And when it's appropriate and cost-effective, it's something that we'll do. But I'm very focused more so on long-term sustainable solutions.","Robert A. McDonald","Lauren, this is Bob. I think also it's important to note that the -- we're trying to change the culture of the Procter & Gamble Company to be much more focused on productivity improvement on a going basis. Even though we've talked about a productivity program, which is on track by the way, this is something that we're going to all be focused on going forward. So as we continue to grow, we create a company which is fit to win over the long term despite growing size. And that's a change for our company relative to our historic past, where we have tended to take big one-time restructurings. We want to continue to improve the productivity of the company going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Guys, so obviously, your share is lower in 55% of categories but probably much worse in your higher margin developed markets. And I just wanted to get your color on whether you think these 6 country\/category interventions address the root cause, I guess, of the broader share weakness in developed markets. And I guess, is your premium price positioning in what are still sluggish categories still the root cause? If not, what is? And what do you do from a bigger picture perspective?","Robert A. McDonald","Chris, we see the root cause in really 2 ways, and I think Jon mentioned it in his remarks. Number one is the pricing disparities, and we talked about the 6 category\/country combinations. Of the 6, 4 are in the United States and that's where the majority of the share loss was. We think we've corrected those. We're not going to allow competition to buy our share with incremental promotion or by not following price increases. The second cause, which also Jon alluded to, was in some spots, our innovation has been inadequate. This is particularly true in the Beauty category and particularly in North America. We've had some great innovations. Jon talked about the facial hair removal innovation on Olay. But the base brand needs innovation. And that's what we're focused on now. Jon talked about other innovations on Pantene, Ice Shine as being an example. Again, Ice Shine is doing very well, but the base brand needs better innovation. So we're working on bringing those innovations to market, particularly in the Beauty Care area. And I think that will alleviate the second cause.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of UBS.","Nik Modi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick question on the restructuring program. And I guess, Jon, Bob, if you think there's disruption being caused within the organization -- I know that was obviously a concern of the management team when you're thinking about doing this. Do you think that this is an issue? And what are you doing to try to limit the impact?","Robert A. McDonald","Nik, as we -- as I alluded to in my comments, we really see productivity improvement as part of our work, not as a one-time event, an episodic event. If we're going to continue to grow as a company, we think that we've got to deliberately work to improve the productivity of the company so that we can operate with the agility and the flexibility of a much smaller company, called a $10 billion company. And as a result of that, we have gone through the organization. We've looked at the way we work. We're changing the way we work. And with the changes in the way we work, we're also changing the organization structure. You've seen some of that already. We have half the number of vice chairmen, for example, that we had before. We have fewer vice presidents than we had before. But the change in the work is really necessary in order to have that agility and speed of a much smaller company. At the same time, we're very deliberate and clear on what the strategy is. You've seen some of that work about how we're going to get more categories into more countries, about how we're going to get a vertical price tier of brands and products in each category, which in many ways is an antidote to a recession type of economy. And we're working hard on that, as well as working hard on an innovation program to support all of that.","Jon R. Moeller","In terms of disruption, I mean, so far, I don\u2019t see it as being terribly disruptive. I mean, we delivered within our guidance range in both the top and bottom line, maybe not at levels that people would like but at levels that we were planning. And so in terms of being able to execute our plans, I don't see a conflict.","Robert A. McDonald","The feedback we get from employees in our organization survey that we run every year is they actually welcome this, that they feel like they have too many touch points. And so the feedback we're getting from employees is very positive. And remember, we're talking about an impact on 10% of our employees, not a higher percentage.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz of Deutsche Bank.","William Schmitz - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So here's a question for you. So if -- has there been a time in the company's recent history where the advertising ratio has increased and market shares have fallen? And then sort of the follow-up to that is -- I don't know how closely you follow those Kantar Retailer PoweRanking. P&G is still obviously the leader, but some of those metrics are down about 20 points over the last 5 years and actually kind of corresponds to the share losses. So how much was the retail execution issue with the share losses? And how much of it is that advertising ratio? Because I don\u2019t think I can remember a time when the advertising ratio was increasing and market shares came down.","Jon R. Moeller","First, just let me provide a little bit of perspective and then Bob can talk about the Kantar metrics. Globally, share is down, but it is down 0.2 points. So this isn't a big cliff-type event. Having said that, as we have said, North America is down about 0.6 point, and we're working to address that with the interventions that I mentioned. But I want to put the share loss in context. And as I said, if we -- if our pricing actions are effective in those 6 product category combinations, we will be back to share growth for the company. Bob, do you want to talk about Kantar?","Robert A. McDonald","Yes, sure. Bill, as you mentioned, we also received, obviously, the Kantar PoweRanking. And as you also mentioned, we did maintain our overall leadership position, as well as our leadership positions in most of the categories. We really value our work and our strong partnerships, and they often act as a catalyst to drive improvement across our competitive set. And while we're being recognized for our leadership in the rankings, we're certainly not complacent. We've taken all of the country\/category combinations from the Kantar PoweRanking, we've put together action plans to improve them, and we're looking to improve them with our joint value creation plans with customers. I also would draw your attention to the Advantage Rankings, which have come out recently and, again, showed us well in the lead, showed us in the lead across all categories. But again, we're going through it in a very granular way, looking at countries where we're not doing as well and trying to improve those metrics. We had some customer service opportunities that came out, and we're working hard to improve those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson of Citigroup.","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My question sort of, I think, follows up on Nik's question. And Bob, you used some words, I think, executing the restructuring and promoting productivity is kind of what you get paid to do or it's what your job is. But I guess the way I look at it, there are couple of things that have gone wrong at P&G over the last year, particularly the price gaps or managing those gaps. Jon, you mentioned, I think, market level setbacks. I don\u2019t even know what that is, maybe it's the Tide PODS delay. But it strikes me that from an execution perspective, P&G is not delivering. And Bob, I'd like your perspective on that. There are so many excuses, not our fault competition didn't follow the pricing, not our fault Venezuela changed, not our fault the developed market consumer isn't robust. But I still say, \"God, we're going into this massive restructuring program, how do we know this isn't going to be a replay of 2000 when the core business stinks and you're making huge changes to the organization?\" And I'd just say to myself, \"God, where is the mea culpa taking responsibility for the weak numbers as opposed to saying, not our fault, it's just really tough out there?\"","Robert A. McDonald","Wendy, let me be clear. It is my fault. I am the CEO of the company. I do take responsibility. I do take accountability. And every manager in the Procter & Gamble Company that was on the call would say the same thing. We do hold people accountable for results, and I take accountability for the results. We are working to improve this company over the long term. We've talked about the headwinds we're facing. We've talked about the steps we're taking. We will deliver. This is a company that has delivered over 175 years, and we will continue to deliver. And we will get the right leaders in place to deliver. And we'll put the right programs in place to deliver. We will do it. And I personally don't think that this restructuring program will get in the way of doing that. In fact, if anything, I think it will enable it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if we look at the market share performance since you guys presented at CAGNY -- and again, Jon, as you said, it's within your guidance range in terms of organic top line but at the lower end of expectation. Is there any thought in terms of how much of the savings that you need to invest back in the business? Has that changed? And I guess that leads to a general thought with all this promotional talk and everything else like that, is the cost of competing in these categories higher than it has been over the past couple of years? And is that simply because the growth rates have come down and so everyone's scrapping for sort of each piece of unit volume?","Jon R. Moeller","So first, in terms of cost. We've put -- we will have put $3.5 billion of pricing into the market this year. The rollbacks and promotion increases that I referred to earlier are about -- or between $100 million and $200 million of that $3.5 billion. So it is additional investment back in the business that otherwise could have come to the bottom line. But it's not significant in the grand scheme of things. The more significant thing is the $3.5 billion in pricing. And I think relative to the cost of doing business, there are 2 dynamics that are occurring, maybe 3. The first is, again, generally, prices are going up, which is a positive thing. And that's true across our competitive set. That's true across markets. Having said that, the dynamic that you point to, which is slow developed market growth rates leading to a need if the companies want to grow to build share, how does that manifest itself in the marketplace. It's manifested itself primarily in a good way, which is innovation-based competition. We see a growing number of new product launches, for example, on the part of many of our competitors. We do need to respond to those launches. And so that does temporarily increase the cost of doing business. But long term, innovation is good for markets. It's healthy for markets and particularly, some of the innovation at the premium end that we're seeing. So in terms of going forward, how much cost savings will we have to reinvest, that's something we're going to have to look at every day and every week. But I still expect us to be able to deliver our long-term earnings per share growth rates net of that investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Bob, it seems like you're clearly struggling with high consumer demand, elasticity, the increased pricing in developed markets. And I think, at least to some extent, that's driven by the fact that you operate at big price premiums in the product categories you're in, and that naturally creates some market share issues versus peers and a competitive disadvantage in this weak spending environment, and given you're taking higher pricing. So in that context, might it make sense to start to manage developed markets more for profitability than market share, particularly if you need to fund this emerging markets' expansion and hit your long-term EPS growth goals? Or I guess to put it more simply, gaining market share in this consumer environment doesn't seem to allow you to hit your EPS goals. So it seems like something has to give in terms of your focus.","Robert A. McDonald","My experience has been that if you're not growing market share, you're declining. And if you're declining, you're not too distant in the future going to go out of business. So I think in any business, we always try to grow market share. In fact, our goal is to grow our top line 1 to 2 points above the market. And we should be able to do that. We should develop the ideas and the innovations that enable thus to do that. And a 1 percentage point growth in North America or Western Europe is, as you would guess, a multiple percentage point growth required in developing markets. So these are still incredibly important markets to us. And that's why we're reacting to the price differentials that we see in the 6 category\/country combinations that Jon mentioned.","Jon R. Moeller","And in terms of being able to do that, both in developed and developing markets, and having the financial flexibility to make those investments while delivering earnings per share expectations is exactly the motivation behind the $10 billion productivity improvement program. We realize that the equation doesn't square currently, and that's the game changer that should allow us to get there. That's in its infancy. As you know, we talked about it for the first time a couple of months ago, but we feel very good about the progress on that and are committed to it for exactly the reason that you described.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","My question is in line with Wendy's a little bit. Do you think that this is purely a spending issue because the categories you are -- you flagged, basically, Oral Care, razors, et cetera, accounts for only 10% of sales. So what is happening to the other 90% of the portfolio, with the exception of Baby and Family, all the other GBUs are underperforming peers that are growing organic sales 5% or better. So to what extent you are really in a position of start balancing top and bottom line growth as soon as the fourth quarter, which is where your guidance has still imply? To what extent this execution is holding back growth? And to what extent you are going to be thinking whether you have the right GBUs' leadership and whether you should be looking outside Procter in GBUs that have underperformed for several years, like Beauty?","Robert A. McDonald","I mean, when I answered the question earlier, I said that there were 2 issues. One was pricing and one was innovation. And we're working on both of them. And when I talked about Beauty, I talked about the innovation program which we've been -- which we're working on, and we're bringing further innovations to market. Again, I believe that we can grow market share particularly behind innovation, which is our lifeblood. And I believe we can grow the top and the bottom line at the same time. As Jon mentioned, the productivity program is an enabler to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty of BMO Capital.","Constance Marie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Given the earnings shortfalls over the last couple of years, I'm wondering if the growth that you generated isn't a better indication of what the company growth really is as opposed to what the forecast and the guidance almost hope they would be. And then as the follow-up to that, when would you see the inflection point? When are you seeing the opportunity for the restructuring to start to kick in to produce better results than the shortfalls in sales and profits in some of your core businesses to ebb? When do you see that coming?","Jon R. Moeller","So first of all, on this question of should we just use the recent past as a more indicative indicator of the future, doing that would ignore, I think, some very important things. One is that will require an assumption of ongoing commodity cost increases of $1.8 billion a year. And that's not what we're assuming. We're assuming much more modest increases based on current market spot rates. It would ignore the $3.5 billion of pricing that we've put into the market that we'll get the full year benefit for next year. Those are 2. And that would ignore also the intervention we're making on productivity and cost savings. So those 3 things definitively change, going forward, much more -- not completely but much more benign commodity environment, the benefit of the pricing and the benefit of the productivity savings. And that's what gives as confidence that we will grow operating profit and earnings per share. You're starting to see some evidence of that in operating profit even in the last quarter albeit minor. We're talking about mid single to double digit operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. Those same 3 drivers are what will deliver that. And we're still in the planning process for next year, but our targets, obviously, are to get back where we need to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello of Oppenheimer.","Joseph Altobello - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to go back to the commentary regarding the deceleration in growth in North America. I mean, you guys mentioned macro, and the macro has been an issue for some time now. I would argue that at least some of the data we've seen had been better, moving in the right direction. So I'm curious, is there something else besides price elasticity? Are consumers not impressed with the level of innovation they're seeing in the categories? Are they shifting spending out of your categories to other categories? Is it something else that you haven't talked about? And then secondly, obviously, it's early for fiscal '13, but could you just give us a thumbnail sketch of where our hedge should be for the next year?","Robert A. McDonald","Joe, we have seen a deceleration in category growth in the United States since January, and that has shown up in the share reports and the other reports that we get. I think what's happening is, obviously, you've got a higher fuel price, you've got other macroeconomic headwinds, like housing and other things. I mean, you read about these as well as I do. But again, a reduction in growth in the markets is not an excuse for us not to be able to grow above the markets. Our goal is to grow 1 to 2 points above market growth. And that's what we're planning to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj of Sanford C. Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just one quick housekeeping question and then the real question. The housekeeping one is just if you could help us a little bit on Venezuela. It was an issue for you, not for anybody else. And it sounds like it's disproportionate to your exposure. That's housekeeping. But the real question is, and actually building on Wendy's, I think, very appropriate question, is that -- look, on this call, if you think about it, you have a bunch of investors who are choosing or not to choose to own companies, choosing to own or not to own companies. And I wondered how you explain to them, and frankly the board, that Unilever or Personal Care grew 10%, J&J skin in the U.S. grew 6.3%, Colgate grew 6.5%, Kimberly grew 6%, all organic, all with better profitability, supposedly not through price gaps because it sounds like that's a minor issue. And I'm not so sure you can use geographic mix as an excuse anymore. So I'm just trying to understand how long do you expect investors to wait? How long does your current plan have to work? How much patience does the board have? And look, you may say it's already working and I respect that. There are some signs of that, but your stock hasn't shown it and your results versus peers haven't shown it. In fact, your peers are probably going to step it up as well as you guys step it up. So I'm just trying to get comfort about that whole issue.","Robert A. McDonald","Ali, your -- the examples you mentioned were primarily in Beauty Care. And as I said, we're unhappy with our innovation program in Beauty Care and we have work to do. Obviously, we've underperformed in Beauty Care for some time now. We've worked to improve the innovation program. It does take some time, but I think you'll see sequential improvement quarter-to-quarter as we go forward in Beauty Care. We have reviewed this within the company and within the leadership of the company, and we're working hard on doing that. If you look outside the United States because primarily, a lot of the result -- a lot of the problems we have are in the United States, there are points of light, and Jon covered those in his prepared remarks. Nevertheless, we've got to improve the innovation program in Beauty Care and primarily in the United States.","Jon R. Moeller","And on the housekeeping question, Ali, we went out of our way at CAGNY to point out -- to point to the fact that this could potentially be an issue. We had no way to dimensionalize it because we didn't have the legislation in our hands. It's different for different companies because the price reductions that are mandated by the legislation are different by category. It's also different for different companies based on how they are choosing to respond to the new regulation. We took the course of action, right or wrong, as soon as the regulation was published to comply. Others may make different choices. And it's not hugely significant for us, but we thought it was important to point out just on the basis of ensuring everybody had the same information and on the basis of transparency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","William B. Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the blade and razor business. I'm just trying to understand the price change now. With Hydro being out for kind of the past 2 years, I don't think Energizer has really held up on being promotional and aggressive. What's changed over the past few months why you need to make this -- why are we finally being more aggressive in that market? And then just a clarification, did you say that only -- there were only 6 out of 1,000 price country changes, or just 6 that you've highlighted?","Robert A. McDonald","There were 6 where we felt we needed to go back and take corrective action, and those were the 6 that Jon talked about. The promotion levels of competition in the blades and razors category have been high and have -- but have accelerated as well. And that was the reason we felt the need to have that be one of the places that we try to repair the value equation for our consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gere of RBC Capital Markets.","Jason Gere - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess I just wanted to talk a little bit about innovation. And considering that you guys lead your broader categories with innovation, how do you think about setting innovation at the right price points, i.e. is it too expensive in this economic backdrop considering that consumer spending may not get back to where we were years ago? Consumers have made difficult choices to trade down. So I'm just wondering -- and not just in Beauty but just broadly as you look at the U.S. and Western Europe, how you're setting the prices out there and whether or not you feel that that's the appropriate measure at this point.","Robert A. McDonald","Right. Well, we -- as I said earlier, we believe in innovation. Innovation is the primary way we accomplish our purpose of improving lives. We spend about $2 billion a year in research and development. We spend $0.5 billion a year in consumer knowledge. The half -- the $2 billion a year in research and development is about 50% more than our largest competitor. We believe in innovation and we believe that that's the way we improve lives and we sell product and we make profit. The way we think about innovation is not that we just innovate for the premium tiers, or even not that we innovate for the premium tiers and dilute the product for lower priced tiers. We believe that we innovate for each discrete level of the price tiers. So while we're innovating on the high end in U.S. laundry with Tide TOTALCARE, let's say, which have price index of $1.60 versus base Tide, or Tide PODS, we're also innovating on Gain, on Era, which are brands that are priced significantly lower than Tide. So we try to innovate for each consumer need at each discrete level of the economic pyramid.","Jon R. Moeller","And I think, for the question of are there meaningful set of consumers that are responsive to the premium Tier innovation, there continues to be a strong response. Some of our best innovation, as measured by sales, have been in the premium tier, whether that's Tide PODS, albeit it's still early there, but Fusion ProGlide, Crest 3D White. And so we're not seeing an absence of consumer interest in premium innovation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley of Buckingham Research.","Alice  Beebe Longley - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I have questions about the fourth quarter and then separately on innovation. I'll give you the innovation one first. You've highlighted weakness in Beauty Care and the need to do more innovation for the base lines for Olay and Pantene. We've been hearing this for, I think, more than a year. Do you agree that you're too slow for innovation? And can you explain why you've been so slow? And can you tell us when we start getting significant innovation there? And then on the fourth quarter, we understand commodity costs are worse than you originally thought. But do gross margins still go up in the fourth quarter, the comp is easier. That's the first question on the fourth quarter. Also on the fourth quarter, will promotions take more off of sales than a year ago than they have been? And the third question on the fourth quarter is, will your add ratio be still flat for the year, or will it be up, and will it be up in the fourth quarter?","Robert A. McDonald","Alice, on the rate of innovation or the speed of innovation, certainly, we would always say that we would like to be faster than we are. If you look at the innovation process, we've shortened the time recently, for example, by using more modeling and simulation, which helps us speed the process of innovation. And we're applying those tools to help us speed the process of innovation in the Beauty and Grooming categories, as well as other categories. 80%, for example, now of our innovations have some form of modeling or simulation, which eliminates the need for the creation of bench scale prototypes, which speeds the innovation process. You will be seeing incremental innovations over the coming months. I don't want to disclose them because obviously, our competitors will have access to this information. But as Jon laid out, in the last year, on average, we've had about the same number of IRI Pacesetters, the largest sellers in the United States, as we have in previous years. We're not happy with that. We want to go further and we want to go faster, and you will see that.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Tim Conder of Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy A. Conder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'd just like to echo a couple of the earlier comments, Wendy and Ali here. The competitors seem to deal with the sluggish developed markets very well and very profitably. Yet as they use promotions effectively to maintain and improve margins, you've made your issues to maintain your share without rolling back the pricing or aggressively using promotion to push out material margin improvement. And it seems one of execution, you've got some innovation that -- in general, that you are getting paid for but broadly, you're not. And then maybe, is it too broad of a marketing focus on the feel-good versus the key core brands? Those seem to be potentially 2 of the underlying issues here. And then separately, more from a housekeeping ongoing prospective, with the restructuring, it would be very, very beneficial, I think, as we go forward each quarter to lay out \"Here's how much we did in restructuring, here are the savings for that,\" so that we can track the progress versus the benchmark of the whole program.","Robert A. McDonald","We're obviously working to grow share in developed markets and to do it in a profitable way. And I've talked about how we're going to do that. And again, the best way to solve this or to answer your questions or Wendy's or Ali's is to deliver the results, and that's what we're focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Mark S. Astrachan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'm curious about the commentary that marketing investment was reduced in the March quarter. Why was that? And then relatedly, the spread between price and volume has widened to the largest gap in recent memory. I guess the question is, how long is that sustainable? And what prevents you from, frankly, completely repositioning pricing going forward to try to stimulate volumes and sort of go to the opposite end of the spectrum? I know it's drastic, but what prevents it?","Jon R. Moeller","Well, first, on the marketing point, I'm not recognizing that point. We didn't decrease marketing spending in the quarter we just completed. So I'm not quite sure where that reference comes from, but I'd be happy to follow up. If there was a reduction, it was very minor, but there was no step change, for sure. And on the pricing point, I mean, quite frankly, I've talked about $3.5 billion of pricing offsetting $3.5 billion of commodity cost increases. I think if we can make it work, staying with that is a much better option than reversing all of that because it's much more pricing flexibility. As I mentioned earlier, we really don't, except in a few cases, see ourselves out of step with the balance of competition as it relates to the amount of pricing that's going into the market. And -- but again, where we lose significant share as a result of that, we will take action, as we have done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser of Caris & Company.","Linda Bolton-Weiser - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just another question on the topic of innovation. I guess I think of true innovation as something that adds unit volume growth to the category. You give the consumer an additional item to buy within the category, the way fabric softener was added to laundry many years ago and teeth whiteners added to Oral Care, et cetera. Can you give examples of -- I mean, it doesn't seem that really anything that's come out of Procter in the last few years is that kind of true innovation. And is that the way you think of true innovation in terms of being able to grow categories? And then secondly, on the mix, the negative mix that we've seen as a trend, it seems that that's more related to innovation than maybe -- it seems that there's been more a discussion of the geographic mix influence on the mix. And maybe more of it is from the lack of innovation. As we're seeing such negative mix in Beauty Care of negative 4%, can you maybe comment on, is there some way to quantify, is there really more of it from lack of innovation versus geographic mix? Or am I thinking of it the right way?.","Robert A. McDonald","Linda, in Jon's remarks, we talked about innovation. We think of innovation holistically. In other words, we think of every -- innovation as everyone's job, innovation in marketing, innovation in product. Jon talked about the fact that we've upgraded existing products, like Crest with Crest Pro-B Health Clinical (sic) [Crest & Oral-B Pro-Health Clinical] lineup, the new Bounty technology, Always and Tampax Radiant. But also, we believe in entering new categories. And Jon talked about the fact that we introduced Downy Unstopables, which has increased the size of the fabric enhancer category. We talked about Febreze car air freshener, which is increasing the size of the Air Care category. We talked about Olay's Smooth Finish in the facial hair removal area, which is a new and better product for facial hair removal. So we talked about ZzzQuil, which is a first entry for us into the sleep aid segment. So we do believe in expanding categories, and we do believe in this continuous innovation that even creates new categories where categories don't exist. And that's the kind of innovation that we need in order to grow our business over the long term and globally.","Operator","You're next question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst of Wellington Shields.","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields & Co., LLC, Research Division","I wanted to take another stab at the question about pricing. I'm wondering if in a world of instant communications and mobile apps, et cetera, it might become more difficult in the future to take pricing. How do you look at that?","Robert A. McDonald","Well, repricing -- pricing is one aspect of consumer value. There are lots of different aspects of consumer value. For example, I talked about a retailer, where I was in the store and the retailer was telling me their average transaction size was $12 for every shopper who shops in their store. And then we went and we checked the average transaction size for Tide PODS, and that retailer was selling the $19 size, which means consumers are seeing tremendous value in Tide PODS that's much more than just price. And we have proprietary ways that we measure that, so that we have a relatively good estimate when we go to market as to what would happen. We're also working in consumer applications and working in digital technology to make sure that we create a relationship with the consumer and let them know the value of our products before and when they're in the store.","Jon R. Moeller","I think that's our last question. I want to apologize because there were a couple or parts of questions that we didn't get to, either as a new caller got brought online or as we just didn't make it there. I want to be able to answer all of your questions, and so please don't hesitate to follow up with us and we'll do that.

Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. ","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business.","\u201cOrganic\u201d refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. ","Any measure described as \u201ccore\u201d refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. Our October-December results came in pretty much as we had expected, keeping us on track to deliver our fiscal objectives. All-in sales were up modestly versus the prior year, including a 3-point headwind from foreign exchange. Organic sales grew at 3%. Organic sales were in line or ahead of year ago in each reporting segment.","Coupled with 4% growth in the first quarter, this leaves us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal year. Sales growth was driven by organic volume growth of 3%. Organic volume was ahead of a year ago in each of our reporting segments. Pricing added 1 point to sales growth and mix reduced sales growth by 1 point. ","Consistent with the reported market growth and market share data you\u2019ve seen, October and November were relatively soft months for our categories and for P&G. December, on the other hand, was a relatively strong month for us. December organic volume growth was over 5%, with each sector growing at or above 4%. Organic sales were up mid-single digits. ","December quarter all-in GAAP earnings per share were $1.18, core earnings per share were $1.21, which leaves us on track with our plans to deliver 5% to 7% core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Earnings for all segments were ahead of a year ago, except for baby, feminine, and family care, due to foreign exchange. ","Foreign exchange was an $0.11 per share headwind for the company in the quarter. The year ago period also included a $0.07 per share gain from the sale of our bleach business in Italy. Combined, these two items constitute a 15% core earnings per share growth headwind for the quarter. ","Core operating margin was about equal to last year, down 10 basis points. Organic sales growth leverage and 230 basis points of cost of goods overhead and marketing savings were offset by foreign exchange and negative mix. Core gross margin was down 90%. Cost savings of 130 basis points and volume leverage were offset by geographic and category mix of 130 basis points, foreign exchange of 90 basis points, higher commodity costs, and higher manufacturing startup costs.","Core SG&A improved 80 basis points, driven by 100 basis points of marketing and overhead productivity savings. These benefits were partially offset by foreign exchange imps and targeted innovation and go-to-market investments. ","The effective tax rate on core earnings was 21.5%. This included a positive 1 point impact from the release of a tax reserve following a favorable outcome in Asia. This reserve reversal accounted for roughly $0.02 of earnings per share benefit on the quarter.","The net impact from all of the items below operating income, tax, interest expense, interest income, non-operating income, and supply chain, was a slight headwind to core earnings per share growth for the quarter. We generated $2.4 billion in free cash flow and remain on track to deliver free cash flow productivity of about 90% for the fiscal year.","As planned, we returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends, and we repurchased $1.5 billion in stock, bringing year to date share repurchase to $4 billion. Net, the second quarter came in pretty much as we were expecting, on both the top and bottom lines, leaving us on track to deliver our sales and earnings forecast for the fiscal year.","As we move forward, value creation for consumers and share owners remains our top priority. Operating TSR is our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit level, requiring sales growth, progress on gross and operating margin, and strong cash flow productivity.","Operating TSR drives focus on core brands and businesses, our leading, most profitable categories, and leading, most profitable markets. We\u2019ll begin to make more operating TSR progress as we move into calendar 2014.","Our strongest brands and business units and total company positions are in the United States. We need to continue to ensure our home market stays strong, and is growing. The actions we\u2019ve taken over the past two years to restore consumer value, expand our vertical product portfolios and horizontal regimens, and lead innovation have enabled us to restore value creating share growth in many parts of the business.","We still have more work to do in a few categories, and the competitive environment is intense, which leads to choppy results on a quarter to quarter basis, but we\u2019re making good progress. We have a stronger brand and product innovation program ahead of us in the U.S. this quarter. ","We continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets, with a focus on the categories and countries with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. This is where the world\u2019s baby\u2019s will be born, and where more new households will be formed. Developing markets will continue to be a significant growth driver for our company this year and for years to come. In October\/December, organic sales grew 8% in developing markets.","We\u2019ll continue to focus the company\u2019s portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create value. We\u2019ll continue to exit businesses where we determine that potential buyers with different capability sets can create more value than ourselves. ","Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we\u2019re continuing to push forward with our productivity and cost savings efforts. We\u2019ve made solid progress over the last fiscal year and a half. We have strong productivity plans for fiscal 2014, and we\u2019re working to accelerate some fiscal 2015 savings into 2014.","Versus a target run rate of $1.2 billion, we\u2019re now forecasting more than $1.6 billion of cost of good productivity savings this fiscal year, across materials, logistics, and manufacturing expense. This is up $200 million since our last update. Versus a going-in target of 5%, we expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We\u2019re up more than 8% fiscal year to date.","We\u2019ve now exceeded our 2014 fiscal year non-manufacturing enrollment reduction goals, only 6 months into the year, and have begun work to accelerate role reductions planned for fiscal 2015 into 2014. Our strict objective is to get substantially to our end of 2015 objectives by the end of 2014. This would put us close to, or within, the 16-22% reduction goal we\u2019ve established, 1 to 2 years ahead of target","And we won\u2019t stop there. We continue to identify opportunities to simplify and streamline our organization design. We continue to drive marketing productivity and effectiveness through an optimized media mix, with more digital, mobile, and social presence, improved message clarity, and greater non-advertising marketing efficiencies.","We expect absolute marketing spending to come in slightly above prior year levels, but marketing as a percentage of sales to decline. Importantly, the overall effectiveness and impact of our marketing spending will be well ahead of the prior year.","We see several more years of effectiveness improvement ahead, driven by new, more efficient digital and social mobile media and big opportunities to continue to improve the efficiency, precision, and effectiveness of our communication.","We remain committed to making productivity a core strength and a sustainable competitive advantage. We\u2019re equally committed to being the product and commercial innovation leader in our industry. ","We\u2019re currently bringing significant innovation to market in fabric care, including upgrades on all of our Tide Plus value-added liquid detergents; new extra-large tub sizes on Tide Pods; Gain Flings, a triple-chamber, single-load laundry pack providing Gain consumers with enhanced scent, better freshness, and more cleaning power, all with the convenience of a single-load form; scent upgrades on Downy Unstoppables and Gain Fireworks in Wash Scent Beads; Tide Oxy, a multipurpose stain remover that can be used in the laundry or around the house; and Tide Simply Clean and Fresh laundry detergent, specifically designed with the right level of cleaning and freshness for mid-price-tier consumers. ","We\u2019ve received strong retailer support for these innovations, overdelivering our distribution, shelving, and initial merchandising objectives for the launch. The Arial unit [dose] innovation in Western Europe is tracking well above expectations. We\u2019re continuing the expansion, launching in Italy, Iberia, and the Balkans earlier this month. Consumption trends on Tide Pods have remained strong, growing in the low teens fiscal year to date versus the prior year.","We\u2019re also launching a very strong oral care innovation bundle next month, including Crest 3D White Brilliance, delivering our most advanced whitening and freshness benefits in one toothpaste; Crest 3D White Luxe, which removes up to 90% of tooth stains in five days, and with our new White Lock technology, locks out future stains and microfine lines in the teeth; Crest 3D White Luxe White Strips, with new Flexfit Film, an innovation created with technology from our baby care business, that stretches and molds for a custom fit for more whitening coverage; our new Crest Sensor Relief Innovation, which delivers improved sensitivity relief, combined with Scope freshness; and Crest B, a new line for experiential consumers, including flavors like B Dynamic, Lime Spearmint Zest, B Inspired, Vanilla Mint Spark, and B Adventurous Mint Chocolate Trek.","In North America, our recent baby care absorbency, comfort, and design innovations are driving diaper market share growth. U.S. diaper share is up 1.5 points versus prior year, with particular strength on the Pampers, Swaddlers, and Luvs product lines, retaking market share and leadership for the first time in many years. ","We continue to strengthen our share position in the U.S. batter business behind the Quantum innovation and recent distribution increases. P&G batter value share is up 2.5 points for the past three months, to over 40%. ","In December, we started shipping Pantene in North America, with improved product performance and packaging. The shampoo and conditioner formulas contain a new Pro-V antioxidant complex, delivering clinically proven healthier hair with every wash. ","We\u2019re also leveraging Pantene\u2019s Shine Strong advertising that has received global acclaim for tackling gender labels and encouraging women to show their strength and shine. The advertisement has generated nearly 1 billion consumer impressions globally. ","We\u2019re expanding Old Spice into the rapidly growing North American male hair care segment behind a full array of shampoos, conditioners, and styling products, with Old Spice\u2019s most popular scent collections. This started shipping last week. Old Spice Body Spray is growing strongly behind the new Smellcome to Manhood commercial campaign. To date, the campaign has generated over 700 million consumer impressions, the vast majority of which have been free, through social media and mass media coverage.","Duracell\u2019s Trust Your Power advertisement has also gained high awareness online. It features Derek Coleman, the only legally deaf player in the NFL, and the barriers he\u2019s overcome by trusting his inner power. The U.S. advertisement has driven over 1.7 billion consumer impressions in just two weeks, since it was launched on January 10.","We recently launched our new commercial campaign for the Winter Olympics. The commercial program includes a balanced combination of single brand and multibrand executions. Our research shows stronger purchase intent is generated when individual brand executions are closely coupled with the multibrand execution. The Olympics ad campaign had generated nearly 1.6 billion consumer impressions so far, and like Old Spice and Duracell, most of these are earned or free impressions generated through traditional and social media.","These product and commercial innovations should contribute to strong top line momentum in the back half which, combined with productivity savings, should enable us to deliver our fiscal year objectives. Next, we\u2019re improving execution and operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably. We need everyone playing their position and playing it well.","Consistent with the customer service improvements we discussed last quarter, we were recently named the top rated manufacturer in China, our second largest market, as rated by our retail partners and both the Advantage Group and Kantar Retail surveys. These surveys reflect the quality of our customer business development organization, promotion plans, and customer service reliability.","Last, we\u2019re making strategic investments in innovation and go-to-market capabilities. Targeted R&D investments are enabling us to strengthen our near and midterm innovation pipeline. Targeted go-to-market investments will enable us to strengthen sales coverage in our fastest-growing markets and fastest-growing channels.","We believe that the focus that we\u2019re bringing to these four areas: operating TSR, productivity, innovation, operational excellence, along with targeted reinvestment, will enable us to continue to improve results, even as we work to address several remaining opportunities. We remain on track to deliver our 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line, and cash. ","We\u2019re maintaining our organic sales growth range of 3% to 4%. Achieving organic sales growth in the upper half of our target range should result in modest overall market share growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of 2 points, which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for the fiscal year.","We\u2019re maintaining our forecast for bottom line core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%, despite stronger headwinds from foreign exchange and softer market growth rates. We aim to make up the difference through productivity advances, which will primarily benefit the fourth quarter.","The fiscal year headwind from foreign exchange has continued to increase. We now expect foreign exchange to be a 7-point headwind to core earnings per share growth. As a result, our guidance now translates to constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 14%.","We now expect the tax rate on core earnings to be a point or so below prior year levels. On an all-in GAAP basis, we expect earnings per share to grow approximately 7% to 9%. This range reflects somewhat lower noncore restructuring costs in fiscal 2014 versus the prior year.","The second half earnings growth increase that\u2019s implied within our guidance is driven by foreign exchange and cost structure improvement. Foreign exchange was a significant headwind in the first half but will moderate in the second half at recent spot rates. We\u2019ll also annualize the operating impacts from last year\u2019s Venezuelan bolivar devaluation.","Manufacturing startup costs will annualize in the second half of fiscal 2014. Productivity savings and devaluation related price increases will build sequentially. As you prepare your estimates for Q3 and Q4, please keep in mind a couple of items. ","We won\u2019t annualize the Venezuela impact until mid-February in Q3. We\u2019ll had a full quarter of laundry and oral care innovation impacts in Q4. Productivity savings that are being advanced to offset stronger FX impacts and lower market growth will primarily benefit the fourth quarter. Also, pricing that we\u2019ll be taking to offset recent devaluations in some markets will take effect only in Q4.","We expect another year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion. ","In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we want to continue to be very transparent about some key items that are not included. The guidance we\u2019re reconfirming today is based on last week\u2019s FX spot rates. Further currency weakness is not anticipated within our guidance range.","We continue to monitor unrest in Egypt, which is a large business for us and a base of export for the balance of Africa, as well as unrest in economic instability in the Ukraine, though the situation has recently improved. Venezuelan price controls, access to dollars for imported products, and devaluation present risk, as do import restrictions, price controls, and devaluation on Argentina.","Finally, our guidance assumes no further degradation in market growth rates. Our first half results were in line with what we expected, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the fiscal year and make progress towards our long term growth objectives. We continue to operate in a volatile environment, with uncertainty in foreign exchange, some deceleration in market growth rates, and a rapidly developing policy environment.","Against this backdrop, we\u2019ve maintained top line growth and improved constant currency operating earnings growth. We have an even stronger innovation program in the back half of the year and savings from productivity improvements that will build. We\u2019re making targeted investments in our core businesses, most promising developing markets, and biggest innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving productivity and cost savings.","Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our share owners. That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and will be available on slides, which we posted on our website, www.pg.com following the call.","Our next significant investor event ahead of A.G. Lafley is the Cagney conference on February 20. We hope to see many of you there. I\u2019d be happy now to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara - Wells Fargo ","John, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the cadence of the quarter. I think you mentioned that December was up 5%. Can you put that in the context of sell-in versus sell-through? What was going on in October\/November? I think your shipments probably exceeded consumption by a reasonable margin in December. Why is that? How do you feel about inventory levels there? And then just if you can go through the same sort of cadence for the quarter for the emerging markets too, given all of the concern there, that would be great.","Jon Moeller ","You\u2019re certainly right in that the timing of innovation did affect the timing of shipments in the quarter. We\u2019re very comfortable with inventory levels currently, and offtake in January has been very encouraging. So we really do believe that there\u2019s strength behind the December numbers, and that that should carry through into the third quarter. ","In developing markets, there really wasn\u2019t a significant difference in aggregate across the months of the quarter. We continue to see some softness in market growth rates, but there continues to be very strong growth overall, between 7% and 8% in the quarter we just completed, from a market standpoint. And we expect that to continue through the third quarter as well. So what we\u2019ve seen in OND, while presenting some challenges, leaves us confident as we head into JFM. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.","John Faucher - JPMorgan ","Jon, as you look at the move to more local manufacturing, can you talk about the glide path that we should see in international operating margins over the next couple of years? It seems as though you exclude Russia and China, you\u2019re probably looking at maybe a high single-digit operating margin in your international business. And how long do you think it will take to see meaningful impact there? And then a related question, given the fact that you guys are still producing in some high-cost countries, and you\u2019re seeing this massive negative transactional impact, are you thinking now about potentially hedging transactional going forward?","Jon Moeller ","One of the big questions as it relates to glide path going forward on margins in developing markets, obviously is foreign exchange. But if you take that out, last year we were talking about growing profit ahead of sales growth. So improving margins on a constant currency basis in developing markets. We made pretty significant progress.","This year is really the same story. On a constant currency basis, we\u2019ll grow earnings significantly ahead of the rate of sales growth. So I really can\u2019t, because I can\u2019t predict exchange, give you an exact glide path, but we should continue to make progress quarter on quarter, year on year, on those developing market margins as we, as you mentioned, localize manufacturing, but even more importantly as we continue to bring innovation to those markets, value creative innovation, which allows us to mix consumers up, which is happening pretty encouragingly in places like Brazil and places like China, in Russia. ","So I said from the beginning that our developing market efforts, particularly as they\u2019re focused on the biggest opportunities with the highest chance of winning, should, over the long term, be a margin accretive endeavor, not a margin dilutive endeavor. And we continue to see that.","As it relates to hedging, we\u2019ll continue to look for all opportunities to operationally hedge. And obviously, the localization of manufacturing is part and parcel of that effort. In terms of financial hedging, we continue to look at that periodically as well. ","A lot of the FX impacts, though, frankly, are in nondeliverable currencies, whether it\u2019s in Egypt, Venezuela, Argentina, the Ukraine, etc., where there really isn\u2019t financial hedging option. And in many of the other markets, the interest rate differential is so high that even the cost of forward hedging gets pretty prohibitive. ","And as you know, all that that does is buy time. As those instruments expire, we\u2019re right back to the issue that we started with, and I\u2019d rather, where we have the opportunity, solve the issue real time, up front. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley ","John, beauty continued to drag down the organic sales growth number. The other divisions looked pretty solid. So I was hoping for more detail on how you plan to drive market share improvement going forward in beauty and when you think we\u2019ll start to see some improving share trends. And also, grooming, you mentioned market contraction in developed markets. Can you run through what\u2019s driving that? And what are your plans as the category leader to drive improved growth going forward, particularly on the innovation side? ","Jon Moeller ","We continue to make progress on our efforts to strengthen the growth rates in beauty. And many parts of the beauty business are growing quite well. Personal care shipments, for instance, increased double digits in the quarter. Strong growth really in all regions. Up double digits in China, midteens in central and eastern Europe and more than 25% in Latin America. ","Cosmetics we continue to do very well in. U.S. Cover Girl value share I think was up about 0.5 point in the quarter behind innovations like the Hunger Games Capital collection and the new Bombshell Volume mascara collection. Our antiperspirant and deodorant business continues to perform well, with U.S. deodorant value share up 1.5 points versus a year ago, driven by recent innovations on Secret, and as I mentioned, Old Spice.","And then we come to haircare. Many parts of the haircare business are doing well. Head and Shoulders grew mid-single digits in the quarter, including double-digit growth in western Europe and central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. ","Our biggest opportunity there is Pantene. I mentioned the innovation that\u2019s coming to market that we feel good about. We\u2019re feeling increasingly good about our overall equity and advertising campaign efforts, and as you know, as I mentioned, we\u2019ll also be expanding haircare into the young male segment behind the Old Spice brand. So we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re rounding the corner in haircare.","On skincare, we still have some work to do, and that\u2019s going to take some time. So we share the impatience that exists externally. We know that we have more work to do, but we are comforted by the progress that we\u2019re making.","On the question of developed markets, market growth and our responsibility as category leaders for market growth, the good news is that the developed markets are growing, albeit at a modest rate. It kind of oscillates somewhere between 0.5 point and 1 point of value growth per month. And within that, the better news is that where market growth is strongest in developed markets is in the U.S. and Japan. It\u2019s weakest in Europe. We are overdeveloped in both the U.S. and Japan, and so from a footprint standpoint relative to developed market growth, we\u2019re fairly well-positioned.","We absolutely accept the responsibility for growing markets, in the categories where we\u2019re leaders and in the countries where we\u2019re leaders. And increasingly, our retail partners are looking at us as partners in that regard, to grow their business as well. We bring innovation that does grow markets. If you look at what\u2019s happened, for instance, with Crest 3D White and some of the other innovations, we bring innovation that increases trips and grows market baskets. So it is very much a part of our focus. It\u2019s actually more important in many places of the world than share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citigroup. ","Wendy Nicholson - Citigroup","Just first a clarification. The 7-8% growth in emerging markets, less than 100 basis points of that I assume would be the benefit of new country or new category combination launches? So if you could just clarify that and make sure if that\u2019s a real sort of same-store sales number, or close to it.","And then my second question is, with regard to what AG has talked about, the sort of strength to grow, and I know you said you\u2019re looking for partners who can grow your businesses better maybe than you can, are you entertaining full brand divestitures? Or is there the possibility too of just sort of country category combination exits, kind of like what Kimberly\u2019s doing, getting out of diapers in western Europe? Is that the stuff you\u2019re entertaining as well?","Jon Moeller ","From a developing market growth standpoint, the vast majority of that 8% growth in developing markets that we posted in the latest quarter is, if you will, same country, same category, apples to apples growth rate. I don\u2019t know exactly, but I would guess that the impact of any new white space businesses is well below a point. So that should be a pretty good number and representative of the progress that we\u2019re making.","And on divestitures, historically, if you look at our efforts in this space, where we determine we can\u2019t create value, whether that is at a category country combination level or a brand level, we\u2019ve looked at other options. So in the past, historically for instance, we exited the family care business, the tissue\/towel business, in various parts of the world because we just didn\u2019t see, at that point, a financial structure and an industry structure where we could sustainably create value for our shareholders.","We did the same, as you know, in several categories recently, from pharmaceuticals, to coffee, to snacks, to water purification, and in some markets the bleach business. And rather than point to specifics, because as you know this is something we really only want to talk about when we have something to talk about, I\u2019ll just reassure you that - hopefully it\u2019s reassuring - that as I mentioned, everything we\u2019re looking at is through the lens of value creation and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s off the table.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank ","Just a follow up, what was the percentage of market share that the holding are gaining both in the U.S. and globally? I don\u2019t think I caught that. And the the growth rate in developed markets? I know you gave us the emerging markets number. And then my real question is clearly the March quarter has been a troubling one for P&G historically. So can you just give us some more color? I know you gave us some data points. And it seems like, as we look at the back half of the year, it\u2019s really going to be fourth quarter weighted. But I know you don\u2019t want to give quarterly guidance, but maybe your comfort level and kind of where estimates are now, the Street consensus, that would be very helpful.","Jon Moeller ","Percentage of business holding and growing share is down a bit from where we were last quarter. And that\u2019s primarily driven by two items. One is fabric care in the U.S., the other is haircare in the U.S., both of which are big businesses, which are growing share, and where we lost a little bit of share in the OND quarter.","Both of those categories are items that we highlighted going into the quarter as likely going to be experiencing a significant amount of competitive activity, particularly promotional activity, ahead of our launches in both of those categories, which are just happening now. So the decline in percentage of business holding or growing share is really driven by those two things, which we expected going in, and we\u2019re very comfortable that both of those businesses, from a share standpoint, will strengthen as the innovations hit the market. ","Just for perspective, if you look at, for example, Lever\u2019s percent volume sold on promotion in haircare, in OND, it was up about 6% versus the prior year. If you look at some of our laundry competitors, percent volume sold on promotion in the OND quarter, it was up over 20% versus a year ago. So again, these were things that we called out going into the quarter, things that we expected, and it\u2019s all ahead, encouragingly, of very strong innovation that\u2019s now just hitting shelves.","Your second part of your question, on developed market growth rates, we were about flat, slightly ahead, in developed markets. So the total is 8% developing, flat or just a little bit ahead in developed. And relative to the March quarter, I think your statement in terms of fourth quarter predominance is correct, and it\u2019s consistent with the various impacts that I was calling out in terms of when the different pieces are going to fall in place.","Having said that, I expect us to make good progress in the JFM quarter, on both the top and bottom line. But as you think about the modeling across the quarters, it will be fourth quarter loaded.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital. ","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays ","The first was just on healthcare. Very big volume number, and then weaker mix impact. So just curious if that was primarily because of the expansion of the personal healthcare business in emerging markets, or if there\u2019 something else driving it.","And then the other question was just perhaps a bit nit-picky, but I was reading through the release yesterday that you guys put out about Gain Flings, and it just struck me as a little bit too reminiscent of some of the innovation in the last two or three years, where it\u2019s like this massive bundling of benefits into one product. So it\u2019s Gain Flings with great cleaning power, amazing scent, plus Oxy, plus Febreze. It reads like it\u2019s like 10 people sat in a room and couldn\u2019t make up their minds which was the most important benefit. ","So I just would love some clarification maybe on the thought process, on why so much in one product, where the form should speak for itself, and how this is or isn\u2019t different from the innovation you guys have been putting out over the last two or three years in terms of that messaging. ","Jon Moeller ","The healthcare difference between the sales line and the volume line is really just category mix more than anything. And John can give you the details on that later today. Sorry, I don\u2019t have that level of detail right here in front of me. But that\u2019s primarily what\u2019s driving it.","On Gain Flings, you know, if you think about it, when we brought Tide Pods to market, which has been extremely successful, that was a multibenefit proposition too. It was not only the form, it was a better cleaning product. So it was an upgrade, from that standpoint, as well. And obviously nothing comes to market without a lot of work to understand what will delight consumers, and what they\u2019ll be willing to pay for that, and that certainly is the case here as well. Early both customer and consumer reaction to the proposition has been very positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with BoA.","Olivia Tong - Bank of America ","I wanted to ask about grooming margins, because they were up significantly year over year after being down in Q1. So going forward, is Q1 or Q2 more indicative of going forward? And is this due more to timing of some cost savings initiatives or promotions or innovation? Or is there something structurally different, so that profit growth will continue?","Jon Moeller ","It\u2019s hard to draw meaningful understanding from one quarter\u2019s worth of margin increase or decrease in any one of our categories. There\u2019s a lot going on out there, whether it\u2019s foreign exchange, whether there\u2019s pricing in some markets. The cost savings program is itself not ratable. It moves up and down across quarters. So I would encourage you to look more, call it 12 months, at margin trends as being indicative of what\u2019s happening there.","We\u2019re reasonably happy with our margins on that business. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re satisfied and we won\u2019t stop working, both on the productivity point and on the innovation point, to improve margins in a way that\u2019s value accretive for consumers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. ","Nik Modi - RBC Capital Markets","Just a quick question, if you could provide some perspective on some of the transitions that took place in leadership in R&D with Bruce retiring. Just curious on the replacement, any thoughts on changes in terms of processes within the innovation group. Any thoughts there would be much appreciated.","Jon Moeller ","Kathy Fish will be taking R&D leadership for the company. She has a long track record of innovation success and consumer delight across a number of our businesses and across the global portfolio. So we\u2019re very excited to see Kathy taking that responsibility. We just announced this recently. She and Bruce are in transition, and I wouldn\u2019t want to presume any changes in emphasis that she will choose, working a AG and others, to make at this point. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein ","A couple of things. One is on beauty. We haven\u2019t really heard much about what you need to do to fix Olay. And I wonder sometimes whether you actually need to acquire something in that business, because it really is your only skincare brand, to backstop that business. So I\u2019d love a perspective on that.","And then secondly, when we do see the beauty margins go up, I understand that a quarter doesn\u2019t make a trend, but at least to a broader question that I have, which is when do you expect that crossover point to happen as a company, where the productivity savings ramp up to above your investment level? And if you could talk about that crossover point as you see it going forward, in the context of some of the supply chain work you guys are doing internally, that would be helpful.","Jon Moeller ","The great part of the Olay story is that that remains an incredibly strong equity, with very high equity scores, very high net promoter scores, the highest in the category. So from an equity standpoint, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t do more work, but we start with a very strong asset. And really, from a product standpoint as well. We have a very competitive product.","But the work to do is in brand architecture, it\u2019s in packaging, it\u2019s in positioning the various properties in a way that is most relevant for consumers. And it\u2019s entering some benefit segments that we\u2019ve, frankly, neglected. And those are growing faster than the benefit segment that we\u2019re in.","It also involves ensuring we reach consumers at different ages, which is part of what we were trying to do with the Olay Fresh Effects item. Now, this is going to take some time, as I said before. But I would feel much more concerned sitting here if this was an equity problem or a fundamental competitive product problem, which it\u2019s not.","In terms of crossover point, back half, and the supply chain work, we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about it at Cagney. We continue to be encouraged about the opportunity to potentially replatform most of our supply chain in both North America and Europe to do really several things. ","One is, as you mentioned, to bring in savings, but also to get to standard platforms across the world, which allows for faster initiative expansion, to get closer to our customers with multicategory manufacturing facilities in a way that allows us to serve them better. ","And it\u2019s something that we\u2019re really just beginning the work on. I don\u2019t see it having a material impact, say, in the next 12 months. This is going to take a while, both to think through and to execute. But it should enable us to bring in a new round of savings in addition to the savings we\u2019ve been talking about over the last 18 months. But that\u2019s probably two or three years out. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","Thanks for the incremental color on beauty. I want to drill a bit deeper on laundry. A few questions. First, on Europe, it sounds like Arial Pods are off to a good start, but Nielsen data suggests you\u2019re still struggling in the market. So what are the offsets there?","Second, with the launch upon us, can you give us more detail behind the merchandising location and targeted price points for Simply? And lastly, what signs are you looking for to gauge when or if the U.S. market will be ready for the next round of compaction?","Jon Moeller ","Well, it seems like Ali has now trained all of you well. You all ask three-part questions. [laughter] First of all, on Simply, the price is ultimately the sole discretion of our retail partners. But generally, we\u2019re expecting that to be about 30%, on a list price basis, below current Tide. ","Compaction is something that we are always looking at as an opportunity, actually across categories, beyond laundry. And if you think about it, we\u2019re really actively doing that as we sit here, because the unit dose offering, whether it\u2019s Tide or Arial or now Gain, is the most compact form that exists in the marketplace today, and as more of the market converts to that, it has all the benefits of a standard compaction in terms of lower cost, better value equation for the retailer, better value equation for consumers. ","And in terms of the question on Europe, really where we\u2019ve lost a little bit of business is in liquids, where we\u2019re responding to heavy competitive promotion levels. So it\u2019s just a very competitive marketplace, which makes sense, as we bring in Pods and people are emphasizing the other parts of their portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty from BMO Capital Markets.","Connie Maneaty - BMO Capital Markets ","I am just going to have to question on Venezuela, and that is as we contemplate another pretty steep devaluation, has there been any change in the policy there about prices? Have you been able to work around any of the pricing restrictions? And do you see any easing of that coming?","Jon Moeller ","That\u2019s a very good question. Currently, there are price controls in place. That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be opportunities to take pricing. The level of pricing is reviewed regularly by the government, and we\u2019re obviously in discussions with them. And I would say that they understand the need for some level of pricing for both international and local competitors to remain viable.","Also, the price controls that exist apply to a portion of the portfolio, not to all. It\u2019s what\u2019s referred to as regulated items, where the pricing controls are relevant. And there are unregulated items where there\u2019s more pricing flexibility. So we continue to work to improve our financial situation in Venezuela, which starts off from a very attractive place to begin with, but your question is an appropriate one as we look forward. To the extent that there\u2019s more devaluation, will there be more pricing that\u2019s allowed? ","And that\u2019s just something I don\u2019t have the answer to today. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll be very transparent about and keep you updated on. And that question is one of the reasons I continue, as I talk about guidance, to hold that item out, if you will, because I have no way of forecasting exactly what the puts and calls are going to be. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante - Consumer Edge Research ","Question on the negative mix, again. I would like to ask it from a planning standpoint. Could you tell us whether the commitments that the [DBUs] presented back in August, when you created the fiscal \u201914 plan, could you tell us whether beauty and grooming are meeting their plans, considering this very negative gross margin mix? And if they don\u2019t, which DBUs are being asked to overdeliver in light of the reiteration of the corporate outlook for the balance of the year? Or does the plan assume that beauty and grooming are going to accelerate and therefore the negative mix to improve in the next couple of quarters?","Jon Moeller ","On a macro point, in terms of delivery versus expectation, we\u2019ve been talking about, on the top line, a mix impact of one or two points going forward, and this last quarter was one point, so pretty much in line with what we expected, as was last quarter. Each of the businesses has a strong commitment to deliver their plan that creates value for consumers and for shareholders. ","But equally, each of them is looking out for the company and is willing to help out where that\u2019s needed. As hard as you can imagine, going into a year, knowing exactly what\u2019s going to occur during the course of that year, particularly given the volatility in FX, some of the policy volatility, commodity costs, which are up more in some categories than other categories. And so that\u2019s an equation that gets constantly rebalanced. But I can tell you that no one in any category is giving up. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.","Joe Altobello - Oppenheimer ","Just wanted to go back to beauty for a second. I think in terms of the question from Ali, you mentioned that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s an equity problem, and I would probably agree with that. But is it a portfolio problem? Do you think that you\u2019re still missing that brand that you could sort of slide in between, let\u2019s say, SK-II and Olay for example, on the skincare side in particular? Is there something you could do there to address that? ","And then more secondly, in terms of overall beauty, if you look at the successful companies in this space, most of them are pure play. So is it a different mindset and culture that\u2019s really required to succeed in that business than, say, versus fabric and home care, for example?","Jon Moeller ","Thanks for reminding me of that part of Ali\u2019s question. Sorry that I missed that. In terms of additional equities that may be brought to bear in skincare, it\u2019s something that we look at routinely. It\u2019s certainly not something that we\u2019ve crossed off the list. But also, I think you shouldn\u2019t then therefore assume that \u201cwe need to make an acquisition\u201d in order to get skincare growth back to where it needs to be.","There are opportunities on both Olay and SK-II, and there are opportunities if we need to create equities or properties organically. But if you think about Olay, really that\u2019s a series of properties that were created organically, from Total Effects to Regenerist, to ProX. And so I think the question is a good one, and yes, we may need additional properties, whether under existing brands or new brands, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily therefore conclude that we need to acquire in order to make that happen.","In terms of the capabilities and skill sets that are required to grow a successful beauty business, if you just step back a bit here, over the last 20 years, Procter & Gamble, with its skill sets and capabilities, has built the largest and most profitable beauty company in the world. If you look at what we were able to do with brands like Pantene, like Olay, like Old Spice, like SK-II, like Hugo Boss, LaCoste, Head & Shoulders is another good example, that literally started out as very small kind of one-country, two-country, less than $100 million in sales businesses, and now are, in some cases, multibillion dollar businesses, category leaders, global leaders, in their categories, wouldn\u2019t indicate that we don\u2019t have the basic skill set and confidence required to develop and grow a beauty business.","Having said that, we are not arrogant in our ways and believe that we have all the answers. We have significant partnerships, many partnerships, externally, which give us access to other thinking in the beauty space, whether that\u2019s in the packaging arena, whether that\u2019s in the ideation and conceptualization arena, the equity arena. And we\u2019re also not averse to where there\u2019s very strong talent that needs a specific skill [outage], to bring that in from the outside. If you look at most of our design group, and that applies to both beauty and the balance of the company, was brought in from other companies, other situations, with the knowledge that that was an important capability, that we weren\u2019t able to source sufficiently internally.","So we will take any help that exits, wherever it exists, but I\u2019m pretty confident we have the abilities across our internal resources and our external partners to keep making progress in this space.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell from SunTrust.","Bill Chappell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","First, on the other Bill\u2019s question, I missed the actual percentage in North America and the rest of the world of held or gained market share. And then second, you talked about kind of being ahead of plan on the cost savings, cost of goods sold, restructuring and pulling some of that forward from 2015, yet obviously there\u2019s no change to your EPS guidance. Is that just conservatism? Is that we\u2019re spending more back into promotion and marketing with some of these launches? Or is that just FX is a little bit different from what you thought?","Jon Moeller ","Back to numbers, on market share, overall market share was about flat in the quarter. And percent holding or growing, I don\u2019t have the exact numbers, it was probably 55ish. So that\u2019s the market share numbers, both of which we expect will improve as we head into the back half of the year.","In terms of the acceleration of productivity savings, I\u2019d say there are two motivations for that, maybe three. The first is we want to make productivity part of our culture, and just like we never ask the question in P&G what is enough innovation, we don\u2019t like asking the question of what is enough productivity. ","We\u2019ll always be endeavoring to become more productive, and we\u2019re doing that for multiple reasons. There\u2019s the financial reason, obviously, but there\u2019s also speed to market, clarity of decision making, organization transaction costs, etc. So if we were in a position where FX was a tailwind, we\u2019d be looking to accelerate productivity savings into the current year and identify the next round. ","The second motivation is exactly as you described, which is that FX, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, has had a bigger impact, a significantly bigger impact, than we had been expecting. And as you know, at the margin, while market growth still offers ample opportunity for all the best competitors to succeed, it is down somewhat from what we were expecting when we went into the year.","And as you\u2019ll remember, when we started talking about productivity, this is exactly the kind of thing we were working to be able to do, which was offset, as one of the objectives, macro-level developments without having to compromise our earnings objectives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley from Buckingham.","Alice Longley - Buckingham Research ","I\u2019m thinking, based on your comments about what\u2019s happening in developing versus developed world, that trends and mix and price are quite different in the two regions. So could you take your 0% to 1% growth in developed markets and your 8% growth in developing markets and break those down into mix, price, and volume? And then as the second part of that, will mix and pricing get better do you think, in the U.S. in the second half than in the first half? ","Jon Moeller ","Let me just give you, and I think you can get the rest of it, the volume growth rates in developed, which was 1%, and developing was 6%. So the mix dynamics, pricing dynamics, aren\u2019t that different between the two, though obviously there are some differences between them. But those are the volume numbers. You have the sales numbers, and I think you can deduct the balance.","In terms of going forward, every problem is a significant opportunity, and any acceleration in the developed market business growth rates represents an opportunity to improve mix going forward. And clearly, to the extent we continue to make the progress we\u2019re making on beauty, as an example, that\u2019s an opportunity to improve mix going forward. And each of our businesses has its own opportunity to improve mix through value accretive innovation. ","And so while we expect that the developing, developed market dynamic will be prevailing - in other words, we still will have some negative mix going forward - there are many reasons to believe that the magnitude of that impact can lessen over time. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan from Stifel.","Mark Astrachan - Stifel Nicolaus ","I wonder if you could talk a bit broadly about expectations for level of competitive activity in the back half of the fiscal year, and how we should think about the split between gross margin and SG&A expense leverage to drive the operating margin that\u2019s expected.","Jon Moeller ","I expect that in an environment of growth but modest growth, that competitive activity will remain strong. But the biggest antidote to that kind of situation is innovation. The first half innovation program was fairly strong, behind the baby care innovation, the tissue\/towel innovation, batteries innovation, and the laundry innovation on a global basis, and that just builds as we go forward, with some of the things I talked about and frankly some of the things I haven\u2019t talked about yet. So competing on the basis of innovation is something that is much more comforting than not, and we\u2019re in a good position in that regard.","I think the other thing that oftentimes is missed, particularly in a developing market context, but also in developed markets, and it goes to the point of one of the questions that was asked earlier about market size, we really don\u2019t look at this as a zero sum game. There\u2019s enough growth for all of the better companies to continue to do well, and there are opportunities to grow markets, to create new businesses, to build markets. And think about developing markets, for example. It\u2019s really not about share, it\u2019s about market. And more competition tends to be accretive from a market growth standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy from CLSA.","Caroline Levy - CLSA ","Just going back to beauty margins, they seem to be as high as they\u2019ve been in many years in the quarter. If you could help us understand that. I know you said we should look at it on an annual basis, but a couple of quarters now where margins are actually going up, while the business itself is challenged. Is that a trend that we should expect to continue, the margin growth in beauty and grooming, beauty in particular, while you\u2019re improving things and working to turn around Olay and Pantene?","And then secondly, if you could just break out the volume growth in China. You said it was very strong, but if you could talk about your six major categories, if there were any standouts there?","Jon Moeller ","First, on beauty, I think the question behind the question is efficiency of support for the growth of that business, and we are comfortable with the levels of support. As I mentioned, we\u2019re working to increase the effectiveness and the strength behind that effectiveness of our advertising and marketing programs across the business, and that\u2019s obviously relevant in beauty as well.","And so it gets more difficult to look just at dollar trends and spending and assess sufficiency of support. So we\u2019re very comfortable we\u2019re supporting the new innovations we\u2019re bringing to market heavily. And there\u2019s no reason that, if that\u2019s the case, we shouldn\u2019t be looking to take productivity savings to the bottom line. It\u2019s a balance, always, and it will continue to be a balance, but you\u2019re starting to see, in those numbers, the reflection of very strong productivity progress, which is a good thing.","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Leigh Ferst of Wellington Shields. ","Leigh Ferst - Wellington Shields","You made several references to your digital ad spending. Could you give us a little more insight into it in the aggregate? Is it a third of your spending? And what kind of impact does that have on your impressions, and what impact will it have on your future spending on an absolute and relative basis, relative to sales?","Jon Moeller ","We are continuing to increase our presence in the digital, social, and mobile spaces, as it relates to marketing. The percent that is in those media, or channels, is different by category. In total, I think we\u2019re probably about or getting close to 30% of the spending being in those areas. It does offer, based on what we\u2019re seeing today, higher return potential. ","And that\u2019s why the shift is occurring. And you heard me talk in the prepared remarks about some of the dynamics of digital, social, and mobile media in terms of earned impressions, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re seeing higher returns in that space. And a huge number of those impressions were not paid for by us.","The other aspect of those channels and media is that it allows very effective and tighter targeting of a message to a consumer. If you think very simplistically about men and women, if you\u2019re advertising on TV in particular, depending on what shows you\u2019re on, that\u2019s going to everybody, and we can much more carefully target content to recipient in a digital environment. ","So I expect that will continue to be an area of focus as we move forward, but I really do think this is a world of and not of or, and we\u2019re really looking at comprehensive campaigns across media that consumers want to access. ","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.","Jon Moeller ","Thank you very much. John, myself, the rest of the team, are available at your convenience the balance of the day.

Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable.","Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and excluding tax payments for the pet care divestiture. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. Currency neutral refers to the equivalent GAAP measure excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes.","P&G has posted on its website, www.pg.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Now I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. January to March was another challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with significant foreign exchange headwinds, modest market growth and continued political and economic volatility. The currency challenge increased through the quarter with currencies in Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine weakening sequentially versus the dollar. Despite these challenges we grew cost and currency core earnings per share at a double digit rate. We grew core gross margin including and excluding foreign exchange and made strong operating margin progress up a 170 basis points on a constant currency basis. All of this was enabled by over 400 basis points of productivity savings.","Organic sales grew modestly up 1%, Grooming, Healthcare and Baby, Feminine and Family Care, segments grew 9%, 6% and 2% respectively. Organic sales were in line with the prior year in Fabric and Home Care due to the timing of innovation launches in North America in both the base period and the current year. The base period included pipeline shipments for the major Fabric Care innovation bundle including the Tide Plus upgrades and introduction of Tide Simply Clean & Fresh and Gain Flings, which led the 6% organic sales growth for the segment in the year ago quarter.","The current period includes the impact of trade inventory dry down ahead of the launch of new liquid detergent and fabric enhanced reformulations. Fabric Care consumption remains strong in North America with market share growth on both a value and a volume basis. Beauty segment, results reflects softness in Prestige Fragrance and mass Skin Care. Organic volume was down two points versus the prior year, developing market volume was down low single digits, following price increases taken to offset foreign exchange devaluation in several countries and adjustments made to correct trade inventories in Mexico and China. These adjustments had about a one point impact on the company\u2019s top-line in the quarter.","Developed market organic volume was down 2%, driven mainly by timing impacts associated with the April 1st increase in the Japanese consumption tax last year. Shipments in Japan were up 22%, ahead of the consumption tax increase last year and as a result were down mid teams in the current year quarter. This had about a half point on total company organic sales growth. Pricing contributed two points to organic sales growth and mix added a point. All-in sales were down 8% versus the prior year, due to an eight point headwind from foreign exchange and a one point reduction from minor brand divestitures.","We held or grew worldwide share on businesses representing about half of company\u2019s sales and on businesses representing more than 60% of sales in our home U.S. market. We continue to grow share on many of our category leading brands in countries where it matters most. Pampers tied, let Fusion and all was in the United States for example.","On a constant currency basis core earnings per share were up 10%, keeping us on track for double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. Including FX, which was an 18 percentage point drag on the quarter, core earnings per share were $0.92, down 8% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange hurts total $530 million after tax in the March quarter and $1.2 billion after tax fiscal year-to-date. They\u2019re forecast to be a $1.5 billion after tax hurt for the fiscal year. We\u2019re managing through the FX challenge with the combination of pricing, mixed enhancement and productivity cost savings and by pursuing opportunities on brands in countries and regions unaffected by FX.","Gross and operating margin growth improved sequentially versus the December quarter both in all and an ex-currency basis, driven by productivity savings. Core gross margin increased 20 basis points in the March quarter versus the prior year. This compares to a 20 basis point decline last quarter. Excluding the foreign exchange core gross margin was up 90 basis points. This compares to a 40 basis point improvement last quarter.","In the current period cost savings of approximately 250 basis points and 90 basis points of improvement from higher pricing were offset by a 150 basis points mix, 50 basis points of innovation and capacity investments and a modest increase in commodity cost. Core SG&A cost as a percentage of sales increased 50 basis points, excluding FX they were down 80 basis points. A 160 basis points of overhead and marketing savings were more than offset by a 130 basis points of foreign exchange impacts, 50 points of organization capability investments in R&D and sales and 30 basis points of other operating items.","Cost of goods sold and SG&A savings totaled 410 basis points, as we continue to accelerate productivity initiatives and programs and they deliver ahead of our objectives. Core operating margin was down 30 basis points versus the prior year including the FX. This compares to a 60 basis point decline last quarter. Core operating margin excluding the FX was up 170 basis points, 50 basis points better than the 120 point improvement last quarter. We expect even stronger margin expansion in the fourth quarter.","The effective tax rate on core earnings was 19.6%, half a point above last year\u2019s quarterly rate. This leads us on track with our guidance for a fiscal year core tax rate of about 21%, which is roughly in line with last fiscal year\u2019s rate. March quarter, all-in GAAP earnings per share was $0.75, which include approximately $0.07 per share for non-core restructuring charges and $0.10 per share of charges from discontinued operations, primarily an adjustment to [indiscernible] carry in balances to reflect P&G\u2019s March ending stock price.","We generated $3.6 billion in operating cash flow and $2.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow, with a 117% adjusted free cash flow productivity this quarter. Last week, we increased our dividend for the 59th consecutive year, up 3% where we paying a dividend for the 125th consecutive year every year, since our incorporation in 1890.","In summary, we generated modest organic sales growth in the quarter, constant currency core earnings per share grew double digits driven by 410 basis points of productivity savings. Constant currency gross and operating margins were well ahead of a year ago and we continue to build on our strong track record of cash productivity and cash return to shareholders. While we must and will manage through the external headwinds and market volatilities that is largely out of our control, the bulk of our effort is centered on driving significant opportunities in our control. Brands initiatives and product innovation, business and brand portfolio simplification, overhead savings and major supply chain productivity initiatives.","The company portfolio strengthening and simplification announced last August, strategically resets P&G\u2019s where to play choices. We\u2019re focused on winning with consumers and customers who matter most and channels and countries that matter most, with core brands and businesses that create the strongest consumer preference and the best balance of growth and value creation. We will eliminate 60% of the brands and the complexity they create, while retaining about 85% of sales and 95% of before tax profit. That\u2019s a good trade.","The new company will consist of about 65 leading brands where the size, the price and probability of winning near the highest in 10 categories that are structurally attractive and play to P&G\u2019s core strengths of consumer understanding, innovation, branding, go to market and leverage P&G\u2019s scale. They will enable more resources and attention on the biggest opportunities resulting in faster, more profitable growth. It\u2019s a focus portfolio with just seven categories representing 84% of the sales and 85% of profit. It\u2019s also focused geographically with the top five countries for each category delivering about half to essentially all of global profit.","Every brand we plan to keep as strategic, with a potential to grow and create value. Within these brands, we will operate with more efficient product line and skew offerings. Reducing that skew is 15% to 20% on the remaining portfolio over the next two years. The skews that shoppers want and consumers use. This continued [indiscernible] new brand and product innovation has the ample room to grow. We will create a faster growing, more profitable company that is far simpler to operate. We currently expect to exit approximately a 100 brand positions with a fair amount of the work already complete. To date we\u2019ve divested this continued or plan the consolidation of over 40 brands and about 40% of targeted sales.","We\u2019ve exited the Bleach business, Pet Care, Duracell, MDVIP, double our fragrance brands, the DDF and Naxzema Skin Care brands, Vicks VapoStream and the Camay and Zest bar soup brands. We\u2019re targeting to be in a position to have negotiated and announced the entire program or at least the large components as early as this summer. Roughly one year after our initial announcement and to have executed, in other words, closed program by the end of fiscal 2016. This will enable us to head into fiscal 2017 with a new portfolio fully enplaced.","Another significant opportunity is strengthening and focusing our strategies and business models, to win with consumers and in channels and markets that matter most. A strategy topic that has come up with increase in the frequency in recent investor discussions is, if leading brands are still relevant in a winning model and can still grow. We continue to believe the P&G strategy and business model, consumer insights and innovations that lead to consumer preferred products from brands that overtime are leaders in their categories is a winning formula for us, a constant, reliable and sustainable driver of balance growth and value creation.","Over the last five years our category leading billion dollar brands have been growing sales a point faster than our half a billion dollar brands and several points faster than our smaller brands. In most categories our leading brands have leading equities and that promote our scores. They\u2019re brands that retailers want and need in their stores because category leading P&G brands, household penetration and reach drive store traffic. And their purchase frequency and modest price premium drive basket size.","Premium brands and product innovation grow categories. These large brands are platforms for innovations, which can be commercialized far more effectively and more profitably and could be done on smaller ones that typically earn disproportionate amount of category profit and create disproportionate amount of category value. A good example is Pampers, our largest brand with $10 billion in annual sales. Pampers is growing at a 5% pace over the past three years. In the largest market the United States, Pampers is driving category value growth of 3%, reversing a multi-year decline caused by the decline in birth rates in both competitor and trade price discounting. P&G\u2019s U.S. diaper share is up at over 90% of customers, widening our margin of category value share leadership to 9 points.","The premium priced [indiscernible] line is on track to reach over $750 million in sales this fiscal year up more than 30% versus the prior year, allows us growing in the mid-tier with sales at mid single digits this fiscal year. We\u2019ve built the leading baby diaper business in the U.S. and in the world without a consumer preferred pant style diaper. We recently started the roll out of our new pampers pants designed to provide exceptional dryness and skin comfort in an underwear like design. Achieving fair share of the global pant market represents another $2 billion sales growth opportunity.","Another good example is Tide, our second largest brand at about $5 billion in sales. Tide has also been growing ahead of category growth rate building share. In the March quarter of last year, we introduced a strengthened fabric care brand and product line that significantly broadened consumer appeal. We offered shoppers a full range of brands and products priced from above $0.12 to $0.28 a laundry load including broadened pod offerings [ph], new and approved liquid detergent options and Tide Simply Clean and Fresh, a preferred brand of product for many consumers interested in good basic cleaning at attractive everyday value. In addition, we focused on trading in new to the category consumers to Tide, with new washing machine buyer, a new household formation programs. More consumers traded in and traded up and traded down. In fact, Tide household penetration is up more than 200 basis points for the first time in several years. We recently hit an all-time record high U.S. laundry detergent value share of 60%. Tide now holds a 40% value share of U.S. laundry detergents, with brand equity and net promoter scores as strong as they\u2019ve never been.","Gain is the number two brand in the U.S. detergent category and over a 50 in the share. Both of these leading brands have grown market share over the past 12, 6 and 3 month periods. The Tide and Gain brands have provided a broad platform for unit-dose innovation. They\u2019re trusted leading brands that consumers are willing to try their new product offerings. It would take a lot longer and cause a lot more to generate trial of pods [ph] for the significantly smaller brand or across the portfolio of several brands. Tide Pods of Gain Flings have reached a combined value share of over 10% of the US laundry market and P&G share of the Unit Dose segment is nearly 80%. We continue to expand Pods around the world leveraging another multi-billion dollar brand Ariel. We expect our Unit Dose products alone to reach $1.5 billion in sales this fiscal year.","Downy along with its sister brand Lenor is another multi-billion dollar franchise in the fabric care category. It\u2019s been growing at a high single digit rate over the past three years, driven mainly by the success of our scent beads innovation. Scent beads were a new product for consumers to add to their laundry regiment. We could have tried to launch them with a new brand. We chose instead to leverage the strong equity of Downy and Lenor along with Gain and Bounce to commercialize this new innovation. We launched Downy Unstopables in the U.S. about four years ago. Since then, scent beads have grown to 17% of sales in the fabric enhancer category and the category has sustained 3% growth. P&G\u2019s big brands have earned nearly an 80% share of the segment.","The largest male and female grooming brands - Gillette, Fusion and Venus have proven to be huge platforms for blade and razor innovation. The original Fusion razor launched in January 2006 is still P&G\u2019s fastest brand to reach $1 billion in sales. We\u2019ve continued the growth of Fusion with the ProGlide innovation in 2010 and the big obvious and preferred flexible innovation last year. Fusion value share of male razors is tracking in the high 50s and is up 2 points from last year. The flexible razor handle innovation is translated into share growth on cartridges. Fusion value share of male cartridges is up more than 2 points versus a year ago. We\u2019ve put 2 million Fusion flexible razors into the hands of men in the U.S. in less than a year since launch and we\u2019re now extending the breakthrough razor innovation to Venus, the market leading female razor brand with Venus Swirl, which began shipping in February.","Early consumption results are very strong in less than three months since launch. We\u2019ve sold over a million Swirl razors in the US and Venus\u2019s value share female razors was up more than 10 points nearly 65% in March, the first four month Venus Swirl was available. These new innovations from Gillette have helped reverse the declining value trend, market value trend in the U.S. blades and razors improving year-on-year growth rate by 3 points versus the 12 months prior to the flexible launch. Consumers significantly prefer these better performing products. The market leading consumer trusted Fusion and Venus brands are driving awareness, trial and share results from new innovations that will be more difficult for a new smaller brand to achieve.","We have taken a similar approach in the female incontinence category, leveraging our multi-billion dollar Always brand to enter this $7 billion faster growing global category. We began shipments of Always Discreet in the UK in July and the U.S., Canada and France in August. In the UK, the adult incontinence category is growing double digits, roughly 50% faster since our entry. The U.S. category growth rate has also more than doubled to around 9%, with P&G value share exceeding 10% in the most recent four week period. We\u2019ve continued the expansion of Always Discreet with launches into Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with more European markets coming soon.","A few of our leading brands are not growing like we know they can. We\u2019re bringing the same strategic focus in operating discipline to these brands that we have in the ones I\u2019ve just mentioned. Ensuring the brand strategies and business models are aimed at delighting the target consumer, building strong pipelines and portfolios of consumer meaningful product innovation, ensuring skew assortment and brand presence are attractive and easy to shop at shelves and ensuring that marketing and sales programs persuasively convey the value in relevant to our brands and product benefits to consumers.","Another opportunity directly in our control is productivity. We\u2019ve made very good progress and have a lot of runway remaining. We have significantly accelerated and will significantly exceed the cost savings and overhead enrollment goals we set three years ago. We\u2019re driving cost of good savings well above the original target run rate of $1.2 billion per year, with $1.6 billion of savings this fiscal year. We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by 5% this year. This will bring cumulative as per year manufacturing enrollment reduction to 15% including new staffing necessary to support capacity additions. On a same site basis, enrollment was down nearly down 20% over this past three years enabled by technology in our integrated work systems approach.","We expect to start up at least eighteen new plans or modules in the developing markets in the next few years. This will not only help our foreign exchange exposure, but will drive manufacturing, transportation and customs and duties saving. As we start up these new sites, we have opportunities to apply technology and automate in an affordable way and to close a couple and integrate further with supplier delivering additional manufacturing efficiencies. In developed markets, we began work on one of the biggest supply chain redesigned in the company\u2019s history. We\u2019re designing the supply chain to accelerate consumer preferred products in the market and to make industry with them in both the customer service preferred and cost advantage way.","Supply chain transformation began with the distribution network in the United States consolidating customer shipments in the fewer company distribution centers. These distribution centers are strategically located closer to key customers and key population centers enabling 80% of the company\u2019s business to be within one day at the store shelf and the shopper. All six of the new distribution and mixing centers are up and running, all on or ahead of schedule. We expect to complete the conversion out of legacy [ph] occasions this year. In addition to lower cost, this transformation will allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory levels while improving service in on shelf availability.","In February we announced that we will be constructing a new multi-category manufacturing facility in West Virginia, the next step in the North American supply chain redesigned. We\u2019ve taken the first steps in the transformation of our European supply chain. We recently announced the consolidation of distribution centers in France and the UK and the consolidation of manufacturing for some homecare products into our plant in Italy. We see a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation opportunity from the global supply chain reinvention effort. We\u2019re targeting to build $400 million to $600 million in annual cost savings in over five years and are expecting top line benefits for more effective customer service and reduction of out of stocks [ph]. This value and these savings are incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we originally communicated are on track to exceed.","Through March, we\u2019ve reduced non-manufacturing our overhead enrollment by over 19%, nearly doubled the 10% reduction we initially envisioned when we launched our restructuring program. We continue to evolve the organization design so that it is business focused starting with consumers and costumers and so that it is simpler, more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We\u2019ve organized around industry based sectors, we\u2019re streamlining and de-duplicating the work of business units and selling operations. We\u2019ve consolidated four brand building functions into one. Each of these changes reduces complexity and each creates clear accountability for performance and results.","A more focused portfolio of brands of businesses will enable further organization changes, which will be close to the high end of our estimated 16% to 22% non-manufacturing enrollment reduction range by the end of this fiscal year, more than a year ahead of plan with additional opportunity remaining. As a result we\u2019re increasing our overhead enrollment reduction target to 25% to 30% excluding divestitures by the end of fiscal 2017, reflecting additional opportunities we see.","The third cost area where we continue to significant savings opportunity is marketing. By following the consumer, we\u2019re improving marketing spending effectiveness and efficiency to deliver more with less. We\u2019re shifting more advertising to digital media, social, video and mobile, we\u2019re just working, so we\u2019re just spending more of the time. One non-media cost area that offers significant opportunity is agency spending, which includes fees and production cost for agencies we use for advertising, media, public relations, packers design and development against raw materials. We plan to significantly simplify and reduce the number of agency relationships and the cost associated with the current complexity and inefficiency, while upgrading the agency capability to improve creative quality and communication effectiveness.","We\u2019ve seen opportunity for up to $0.5 billion in cost savings in this area, along with stronger communication to consumers across all touch points. These efficiencies are enabling us to maintain strong media waves, despite the cost pressure we\u2019re facing from foreign exchange and to reinvest in all elements of the marketing mix to improve our positions and support new innovations. Like Always Discreet, Fusion FlexBall, Venus Swirl, Downy Unstopables and Tide, Gain and Ariel Unit Dose detergents. ","Productivity driven cost savings continued to be a key enabler of our efforts to strengthen profitability in developing markets. Cost and currency earnings grew two times faster than sales in the wealthy markets in 2013, four times faster than sales in 2014 and are forecast to grow six times faster than sales this fiscal year. Over those three years we\u2019ve grown developing market constant currency earnings 13%, 28% and 27% respectively. In total we\u2019re forecasting developing market margins including FX to be up about 40 basis points for the year. We\u2019re focused on driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Disciplined working capital management, stronger execution of our supply chain financing program and a scarcity mentality in capital spending, we\u2019ll continue to drive strong cash flow results. With that let me turn to guidance.","As we look to the April-June quarter, productivity savings should continue to grow. The benefits from portfolio strengthening and simplification should continue to build. Oil based commodity cost should become a tailwind and additional foreign exchange related pricing will kick in. With just one quarter remaining, we now expect organic sales growth of low single digits for the fiscal year. Pricing should be a significant contributor to sales growth again in the fourth quarter, which should more than offset pressure on unit volume growth. FX will continue to be a headwind and we will continue to invest in category leading established brands like Pampers, Tide and Gillette and product introductions like Always Discreet and Venus Swirl in R&D for future innovation and sales coverage and effectiveness and in capabilities and people that will enhance our chances of success in the near mid and long-term.","We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for double digit constant currency core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year, we expect foreign exchange to have about a 13 point impact on core earnings per share growth for the year. We\u2019re maintaining our core earnings per share guidance range of in line to down and low single digits versus last year\u2019s core earnings per share of $4.09. With the current foreign exchange outlook we expect to be towards the lower half of this guidance range consistent with analyst consensus estimates. Our forecast in all-in sales to be down 5% to 6% for the fiscal year, this includes the 6 to 7 point negative impact from foreign exchange and a one impact from minor brand divestitures.","We expect all-in GAAP earnings per share to be down 21% to 22% versus the prior fiscal year. This includes approximately $0.83 per share of non-core cost, primarily from $0.63 per share of non-cash adjustments that carry in values on the Duracell business and $0.20 per share of non-core restructuring charges. As you construct your fourth quarter earnings per share model, keep in mind that several of the minor brand divestitures I mentioned earlier are expected to close in the fourth quarter, altogether works back in about $0.04 per share of non-operating income gains in core earnings per share versus the prior year. Reflecting the same for activity focus for bringing the cost savings, we\u2019re now forecasting a 100% adjusted free cash flow productivity, above prior guidance of at least 90%.","The enablers of this strong cash productivity include, improved results on payables, including continued progress on our supply chain financing program and steady improvement on inventory management. We\u2019re maintaining our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We plan to return cash to shareholders through dividend payments of more than $7 billion and share repurchase of approximately $5 billion. This guidance range assumes mid April spot rates for foreign exchange through this significant currency weakness including Venezuela is not anticipated within this guidance range. Our outlook is based on current market growth rates, which we are monitoring closely especially in markets where we\u2019re taking large price increases to offset currency impacts.","We also continue to monitor on rest of the several markets in the Middle East, Russia and the Ukraine and we continue to closely monitor markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where pricing controls, import restrictions and access to dollars present risk. On the flip side our guidance does not reflect some potential tailwinds. Our results could improve if currencies ease, if markets begin to expand in a sustainable way or if U.S. economic growth accelerates. Stepping back, we\u2019re continuing to invest in our brands and products and in critical company capabilities that will enable much better consumer and customer responsiveness with systems that are more agile, faster, better and cheaper.","We continue to invest strategically in additional capacity for critical developing market and we continue to rationalize our manufacturing processes to like common, simpler and more globally standard making the packing platforms, support accelerated product innovation and a lower cash, capital and operating cost. We continue to evolve the organization designs, so that it is business focused, starting with consumers and customers, simpler, more effective, more responsive and more efficient. We continue to invest selectively in sales coverage and merchandize into improved execution for shoppers and stores and online. We continue to invest selectively in product innovation technologies and product initiative acceleration. We\u2019re improving our digital and ecommerce capabilities and are reinventing in our supply chain.","Through this transformation we\u2019re creating a more in touch, agile, coordinated and integrated organization that puts winning with the customer first. We\u2019re sharpening our strategies and business models who are operated in executing with more consistency. These are the choices and the capabilities that will enable balanced growth and value creation in the mid and long term as we work our way through the currency devaluations in the short term.","That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder business segment information is provided in your press release and available in slides, which will be posted on our website www.pg.com following the call.","I would be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Bill Schmitz - Deutsche Bank.","Bill Schmitz","Jon, good morning. Can you just talk about the first, the way this would [ph] impact the strong dollar. So what\u2019s going on in some of the emerging markets or some of the big price increases you take and then you look at some of the [indiscernible] in the U.S. and it\u2019s clearing categories like shampoo, where like your percentage of sales in ACB is massively spiking. L'Or\u00e9al is talking about seeking revenge, Henkel is launching Priscilla [ph] exclusively at Wal-Mart, so can you just like talk about what that has relative to your expectations in kind of how you plan to [indiscernible] that going forward? Thanks. ","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Bill. First I\u2019d say, it\u2019s still relatively early in the development of whatever that occurs here, but so far markets have held up fairly. As I said it\u2019s pretty really, so we really won\u2019t know the impacts in markets like Russia, Bill, the next quarter or the quarter after. Like you\u2019re seeing from several of the companies in the industry that are responded, in the last quarter the Russian market was actually up as they anticipated price increases come in. So again we have stream of second leg there. What I would broadly is that - and I\u2019ll get to the U.S. in a second, but in developing markets those currencies have devalued not just versus the dollar, but also versus the euro. If you take the case Russia, which I walked through in some detail on the last call, there is every reason for both local competitors and multinational competitors to be pricing in many of these markets and that\u2019s generally might be at early days what we\u2019re seeing.","As it relates to the overall promotional environment, competitiveness, et cetera and reflecting specifically on the U.S., if we look at the percentage of volume that was sold on promotion in the January to March quarter, it indexes at a 100, so is identical to last year and if you look at it sequentially quarter-to-quarter there is very little change. That doesn\u2019t mean that it couldn\u2019t change, but that\u2019s the data thus far and that\u2019s consistent with the dynamics in our own business. Obviously by category, you mentioned hair care. We may see some more promotion in one quarter or another. There is obviously promotion as competitors and ourselves introduce new products and are trying to generate trial of those items. But to date there is nothing from either a developing market standpoint or developed market standpoint that would indicate systemic change.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.","DaraMohsenian","Hey good morning.","Joe Moeller","Hi Dara.","DaraMohsenian","So I just wanted to talk a little bit about EPS guidance and clearly you\u2019re keeping the EPS guidance here despite the FX head and organic sales coming in are now expected to come in a bit below, which you originally expected. Do you think you are stretching the organization here to hit these EPS targets? It seems like every year we\u2019ve got this hockey stick in Q4 earnings. You\u2019ve now got some gains coming through Q4 earnings and Q4 add spend has been down over the last few years and I know a lot of that is the external environment clearly macros are working against you, but I\u2019m just wondering if there is a thought process as you look at the next year in the earnings guidance that given some of this external volatility and some of the internal issues you might need to provide yourself more cushion room when you look at guidance versus what has been the case over the last few years here. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So you make a couple of good observations there Dara, let me try to address them holistically. In terms of forecast and guidance we\u2019re obviously into that and more specifics in August. We\u2019re just in the middle of our prep season right now. If all of us know amount of cushion that you can build in that overcomes this $1.5 billion of after tax foreign exchange cost the majority of which we\u2019re not anticipated based on spot markets as we went into the year and expected our budgets last year. But that doesn\u2019t mean, I agree with you point that we need to provide a sufficient room to invest in the business and frankly we\u2019ve not pulled off in that regard. We have continued to invest, as I tried to make clear in my remarks, in certain parts of the organization both R&D and sales, we continue to invest in our brand and product platforms. We continue to invest in the redesign of our supply chain. We\u2019ve continued to invest in new product launches and that\u2019s clearly going to continue through next quarter. I mean, we\u2019re just in the first quarter launches of things like Venus Swirl and Always Discreet and they had received full support. As well, for instance the laundry innovations that I briefly mentioned in the opening remarks.","So what allows us if FX is going to continue to be a headwind and we\u2019re going to continue to invest, which we are, what allows us to deliver the fourth quarter number that as you rightly point out will be materially better than the first three quarters. We will have as I mentioned commodity cost tailwinds. We will have the full benefit of this year\u2019s productivity savings. Pricing for some of the currencies will begin to kick in. There will be a minor impact as we noted on a minor investor gains [ph]. But it\u2019s those items - look at the 410 basis points of productivity savings in this quarter and how we continue to invest in all the things I talked about. It\u2019s a continuation of that that should allow us to deliver.","Philosophically I have no difference, I\u2019m completely aligning to what you\u2019re suggesting in terms of how we construct plans and budgets and I think our current plan of budget is constructed that way. Recall in the middle of the year we took earning per share guidance down. So we\u2019re not a slave to that. As I\u2019ve said many times, if I\u2019ve proven anything over the last six or seven years, it\u2019s that I\u2019m not constrained by guidance. So we\u2019ll continue investing, but we\u2019ll continue to deliver productivity savings as well and we\u2019re hopeful that we invest in right amounts of those in the top line. We\u2019ll get both the top-line and bottom-line growing at very attractive rates.","Operator","We will now move on to John Faucher of JPMorgan.","John Faucher","Thanks. Jon, can you talk a little bit about gross margin. You\u2019ve delivered gross margin expansion a couple of times now despite pretty weak top-line it seems like we might be seeing sort of one off mixed benefits from that standpoint in terms of less emerging markets or potentially grooming being better that\u2019s driving that. So can you talk to us about sort of the progression on gross margin as we look at over the next couple of quarters and do you need sort of one off things to happen within those quarters in order to get there? And what do you think is the rate of benefit coming from local manufacturing particularly in terms of lessening the mixed impact overtime? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","So the biggest driver of gross margin by far - were the productivity savings of 250 basis points and that\u2019s not one time. It doesn\u2019t rely on certain categories growing faster than others. That\u2019s there, we\u2019ll maintain our increased path and I expect gross margin to continue to improve next quarter which will make it I think three quarters in a row, which again is some indication of the systemic improvement there. There was some benefit as you rightly mentioned from mix, which is frankly the developing and developed markets growing at closer rates to each other and if developing markets were to accelerate that mix benefit would be slightly \u2013mix hurt [ph] would be slightly increased.","In terms of the benefit of local manufacturing that continues to build. It\u2019s part of the 250 basis points. I actually don\u2019t know exactly how that breaks out in terms of basis point improvement, but John and Katie [ph] can help you with that. But it\u2019s significant and as I mentioned we\u2019re making very good progress on developing market margins through that and other dynamics including positive mix developments as those market in some cases premiumlize [ph] and as I said, we\u2019re growing constant currency earnings ahead of constant currency sales growth 2X three years ago, 4X last year, 6X this year and that\u2019s a trend that should continue.","Operator","You will now take a question from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Olivia Tong","Thanks very much. Jon, with organic sales now having to accelerate a bit more, can you talk through some of the incremental big initiatives that need to be taken to drive improvements because it seems a bit too simple to say that getting out of some of the slower growing categories and the portfolio shift is going to be enough. I mean is there a function of consumers across a number of categories not just within HVC [ph], but across Staples sort of trading out of bigger brands and so potentially more niche you\u2019re offering here and there?","Jon Moeller","Thanks Olivia. Our largest brands are our fastest growing brands. That\u2019s true over a five year period, over a three year period, over a one year period and was true last quarter. So I\u2019m not disputing the dynamic that you describe in terms of smaller brands impact in some categories. I think it\u2019s more probably, for example in some of the beverage categories and two categories. But any period of time we look at, convinces us that along with the intuitive benefits in big brand platforms in terms of innovation, importance to retailers et cetera, convinces us that this is a business model that will continue to work for us.","In terms of, you mentioned organic sales acceleration I just want to put that in context a little bit. I really don\u2019t see significant deceleration. Let me explain that. We rounded up to two2 for the last two quarters. This quarter we rounded down to one. We\u2019re talking in very small differences quarter-to-quarter sequentially. I mentioned in my prepared remarks the impact that the time the expansion tax increase had in Japan. That item alone if you take that out of the results we would have rounded to two. My point is not that, that\u2019s a measure of victory or defeat. My point is simply that I don\u2019t see any systemic deceleration in the sales quarter-to-quarter.","Portfolio as you rightly indicate will help from both the top-line and a bottom-line stand point. And you are absolutely right there is additional work on brands and in some markets we need to do to maximize growth and I mentioned those in my prepared remarks as well. We have work to do in Mexico though we\u2019re getting through that very nicely. We have work to do in China and as I mentioned China growth rates continue to be good, so that all looks pretty reasonable. And as you know from our results we have continued work to do on beauty some of which will be addressed through the portfolio and some of which we\u2019re currently making significant progress on.","I think when you step back and I realize it\u2019s a little bit difficult to see and I certainly appreciate that, but we\u2019re really on track or ahead of everything we\u2019re trying to do to transform this company to a more sustainable, more reliable grower on both the top and bottom line and that gets lost in the messiness of execution if you will and frankly through the flog of FX currently. We\u2019re very happy with where we sit in terms of the progress we\u2019re making on both the portfolio and on the brands that are going to constitute the new company.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll take a question from Chris Ferrara from Wells Fargo.","Chris Ferrara","Hey, thanks. Jon, I guess I apologize in advance for kind of a long question, but inventory reductions and unprofitable promos right that you guys have been backing out I guess. I want to talk a little bit about. So can you revisit specifically the drivers of the weakness in Mexico because I know you\u2019re talking about consumption tax? I think there was some exiting of some unprofitable promotion. I think you\u2019re also citing some inventory reductions. So can you at least give more specifics, I guess around, how those issues are may be related and then for Mexico and for China, how long do these inventory corrections take? I know in China Unilever should have ripped the Band-Aid off and took a 20% hit. Do you have a defined strategy on this and how long will it drag and then just lastly are there any other markets where this stuff is happening may be just even on a smaller scale. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thank Chris. Let me deal with Mexico first. In any of the developing markets, the supply chains from the manufacturer\u2019s door to a store are long and layered. China is an example; you\u2019re going through distributors wholesalers secondary wholesalers. And so when there is a significant change in market growth rate as there was in Mexico as a result of the consumption tax increase last year, as there have been in china as many of our competitors have reported, there is a lot of inventory in that system which needs to get drawn down. And you\u2019re not in complete control of how quickly that can be accomplished because you\u2019re not owning all of that inventory. But we\u2019re working our way through that. In Mexico, if you look at growth rates quarter-to-quarter it improved significantly on the order of magnitude of 10 points and we\u2019re expecting significant further improvement in AMJ. So I would say that one we are largely at least from a visibility horizon we see our way through that.","China as I mentioned there is - if you look at consumption we\u2019re in a very good place in China in many categories. We are probably two quarters in through the inventory reduction that needs to occur that\u2019s largely consistent with what our competitors have reported as well. I would say we\u2019ve got another quarter or two to go there and then we have some structural work that we need to do. But as I said these are large developing markets with very complicated long layered supply chains and these are dynamics that are affecting the industry broadly, but once we\u2019re through them, it\u2019s back to business as normal and we compete on the basis of the strength of our products and brands and we feel very good about that.","I would tell you Chris, that there are no other large issues like this that I\u2019m currently aware of. We will have to and we talked about this several times have to manage very carefully in some of the markets where our currency devaluation has been significant because those market sizes can change pretty significantly and we\u2019ll do that.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll go to Wendy Nicholson of Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi, a couple of things. First of all just a follow up on China, I was listening to what you said and I guess I don\u2019t understand some of the other companies like Unilever and Colgate talked about destocking in China as of last summer if not earlier and now it\u2019s kind of only heading [indiscernible]. I\u2019m just curious, why does it seem that the timing is kind of unique to one manufacturer at a time that\u2019s just a follow up. But then the bigger question is from a volume growth perspective and kind of how it pertains to your kind of longer term growth algorithm. It just strikes me that we\u2019ve seen an enormous number of really big, may be not enormous, but order magnitude really big successful innovations from you over the last four quarters and yet we still haven\u2019t seen much volume growth. And so I know we\u2019re going to get into easier comps, but I sort of - it doesn\u2019t sound to me like the innovations are coming down the pike are as big as FlexBall or as big as Pods or Flings or what not. And so is there a change in your long-term outlook for how much of volume growth is going to contribute to the top line and plus when I promised just on the marketing budget I understand the idea of doing more with less, but given how competitive the market is and given how lower your volume growth is why wouldn\u2019t you choose to take some of those productivity savings and jut do more with more? Thanks","Jon Moeller","Alright. First in terms of timing, different companies frankly have very different product mixes and they move through different distribution channels. So if you think about Unilever as a large food business in China it is very possible that they could have a different dynamic than the other channels and we\u2019re talking displacement of one quarter here or something like that. So that\u2019s that item. In terms of volume and initiatives, the biggest impact on volume has been the pricing before FX and that will continue until those markets recover or until that annualizes.","But our innovations, if you look at the big ones that you mentioned, first they\u2019re contributing to both category growth and share growth. And category growth is a real indication of the strength of an innovation. Does it lift the entire category? And we\u2019ve seen that behind the things that I mentioned earlier and the good news is that those largely have been fully expanded in one market, the U.S. And we expand those globally we expect to see that same impact just like we did with all Always Discreet in both the UK and the U.S. for example. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic as we look forward about the strength of our innovation program and what that can do from the top line. We\u2019re going to have to continue to manage the volume impacts of FX, but we\u2019re really focused on the revenue number as the leverage to generate operating profit and cash and we\u2019re doing reasonably well there.","On marketing, as I mentioned we are doing exactly what you would suggest we do Wendy, which is invest more where it makes sense to do that. And these innovations that I\u2019ve talked about are exactly one place where we\u2019re doing is just that and we\u2019ll continue to do that. I mean the investment behind the introduction of new brand in terms of Always Discreet you could imagine is significant and we\u2019re very happy with that because of the returns that we can generate and because of the impact that\u2019s had on those markets which are as I mentioned have doubled the growth rate versus the pre-entry period. So we\u2019re not talking here about construction on marketing dollars; what we are talking about is, being as efficient and effective as we can and spending those dollars where they drive returns.","Operator","And we have a question from Steve Powers of UBS.","Steve Powers","Hi, Jon. I just wanted to dig in to your comments on strategy a bit more. As you step back as you mentioned productivity efforts have been sizeable for a number of years and they seem to be running ahead of plan. You\u2019ve made significant shifts in how you\u2019re organizing now, how your portfolio is structured, but alongside that growth has been a struggle. And I think we\u2019d all acknowledge that the macro environment hasn\u2019t helped, but do you think there is a risk that all this inwardly focused change in operational improvement has actually impeded your efforts to execute on a larger strategy that you articulated namely uncovering consumer insights and driving consumer preferred innovations because it just seems like all these internal improvements are continually being offset by relative struggles in that external marketplace. I don\u2019t mean for this to be an unfair question, but I\u2019m just wondering what point its worth asking whether organic growth challenges may actually be exacerbated by all this internal change and whether improvement may have to, to some extent just wait until those internal projects run their course? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Steve. That\u2019s actually a very good and very fair question and it\u2019s something that where we continue to be in active dialogue on here at P&G. We\u2019ve been very deliberate about the pace of some of the changes and ensuring that we have the capacity to execute, to serve consumers, to serve shoppers and do that in a more effective manner every day. So that\u2019s exactly the question that we ask ourselves. It\u2019s why, for example we said, we\u2019re going to take two years to complete the portfolio program as opposed to overnight. That we have the capacity to do that and deliver the business and so again I think you\u2019re asking the right question. It\u2019s one that we ask ourselves and we will make choices that maximize the total. That\u2019s one of the beauties of the metric that we\u2019re working against in terms operating TSR, it\u2019s an integrated metric, which strives choice and balance across both growth and value creation. You simply can\u2019t get there without one leg of that stool and the third leg being cash creation. So we\u2019re approaching this in a very holistic sense, very cognizant of the right question that you asked and are trying to get the balance right.","As I indicated earlier we feel very good about where we are in terms of the progression against those strategic initiatives that you outlined and others including and the redesign of the supply chain. And most of our big brands and categories were growing fairly well. As I mentioned, if you look at grooming health care, baby care, family care and family care we grew at 9%, 6% and 2% respectively. So that\u2019s not an indication of any systemic pinch point if you will, where we haven\u2019t performed as well, as well it\u2019s more a function of an individual business dynamic.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll move to Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Thanks, good morning. I thought a follow up I guess on that would - the idea of taking three years for the divestiture process. I mean to what degree was that creating or is it any disruption on - employees wonder I know about what things sold and when or retailers or competitors are kind of looking at the things that we can pounce on a business where we think that P&G deemphasizing. So what [indiscernible] did you think that may be actually weighing on organic [indiscernible]. The other thing was that Jon, in talking about how you feel good internally about the progress being made, is it, but a thin map, but messing of the execution. Maybe doesn\u2019t look a great word to it, but I feel like the one thing that P&G committed to three years ago was - nearly three years ago was, we will improve the execution. And that doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s like happening, so whether it\u2019s an one off thing to pop up with China and Mexico there and honestly I\u2019m not convinced there won\u2019t be another big one off two or three quarters from now. So what is it that has or hasn\u2019t changed that on cote-on-cote execution in the market? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Let me tackle the last one first. It was a poor word choice. I should have said, the chunkiness of execution. Frankly, we\u2019ve been very intentional in the focus on improving execution. I feel very good about the progress that we\u2019re making there. So I apologize for that word choice. But there are just big chunks moving in and out as we make these very big transformational moves, which can flatter things up a little bit.","In terms of organic sales growth and the portfolio impact, if you look at the businesses, take Duracell as an example, which is we\u2019re currently working to transition to butcher a half away. But the entire period of the business was working on that project, leading up to the signing of the deal and post the signing of the deal, managing through transition. That business has held up extremely well, building market share. I won\u2019t go into the details, but several of the other businesses that we\u2019re looking to sell are also performing very well. In other words, growth rates were above the 100 index versus year ago. So I think we\u2019ve got about the right balance in terms of the pace at which we\u2019re moving and the work to be done. As I said, it\u2019s something that we relook every day, but it\u2019s not major concern at this point.","Operator","And now we have a question from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Market.","Nik Modi","Yeah, good morning guys. So just few quick ones from me. Jon, some in the media world would suggest that P&G has taken its marketing mix too digital heavy, so I just wondered if you could respond to that and your perspective around that. And then the second question is, in your prepared remarks you indicated [indiscernible] rationalization will take place in the core portfolio over the next couple of years, if I heard that I right. Just curious how we should think about that and its impact on organic revenue growth as we look out the next couple of years, I mean I know you\u2019re not giving guidance, but just how should we kind of think about it from a magnitude standpoint?","Jon Moeller","These are skews are at the long far tail in terms of productivity. So we have businesses that are less than 1% of the sales and the same is true with profit. So I think if anything by removing the clutter by allowing us to focus on product lines and skews that really matter to consumers and customers that should have a positive impact on the top-line, not a negative. These are itches in some cases, but they\u2019re meaningful in terms of the amount of complexities that they create. That\u2019s true in our operations, that\u2019s true at the shelf, that\u2019s true in the warehouse.","In terms of our approach to digital versus prudential media, we viewed this very much as an and, not an or, they complement each other. So we look at it very holistically. We\u2019ve guided in our choice by two things, one is where consumers are spending their time in terms of consumption of media. We need to be reasonably in step with that and the second is, depending on the category, what media they want to interact with and learn about our products on. And that\u2019s different across categories. So we\u2019re going to be guided, as in everything we do by the consumer and if we stay with that approach we\u2019ll probably not stray too far from what\u2019s right.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move to Javier Escalante of Consumer Edge Research.","Javier Escalante","Good morning, everyone. Jon, I have to say that I\u2019m still having a hard reconciling the top-line growth of 1%, with your positive remarks about some of your big brands Pampers. The flip side of the response that you gave to Olivia earlier is that you\u2019re basically are telling the investors that Proctor performance in the past quarters had been actually weaker and organic sales only around up to two. Shouldn\u2019t you be considering a bigger portfolio change or a breakup even, given that sectors like beauty are not only getting more fragmented and smaller than any food and beverages categories that you alluded earlier and instead of reducing SKU\u2019s by 15% and 20% as Nik just said, what you\u2019re going to have is split up [ph] top-line growth for the next two years. Thank you","Jon Moeller","We\u2019re going to try to have fullest ability on the portfolio moves by the summer and I think we\u2019ll be in a position then to articulate why we think these are the right moves and so I\u2019m going to save that conversation for that point in time. But we\u2019re being federal [ph] in our approach across each of the categories and brands. There\u2019s no business that we haven\u2019t objectively analyzed and so I think we\u2019re going to end up in a pretty good place in that regard.","In terms of - look on this whole thing of small brands and fragmentation. One, our data doesn\u2019t support that being an issue from most of the businesses that we\u2019re going to maintain. Second, where differentiated performance matters and where differentiated performance is delivered, this dynamic does not remain. So for example, and I\u2019ll bring it to beauty in a second Javier, but if you think about Pampers as an example, I can\u2019t think of a new mother who would be asking herself, where performance really matters, would be asking herself, what\u2019s the new diaper that nobody\u2019s ever tried before or where I can discover the next diaper? That\u2019s not the thought process. There\u2019s a job that needs to be done, there\u2019s a brand that has proven over decades, it can do the job, it can do it better than the other offerings that are out there and it\u2019s offered at a price that creates a good value.","If you think about performance and where performance matters in a beauty context, think about anti dandruff shampoos. I\u2019ve got a problem, I need a solution. This is not time to experiment, this is time to solve. Head & Shoulders has been solving dandruff issues for decades. It\u2019s a brand that consumers know and trust and it\u2019s offered at a reasonable value. So I think we have to think about the specific dynamics of a category, the consumer approach to the category, the relevance of innovation of the category and differential performance as a driver of purchase before we make broad conclusions about whether fragmentation is going to occur or not.","In terms of your question on split up, again let\u2019s wait until we have the portfolio in front of us and talk about it at that point. We\u2019re very bullish and again this is not just based on what we think is going to happen. This is based on 10, 5, 3 and 1 years of data which is very consistent and its outcome. And these are categories that we have long track records of winning in, where we\u2019re typically the market leader with brands and other prototypes in those category.","Operator","And next we have Joe Altobello with Raymond James.","Q - Joe Altobello","Hi, this is Christine on for Joe. I just wanted to change the topic quickly and go to commodity costs and whether you\u2019re still expecting that to be a $500 million to $700 million tail end next year. And how much of that do you actually expect to recover out of pricing. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","Our current estimate would be more than the order magnitude to $600 million to $800 million of BT commodity cost savings next fiscal year. Really don\u2019t have a point of view yet on how much of that we\u2019ll be able to take to the bottom-line as opposed to past proven price. So if you just reflect on the dynamics in the industry, this is an industry that, with the exception of some international competitors who have FX tailwinds is challenged from a profit growth stand point and that\u2019s a dynamic that generally supports or using this saving as a way to help that situation. So we\u2019re hopeful that many of these will come to the bottom line, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll have to see as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question will come from Ali Dibadj of Bernstein","Ali Dibadj","Hi guys. Jon, I mean you\u2019re getting the same question from many folks over and over again and I\u2019m not sure the message is necessarily clear which is, we\u2019ve been hearing a lot of promise that help us round the corner for years, years and every back half of the year you kind of limp across the finish line. If not just this year and I guess, for me at least I just wonder whether P&G has the right to be consistently in a short-term optimist at least given its recent track record. And now the promise is wait till we break up 14% of sales, 6% operating profit out of our business, things will be much better, but at that point how much longer would we have to wait for you guys to decide that maybe something even bigger has to happen, maybe you really got to rebase your guidance and you shouldn\u2019t be delivering double digit EPS growth, maybe you really have to break up the company even further? I think there\u2019s a lot of frustration in terms of trying to see the logs grant to the macro stuff, grant to the FX, but others have that too. How much longer do we wait I guess is really the core question and especially after this next promise divestitures, how much longer do we have to wait after that? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","The last year you mentioned FX, I think you\u2019re right to mention that excluding FX we grew 14% on the bottom-line, this year will grow double digits. I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the operating improvements that we are making, productivity and otherwise are coming through. And if it weren\u2019t for FX, we would be having a very different discussion right now. We do have brands and businesses where we need to continue to strengthen the top-line, we\u2019re cognizant of that, I mentioned that and that kind of is what it is. We look at the change that we\u2019re in the middle of executing. It\u2019s probably the biggest transformation this company has gone through across the totality of portfolio, supply chain, organization, structure and design and as I said, it\u2019s hard to see that all come together at this point, but each of the pieces, we\u2019re very happy with the progress and we\u2019ll see.","Operator","Your final question will comes from the desk of Caroline Levy of CLSA.","Caroline Levy","Good morning, thanks so much. Just a question about beauty again, Olay and Pantene are different from Head & Shoulders because there\u2019s not this clear need and promise and delivery. So if you just look at Olay and the performance. I know China has been very problematic, but around the world, why do you think P&G really should be in that passive business?","Jon Moeller","Well, First of all Caroline, younger looking skin I think is a real need. It\u2019s increasingly a need of mine. If you count [ph] my hair care need and I\u2019m not going to comment on specific businesses that we are going to be in or out. Again we\u2019ll do that when we\u2019re ready to do that, but that\u2019s a business where function and performance, differentiated performance does matter. It\u2019s what enabled us to build one of the largest, the largest facial skin care brand in the world and continues to have incredibly strong equity and frankly is growing significantly in many parts of the world where we haven\u2019t cluttered the equity in the shelves as badly as we for instance in the U.S. and China.","I was just a couple of weeks ago in the Gulf, in the Middle East and that\u2019s a market where the brand architecture is much cleaner and clear and that business is growing double digits. Something is true in the UK and Olay, we\u2019re again - we haven\u2019t cluttered either the messaging the equity or the shelf. So skin care is clearly - and SK II as an example, that delivers a clear benefit that\u2019s coveted by women particularly in Asia. So it\u2019 not a business that is all about fashions and style, it\u2019s a business that\u2019s about performance.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"17518":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Barclays Back-to-School Consumer Conference September  8, 2016  8:15 AM ET","Executives","Jon Moeller - CFO","Analysts","Lauren Rae Lieberman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Operator","P&G would like to remind you that today's presentation includes a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the presentation, the Company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. For completeness, Procter & Gamble has posted on its website www.pg.com, a copy of the key slides from this presentation and a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.","Lauren Rae Lieberman","So with one word to mark [ph] to start the P&G\u2019s transformation as the CAGNY 2012 cost savings program announcement. We\u2019ll be four and a half years since the turnaround, if sales and earnings trends have only slowed since then. So within this context, we think the biggest question remains how and when P&G can transition to a time a period of sustained, organic sales growth inline or better than its peers. While it\u2019s positive in our mind that nearly $1 billion step up in advertising this year should reach well beyond advertising we\u2019ve [ph] been spending this year. We do think seeing a return on these investments will take time.","Here to discuss some of the changes underway and efforts to accelerate growth, we are fortunate to have CFO, Jon Moeller with us again this year at the conference.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Lauren and good morning everybody. I\u2019m going to just briefly cover recent results and our outlook for 2017. I\u2019ll talk about our efforts to re-accelerate top line growth. I\u2019ll update you on productivity and portfolio progress and discuss how we are strengthening our organisation and culture to sustainably win.","Fiscal 2016 organic sales growth for the company improved sequentially through the year. Organic sales for the June quarter were up 2%. This includes about a one point drag from the combination of the cleanup work we are doing with the ongoing portfolio and the impact of Venezuela. Excluding these two impacts of 2% would be 3%, progress but with more work to do.","Fourth quarter growth was volume driven. Organic volume grew 2% with progress in every segment. Organic sales also grew in every segment. Market value share trends improved in every segment for the six month period versus the 12-month period and the same is true in the three month period versus the six month period.","Back up sales momentum was in line with the front half or ahead in nine of ten categories, again progress with more work to do.","Turning to the bottom line, constant currency core earnings per share were up 7% last fiscal year. Including foreign exchange, core earnings per share were down 2%. Core gross margin and operating margin improved by triple digit indices including and excluding currency.","We generated $12.1 billion in free cash flow with 115% free cash flow productivity. We paid $7.4 billion in dividends and reduced outstanding shares at a value of over $8 billion through a combination of share repurchase and the Duracell share exchange.","In total, nearly $16 billion in dividend payments share exchange and share repurchase. This year, we are out looking further progress on the top and bottom lines. We don\u2019t expect straight line improvements, some quarters will be better than others, but we should continue over the course of the fiscal year to make progress. We expect another strong year of cash productivity and over $22 billion return to share owners through dividends, share exchange and share repurchase. We continue to outlook up to $70 billion in dividends, share repurchase and share exchange over the four year period through fiscal 2019.","As David indicated in his remarks with our earnings release, we are focused on balanced growth. Top line, bottom line and cash flow, and the reasons are simple. We would need to grow a margin 200 basis points year-in and year-out to deliver top third total share holder return without sales growth that is simply not sustainable.","We would need to grow our top line high single digits year-in and year-out to deliver top third total share holder return in the absence of margin growth. No Company in our industry has ever done this; it\u2019s unlikely that we will.","If we deliver balanced top line growth and margin expansion but don\u2019t turn it into cash as you know we also don\u2019t get home. It\u2019s very simple; we need to grow the top line, build margins and be efficient and turnings [ph] into cash to sustainably deliver top third total share holder return.","We need to accelerate top line growth reaching and sustaining organic sales growth at\/or slightly ahead of underlying market growth. Productivity improvement and cost savings are a necessity providing fuel for top line growth and margin expansion. We are also strengthening our product portfolio and our organization and culture to win more consistently.","These four focus areas are mutually reinforcing, they enable and build upon each other. They each contribute to stronger top line, bottom line and cash flow growth. Top line growth starts and ends with consumer and shopper delight. Winning at the zero, first and second moments of truth. When consumers research our categories and brands, purchase them in a store or online and use them in their homes.","Winning these critical moments of truth requires consumer and shopper insights that inspire products and package innovations. It requires robust value equations and consumer communication with compelling campaigns that lead to competitive advantages for P&G\u2019s brands and products.","We are investing in innovation that delights consumers and builds categories. Superior, better performing consumer preferred products and packages offered at a good value that result in a delightful consumer experience which drives trial, repeat purchase and loyalty.","P&G continues to be the innovation leader in our categories and this year\u2019s IRI Innovation Pacesetter report P&G had four of the top ten innovations and 8 of the top 25. I\u2019ll highlight recent innovations in three of our ten categories to give you an idea of the types of things we are working on in each.","We continue to be the innovation leader in fabric care. We are growing our fabric care business with consumer preferred brands and product offerings like our premium performance and premium priced unit dose detergents. And our market leading and market expanding scent bead fabric enhancers.","Our unit dosed detergents now generate over $1.5 billion in annual sales behind the 3-in-1 technology of a combined detergent stain remover and brightener. In the U.S. unit dose products account for 15% of category sales with P&G holding a 78% share of the form.","Premium products like PODs are driving market growth with the U.S. detergent category up four points last fiscal year. The same is true for fabric enhancers. Spurred by the rapid growth of scent beads, the U.S. fabric enhancer category is growing, up 7 points on a value basis last year, with the scent bead form where P&G holds a 72% share of growing in the mid-20s.","Cascade Platinum Action Pacs cleans stuck-on food in just one wash with no pre wash needed with three times more film-fighting power than the leading competitive gel. Last year in North America, we increased sampling our Cascade Platinum by 20% to increase awareness and trial. Sales grew high single digits.","In Feminine Care, innovations such as All-was-Radiant and All-was-discreet have been the key drivers to improve top line growth. Radiant is our best performing and most highly rated feminine pads. It absorbs ten times its weight with a unique, proprietary absorber material and provides up to a 100% leak free protection, driving nearly a point of market share growth for all -- was in the U.S. last year","Discreet is launched in eight markets and is driving strong category growth post launch. Discreet technology provides protection while offering incredible discretion. Our pads absorb two times more than needed with a leak free guarantee.","We are also investing in packaging which is a key component of winning each of the consumer moments of truth. A winning package attracts, is distinctive, familiar and appealing. It answers the four key messages of strong packaging. Who am I? What am I? Why am I good for you? And how do I work for you?","Our new Ariel packaging upgrade enables consumers to those [ph] to delight with a transparent cap. The cap shape is designed for easy dosing as well as a clean drained back into the bottle which eliminates waste and mess. Let\u2019s watch a quick video that demonstrates the use of dosing with a no-waste drain back top.","[Video Presentation]","This fiscal year [Indiscernible] is launching new consumer preferred packaging with hard [ph] work that improves shelf communication, using nomenclature that drives a clear and simple product understanding. This package grows stronger across all consumer measures and the new marketing campaign drives what is important to consumers cleaning the air versus simply scenting the air with our proprietary odour clear technology.","In May, 2016, Tide launch the new ad campaign urging parents to keep Tide Pods up, closed and safe with the package design featuring a new Child-Guard zipper available on Gain Flings, also available on Gain Flings packages.","We're investing an increased media reach, consistency and effectiveness. In the fourth quarter of last year we increased our media investment versus the prior year by over $200 million. We plan to continue that in fiscal 2017 consistently delivering four quarters of strong brand support.","We have many compelling ad campaigns in market now from our latest Always, Like a Girl Spot, to Charmin, Pause Button, to SK-II Change Destiny. Let's watch our latest, Always, # Like a Girl execution called key plane # Like a Girl.","[Video Presentation]","We started our first Always, #Like a Girl film in 2014, shifting perceptions around the term Like a Girl from negative to positive. Key plane has #Like a Girl results are very strong, more than a 100 million views, the largest reaching Always, #Like a Girl video to-date.","The campaign delivered 1.5 billion impressions and was named the number one of the Rio 2016 Olympic game by campaign magazine. On a wider side, here's the great ad from Charmin.","[Video Presentation]","In addition to be an official sponsor of the Rio 2016 Olympic Game, Charmin became the unofficial sponsor of the Pause Button, to ensure not a second of the Olympic game were missed.","This spot was so well received. We added online support and integrated this into the Charmin-based TV plan during the two weeks surrounding the games, which drove meaningful increases in both reach and frequency.","Next is our latest spot from SK-II Change Destiny campaign which is centered on the idea that women can change destiny of their skin and their lives. I apologize in advance as this is a little bit longer digital execution.","[Video Presentation]","The Change Destiny campaign has delivered over 8 billion impressions in the past year with over 117 million views to date. More importantly, this campaign contributed to a strong fiscal 2016 by growing new SKU two [ph] users by 20% and delivering sales growth in the low teens.","We are also investing in sampling with a special focus at the point of market entry. We are increasing sampling in new washing machines, a key point of category entry and category change.","In fiscal 2015 we distributed 5 million samples of washing machines globally. Last fiscal year we distributed 17 million samples. This fiscal year we\u2019ll distribute 30 million samples of our best performing products.","We put Fusion ProGlide FlexBall razors in the hands of nearly 80% of young men. Over 2 million samples last year with our 18th birthday sampling program. In Baby Care 70% of new models in the U.S. will receive samples of our best products through our prenatal and hospital programs. And as I mentioned earlier in North America we increased sampling on Cascade Platinum by 20% last year.","We are increasing sales coverage in the fastest growing channels. The e-commerce channel is the fastest growing well above the average 3% of our total market. Our e-commerce sales were up significantly last year with six out of eight top countries holding or growing e-commerce share. This is an opportunity we will continue to invest in.","We continue to consistently improve cost and cash productivity with significant upside still ahead. We have accelerated and exceeded each of our productivity objectives and have now raised them. Our original five year cost of goods savings target was $6 billion. We delivered $7.2 billion, more than a $1 billion above the initial target.","We delivered cost of goods savings which were at or above target each over the last five fiscal years. We\u2019ve reduced manufacturing enrolment by 22% over the last four years. This includes new staffing necessary to support new capacity. On a same side basis, manufacturing enrolment is down about 27% through June of 2016 with additional progress planned in fiscal 2017. These figures exclude divestiture impacts.","Including divestitures will reduce manufacturing enrolment by about 30% by the end of fiscal 2017 which will be about 35% on a same side basis. In February we announced we will reduce non-manufacturing or overhead enrolment by 10% over five years. As of July 1st, we\u2019ve reduced enrolments by nearly 25%, 2.5 times the original target. These figures also exclude the impact of divestitures.","Including divestitures will reduce non-manufacturing enrolments by about 35% by the end of fiscal 2017. We\u2019re reducing non-working marketing expenditures, costs that don\u2019t impact reach frequency or continuity of our advertising in the trial generation programs. We were spending $2 billion per year on agency and production costs. Two years ago we reduced the roughly 6000 agencies we work with by nearly 40% and cut agency and production spending by about $370 million.","In fiscal 2016, we delivered another 250 million of agency related savings. We invest in these savings and advertising and sampling of consumer preferred products, over $600 million of savings in two years. We are driving productivity improvement up and down the income statement and across the balance sheet. Inventory days are down significantly. Payables days are up significantly enabled by our supply chain financing program.","Net of reinvestments in innovation, sales coverage, media, and sampling, productivity has enabled us to deliver constant currency gross and operating profit margin improvement and high single to double-digit constant currency earnings per share growth in each of the last four fiscal years. We improved gross and operating margins by triple-digit indices, both including and excluding currency in fiscal 2016.","We said over four years ago we needed to make cost and cash productivity part of our culture, as integral to our culture as innovation. We've made significant progress, and we have significant opportunity. Our strong track record and our line of sight to additional opportunity inform our intent to save as much as another $10 billion in costs over the next five years. The majority of these savings will come from cost of goods, an area where we have consistently met or exceeded our productivity objectives.","Three cost areas make up cost of goods, manufacturing expense, transportation and warehousing and materials, each offer savings. Supply chain transformation is in its early stages, first in North America, next in Europe, then in Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa. We're in investment mode now with savings to ramp-up in 2, 3, and 4 years.","Our new U.S. mixing centers are up and running, putting roughly 80% of volume within 24 hours of the shelves. U.S. on-shelf availability has improved as a result by more than a point to roughly 96%.","We're constructing multi-category manufacturing sites in geographically strategic locations like West Virginia to replace smaller, single category sites in less cost effective locations. We are well underway with the construction of this new site that's scheduled to start production in calendar year 2017.","As we make these moves, we're upgrading and standardizing manufacturing platforms to lower cost and facilitate faster innovation. These new sites offer opportunity to apply technology to automate more of our operations delivering additional manufacturing efficiencies.","Over the last 18 months we have installed more than 80 collaborative robots and we are aggressively expanding their application. These robots have a variety of uses including picking cases and wrapping pallets. We are testing other technologies like automated forklifts to reduce cost and improve safety. We are digitizing our manufacturing and warehousing systems. We are utilizing new warehouse software that reduces idle time and travel distance of finished product as it moves through our mixing centers, improving productivity by upto 35%.","We are delivering reductions in cost of goods sold through packaging and formulation transformations using iMFLUX, a proprietary injection molding innovation. iMFLUX enhances existing injection molds and presses and builds new molds that increase throughput upto a 100% results in an improved speed to market, fewer presses and molds and significantly lower cost. This technology is exclusive to P&G and select partners and non-P&G market segments and is protected by 45 branded and 200 pending patents globally.","After two strong years of savings we\u2019ll enter next year still spending $1.4 billion on agency related cost. There is still more room to improve here. As we fully operationalize the new focused 10 category company, there will be additional opportunities to increase organization efficiency, agility, and speed of decision making.","Finally, we are working to improve the effectiveness of our promotional spending. We see clear opportunities to improve the effectiveness of this spend for us and our retail partners using new tools and data to build the value of our categories and the share of P&G brands.","So again we're targeting up to $10 billion of additional savings over the next five years. We expect to reinvest a significant amount of the savings in R&D, and product and packaging improvements, in sales coverage, and in brand awareness and trial building programs to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth.","Moving quickly to portfolio. Over the last 18 months we've divested, discontinued, or consolidated 63 brands, including the completion of the Duracell transaction at the end of February. We have 42 more brands in the exit process, including 41 brands in the deal with Coty. We're currently winding down transition support for Duracell. We've completed the systems work in standing up the Beauty business for the transaction with Coty.","By the end of the fiscal year we\u2019ll have exited 105 brands and all the complexity they create. These brands represent only about 6% of base period profit. We currently remain on track to close the deal with Coty in October 2016. A press release was published on September 1st regarding this transaction; the tender of our process is currently estimated to remain open through midnight on September 29th.","Going forward, our portfolio will be anchored on 10 category-based business units and 65 brands. These are categories where P&G has leading market positions and where product technologies deliver performance differences that matter to consumers. These 10 businesses have historically grown faster with higher margins than the balance of the company.","We're focusing on businesses where product and performance drive purchase decisions, where there are clear consumer jobs to be done and clear objective measures of performance. These are products that consumers purchase and use on a daily basis. And they're in structurally attractive categories.","Within these core businesses we're focusing our offerings, making smart choices for short, mid and long-term value creation, foregoing bad businesses, even when these choices create near-term top-line pressure.","In our Mexico Family Care we made a choice to discontinue low-tier, unprofitable and commoditizing products, and they [ph] were very profitable high-tier differentiated products, moving from double-digit negative margins to double-digit positive margins.","The top line head line associated with this should be fully annualized by the end of the calendar year.","In India, we've made a similar choice to de-prioritize several unprofitable lines of business, which negatively impact short-term top line growth rates but will lead longer-term to a much more profitable business that will grow strongly.","We're taking a similar approach in our Fabric Care product portfolio, discontinuing product forms, additives, bars, bleaches, and tablets and value tier and powder detergents that have been a drag on profitability and value creation. These choices are causing a top line drag on the global Fabric Care business, but improve the profitability and the long-term attractiveness of the business.","The combined portfolio choices have been causing about a one point drag on organic sales growth. We expect this headwind to continue for the balance of the calendar year and anticipate in the second half of the fiscal as we began annualizing these effects.","As we come out of this, we\u2019ll have strong top line growth that has really worked something. There is really no point to growth if it isn\u2019t worth something. Over the past few fiscal years we\u2019ve reduced SKUs by about 18% on the ongoing ten category portfolio. This has also impacted our top line negatively in the near term, longer term it will yield top and bottom line benefits through clear assortment, enhance shopability, fewer outer stocks and lower costs.","As we work to accelerate top line growth, enabled by productivity and the portfolio, we are transforming our organization and culture. We're making many changes that by themselves may seem small and obvious, but together they are significant and important.","As an example, we've made several important changes in how we go to market. We've eliminated overlapping resources and duplicative structures and responsibilities of marketing and sales professionals in the global business units and the market development organizations, clarifying responsibilities and strengthening accountability.","Reflecting this, we changed the name of the market development organizations to Selling and Market Operations, small but very important.","We\u2019ve moved more resources into regional and local markets, learning from innovating for and serving local consumers. Only 10% of our commercial function employees including management brands, sales and finance set in global roles. Global categories drive scale of manufacturing platforms; they own hard points on global equities and set global pricing strategies.","The vast majority, 90% of our commercial function employees set [ph] in regional and local roles, focussed on managing the business in their country. Regional roles owned profit-and-loss statements launch innovation pipelines and set pricing and promotional strategy.","Local markets influence innovation with their market insights and execute the daily business with the necessary flexibility within an agreed framework to manage local dynamics on a real time basis. We are changing our talent development and assignment planning to drive more mastery and depth. The objective is simple. Improve business results by getting and keeping the right people in the right places to develop and apply deep category mastery to win.","Consistent with this, we're dedicating sales resources to categories or sectors. In our larger markets sales resources have greater accountability back to the categories they serve, which is also a change.","An example, of where we dedicated and added resources to improve category mastery is our North American Personal Healthcare sales force. Two years ago, the average tenure of salespeople within the category was less than 12 months. Only about half of the sales people were dedicated only to Personal Healthcare. And 100% of the people were either new hires coming to P&G with no work experience or were transfers from other P&G businesses.","Over the last year or so we've added resources to the Consumer Healthcare sales force. Almost half of those people have prior healthcare sales experience. Today, 100% of people selling the business are dedicated to Personal Healthcare. And the average experience level is now more than five years of healthcare sales experience inside or outside of P&G.","We're aligning incentives at lower and more specific level of granularity to better match these responsibilities and then to increase accountability.","Two changes will take place in fiscal 2017; annual bonus awards will be determined by their specific results of individual business teams at a region or country level versus global average results making their rewards much more closely to their work.","Second, our long term incentive program or our performance stock program will be expanded to include all people at the Vice President level raising participation from about 30 top executives to about 250. This program enables broader alignment across top leaders to a strategy of balanced top to bottom line growth as well as strong cash flow productivity, the drivers of total operating share holder return.","P&G is fortunate to consistently source and develop strong talent. But we intend to maintain and we intend to maintain or develop from within approach. But there are times when the best talent for a role will not be inside our organization. Going forward, we are going to look at outside hiring more often when we needed to field the best team possible.","Over the last two years we've added 115 people to the U.S. retail sales force through external hiring. And more than half of them have prior sales experience. Over the last two years we've increased category dedication of the U.S. sales force by 20%, with more than 90% of sales now covered by category dedicated resources.","We doubled the number of experienced external hires last fiscal versus the prior year, bringing in experienced talent in five different levels of management, including at the Vice President level. Experienced hires comprised about 5% of all management hiring in 2016.","Bottom line, we're committed to getting, keeping, and growing the right people in the right place to drive better business results. Again, each of these changes may seem small and rather obvious, but collectively they're big and important changes for our organization and culture.","Each area of this transformation top line acceleration, productivity, portfolio, and strengthening our organizational and culture requires change. We're making good progress in each of these areas. But we know our success will ultimately be graded on the sales, profit, cash, and value creation results we deliver, not on the activities that get us there. We are committed to do everything we can and to change what must be changed to deliver these results.","We expect this year to represent another step towards our goal of balanced growth and value creation. We are committed to continued productivity improvement and cost savings that provides a fuel for innovation and investments needed to accelerate and sustain faster top line growth. We\u2019ve created in our sustaining strong cash productivity momentum. We are nearing the completion of the major portfolio moves to simplify and strengthen the category portfolio. And we're making similar moves at the brand and product form level to improve the profitability and value creation capability of the categories that we'll retain.","We're strengthening the organization and culture by improving our approaches toward talent acquisition, career management, decision making, accountability, and incentives. Our standards are high. We aren\u2019t satisfied with just being a little bit better. We want to be the best. We're making progress. And we're determined to win. But we're also realistic about the time it will take for the improvements and investments we're making to fully play out in our results.","Just one more thing before we go to Q&A, I want to mention two upcoming events including our first quarter 2017 earnings call scheduled for October 25 and importantly the P&G Analyst meeting in Cincinnati that\u2019s been scheduled for November 17 and 18. You\u2019ll receive invitations for these events very soon.","And with that I\u2019d be happy to take any questions. Lauren.","Question-and-Answer Session","Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman","So Jon, I think you\u2019ve been consistent and clear you know that the piece of the puzzle that are coming together will take time to fully manifest themselves in result. And that\u2019s that I still couldn\u2019t help but notice in the 10-K and comment on the discussion of long term target for EPS growth is now mid to high single digit not high single digits, that was a long term statement, so I just wanted you to maybe roughly you know discuss why the change?","Jon Moeller","So our long term algorithm starts with the top line, which is market growth or a little bit ahead. And as everybody in this room knows, market growth particularly in the developing markets has been decelerated so that reference to mid single digit simply reflects that near term reality. That\u2019s not what we are shooting for, we are shooting for high single digits, but we feel we have a responsibility to be very clear as to what the world affords us and our investors so we made that small change to the long term representation. [Indiscernible]","Lauren Rae Lieberman","I\u2019m sure that someone in this room has a question, but I\u2019ll just go again. And maybe shorter term just an update on China, so I know we\u2019ve seen sequential improvements and moving towards stabilization but just thought process and timing on kind of getting closer to a rate of market growth where you stand [ph] on some of your bigger categories putting some of the key changes in place and as that sort of has developed.","Jon Moeller","So we are making significant changes both to address the change in channel structure in China which is significant to move away from bigger format, hyper super channels into speciality channels, small box and e-commerce. We are making changes in our product portfolio to be more relevant to premium consumers, where 50% of the market is now being transacted and which is growing at double digits as opposed to the rest of the category which \u2013 the market which is flat to declining. We are totally changing our trade spending program and how we work with our distributor partners and our retailers and as Lauren [ph] said all of us are going to take some time, probably the longest lead time on that in some categories which have long product development cycles is getting the appropriate premium innovation into the market place.","Our hope certainly as we exit this fiscal year that you\u2019ll see continued momentum. We\u2019ve gone from minus eight on a quarter basis, minus 8% on the top line, minus 8, minus 4 and zero. I don\u2019t think you should extrapolate that too far forward as a straight line but its representative of our progress and I would hope as we are sitting here next year you know we\u2019d be back to where you are talking. John [Indiscernible]","Unidentified Analyst","China, will that be a drag on results?","Jon Moeller","China will be depends on how you look at it. I mean China in the last four quarters has grown below the category of the company, so by definition it\u2019s been a drag. I don\u2019t see that stopping in the next couple of quarters for sure, so yes, it will continue to be a drag on results.","Unidentified Analyst","Great.","Jon Moeller","Let\u2019s call -- break out. Thank you very much everybody."],"17638":["The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Q1 2020 Earnings Conference Call October 22, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Jon Moeller - Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Lauren Lieberman - Barclays","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Steve Powers - Deutsche Bank","Ali Dibadj - Bernstein","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Mark Astrachan - Stifel","Wendy Nicholson - Citi","Steve Strycula - UBS","Olivia Tong - Bank of America","Kevin Grundy - Jefferies ","Andrea Teixeira - JPMorgan","Grant O'Brien - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Nik Modi - RBC","Caroline Levy - Macquarie","Robert Ottenstein - Evercore ISI","Jon Andersen - William Blair","Edward Lewis - Atlantic Equities","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's Quarter End Conference Call. P&G would like to remind you that today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.","Also as required by Regulation G, Procter & Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter & Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website www.pginvestor.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.","Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.","Jon Moeller","Good morning. I know you're very busy this morning, so I'm going to make this very brief, about 10 minutes, and then turn straight to your questions. It's another strong quarter topline, bottom-line, and cash driven by our portfolio superiority, productivity, constructive disruption, and organization strategies.","Organic sales up 7%, four points of volume growth, three points of price mix. Two-year stack growth strengthened into an average of 5.5%. Over the last five quarters, two-year average growth has accelerated 2.5%, 3%, 3%, 4%, now 5.5%. Growth continues to be broad-based.","Each global category grew organic sales. Personal Care up mid-teens, Personal Health Care grew double-digits, Fabric Care, Home Care, Feminine Care, Family Care, and Oral Care each grew high singles, Hair Care grew mid-singles.","Each geographic region grew organic sales 4% or more. Focus markets and enterprise markets each up high singles. Our two largest markets the U.S., up 6%; China, up 13%. Japan another large market was up double-digits due in part to the timing benefit of VAT changes that went into effect on October 1st. E-commerce sales grew over 30%. All channel consumption remained ahead of underlying markets driving aggregate market share growth.","Moving to the bottom-line, core earnings per share was $1.37, up 22% versus the prior year. Foreign exchange was a $50 million after-tax headwind about $0.02 per share. On a constant currency basis, core earnings per share was up 24%.","Very strong underlying earnings progress; core gross margin, up 190 basis points; core operating margin, up 260 basis points; continued strong cash flow with adjusted free cash flow productivity of 91%; $1.9 billion of dividends paid; $3 billion of P&G stock repurchased.","In summary, a very strong quarter, solid volume, sales, and market share trends across categories and geographies. Strong operating earnings, margins advancing, strong core earnings per share growth, and continued high levels of cash returned to shareowners.","We continue to face challenges from a very volatile macro and geopolitical landscape and from competitive response to our faster growth, but we're making progress behind integrated and mutually reinforcing strategies. We focused and strengthened our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, in categories where we occupy a number one or number two position which have historically grown faster than the balance of the company and are more profitable.","If you're in categories where performance drives brand choice, you better perform. We made a deliberate choice to invest in the superiority of our products and packages, retail execution, marketing, and value in all price tiers where we compete, strengthening the short- and long-term health and competitiveness of our brands. We are extending our margin of advantage and increasing the quality of execution.","Additional investment will be needed to sustain this progress. The need for this investment the need to offset macro cost headwinds and the need to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth including margin expansion underscore the continued importance of productivity; cost out cash in; driving cost savings and efficiency improvements in all facets of our business in our second five-year $10 billion productivity program; expecting strong free cash flow productivity from working capital and CapEx efficiency.","Superiority and productivity are critical, but insufficient to keep us ahead in a world with a rapidly changing retail environment, quickly evolving consumer needs, media transformation, revolutionary changes in technology. We must and are leading the constructive disruption of our industry across all areas of the value chain.","We're disrupting the way we innovate by accelerating the speed and quality of our learning through lean innovation. We're monetizing innovation across industries to accelerate investment in R&D and broaden societal impact. We are disrupting in retail execution. We're reinventing brand building from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand building fueled by data and technology. We continue to disrupt our supply chain with transformation across the globe.","Finally, we're making organization structure and culture changes to better position us to win. We're taking steps to simplify the organization focusing effort, clarifying responsibility, increasing accountability, and structuring compensation and incentive programs to better align with these objectives.","On July 1st, we officially moved to a new organization structure designed to de-matrix the company and provide even greater clarity on responsibilities and reporting lines to focus and strengthen leadership accountability. We're operating in six industry-based sector business units or SBUs. The SBUs have profit and loss responsibility for the largest markets what we call the focus markets which represent about 80% of sales and 90% of the company's profit. The SBUs CEOs are focused on winning and driving value creation opportunities in these important markets.","We continue to invest in enterprise markets which have very attractive market growth rates. Our organizational structure there is being optimized to accelerate growth top and bottom-line in the dynamic macro environments that those markets present. The benefit of this design is the creation of a more focused, agile, accountable organization, operating at a lower cost, focused on winning through superiority, fueled by productivity, moving at the speed of the market.","I hope it continues to be evident that we've been successfully disrupting P&G. The choices we've made to focus and strengthen our portfolio in daily-use categories where performance drives brand choice, to establish and extend superiority of our brands, to make productivity as integral to our culture as innovation, to lead constructive disruption across the value chain, and to improve organization focus, agility, and accountability are not independent strategies.","They reinforce and build on each other. They position us well within our industry to deal with near-term macro and competitive challenges. They are the foundation for stronger balanced growth and value creation over the short, mid, and long-term.","Moving now to guidance. We're raising our outlook on each key metric: organic sales growth, core earnings per share growth and free cash flow productivity. We're increasing our outlook for organic sales growth from a range of 3% to 4% to a range of 3% to 5%. The markets in which we compete are growing at a 3% to 3.5% pace, so the midpoint of the higher organic sales range implies continued market share growth.","On the bottom line, we're raising our core earnings per share growth guidance from a range of 4% to 9% to a range of 5% to 10%. This reflects very strong first quarter results and our expectation of solid margin expansion for the year. We're raising our outlook for free cash flow productivity from 90% to 95% for the fiscal year.","The year will continue along track record of significant cash generation and cash return to shareowners. We expect to pay over $7.5 billion in dividends and repurchase $6 billion to $8 billion of P&G shares in fiscal 2020. While our first quarter results enable us to raise fiscal year targets, please keep in mind that the comps get more difficult as we move through the year, both on the top line and the bottom line.","Quarter year-ago top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7% as we progress through last fiscal year; bottom line 3%, 5%, 6%, 17%. Japan VAT-related timing impacts benefited Q1 company sales results by 30 basis points to 40 basis points but will cause a headwind in Q2.","Pricing annualizes as we move through the year affecting both top and bottom line trends. We'll comp the earnings gains from the loss of land sale and the Oral Care brand divestitures in Q4. Competitors will likely respond to our outperformance, which underscores the need for continued investment and superiority. Brexit uncertainty and volatility in foreign exchange Argentina and Turkey for example will be impacting the balance of year results.","Our revised guidance is based on current market growth rates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant currency weakness, commodity cost increases or additional geopolitical disruptions are not anticipated within the new and improved guidance ranges.","With that, I'm happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.","Lauren Lieberman","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I just want to ask a little bit about the build for profitability. And in particular, you know an area I've been really focused on is operating leverage and as you're showing this really as you put it new and improved top line growth performance. So this quarter much of the upside was driven by in fact positive operating leverage.","And yet productivity despite you calling out the importance of it ongoing in your script was quite, quite low relative to historical quarterly performance. So can you just talk a little bit, I guess, about the outlook for productivity this year? And how we should think about operating leverage? Because it accelerated sequentially even with kind of a comparable revenue performance sequentially. So, just how to kind of work through the math on operating leverage on the stronger top line. Thanks.","Jon Moeller","A stronger top line definitely provides greater operating leverage, as you rightly point out. We had about 50 points of -- 50 basis points of leverage within the gross margin improvement of 190 basis points. And we had an additional 180 basis points of sales leverage between gross and operating. So, 230 basis points overall against a margin improvement on an operating level of 260 basis points.","And I think that's \u2013 generally, if we grow the rule of thumb is if we grow 4%, we should have 50 basis points to 75 basis points of leverage. That increases pretty significantly as we move up the curve beyond 4% and you saw that in the quarter we just completed.","Productivity continues to be a significant focus area. Some of our savings are backloaded as we go through this year. But again, they'll be comping significantly higher earnings numbers in the base periods.","There are still very large opportunities in front of us: efficiencies in media, efficiencies in organization design, significant savings as we bring on fully the product supply transformation and big opportunities top and bottom line from increasing digitization of our efforts all around.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks and congratulations on a strong start to the year. Geez lots of questions still on the table. Let me start with growth. I guess, my one question with you out there in terms of market growth. Jon you mentioned in your script that you expect price contribution to wane as the year progresses and you comped last year's price gains which I think is intuitively understandable for all of us. But you're pegging your full year guidance to a market growth rate of just 3% to 3.5%, which presumably that market growth is going to experience that same phenomenon of waning price growth.","So my question is, is it reasonable to assume that market growth also slows with price moderation? Or are you seeing and do you expect to see a pickup in terms of volume mix contribution both for your firm in aggregate like we saw this quarter and the market overall?","Jon Moeller","Thanks Jason. We do expect to -- we've seen -- the underlying market growth rates there has been a price component as you rightly point out that should annualize itself as you rightly point out. But there's also been an increase in the volume component of market growth. So we are seeing an increase on the margin and market growth in the units. And that should continue as we progress forward.","In terms of our own top line algorithm, price was one point of the seven in the quarter. So if you assume that completely annualizes that's one point impact.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.","Steve Powers","Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Jon I was hoping you could take a step back and talk a little bit more broadly about what you're seeing with regard to consumer demand and competition in three markets if I could: Russia, China and Brazil? Is there anything you're seeing now that concerns you in terms of competitive activity or waning demand in any of those -- in any of your key categories in those markets? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","That was Russia, Brazil, China. Generally, Steve across the board, we are seeing continued consumer strength. And generally across the board, we are seeing the levels of healthy competition that you would generally expect.","If I take the markets in question. China we were up 13% in the quarter. Market growth rates continued to be strong. It's a very competitive environment always has been, likely will be for the foreseeable future just given the opportunity and the size of price. And that's both local competition and multinational competition. But we haven't seen any significant uptick in the levels of competition. It's always on always strong in a market like China.","The consumer in China continues to respond to premium innovation that performs in categories where performance drives brand choice and we see that time and time again on both sides of the ledger.","In terms of the other markets that you mentioned, consumer demand in Brazil continues to be strong and respond to strong innovation. But it's -- I would describe it as more volatile and more fickle than for example China.","Our growth rates in Brazil vary pretty dramatically by quarter but generally continue to be strong. In the quarter we just completed we grew 2% in Brazil. But prior to that we were growing at significantly higher rates; I don't view that 2% as a slowdown in consumer as much as I do just inherent variability and volatility of that business.","And Russia continues to perform as well. We grew the business 5% in the quarter in Russia. From a competitive standpoint, again those markets are very strong as it relates to competition, nothing specific to note.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.","Ali Dibadj","Hi, guys. So I just had a couple of questions if I could. One is just actually the broader question here is on sustainability of such strong results. And I guess you're guiding throughout to a little bit of slowdown lapping tough numbers et cetera. So I was hoping you could give some more color, a little bit about two pieces in particular and you touched on it a moment ago. But just more around pricing, particularly pricing as commodities perhaps are rolling over here and you have less of a cost justified reason to take the pricing up.","And secondly in terms of the volumes you mentioned certainly growth in the category from unit\u2019s perspective, but your unit growth is outsized. And I just wonder how much of that is from what we're actually seeing on shelf, which is more shelf space growth. So how just kind of same-store sales same square foot sales versus growth from a shelf space perspective? That's a sustainability question.","And a sub-question to that is you, obviously, like everybody else have some really good categories more than really good right now, really good businesses and some that aren't doing so well, obviously, Grooming regarding some pieces of Baby Care et cetera. I'm trying to figure out whether you're seeing different retailer reactions or interactions with you given your haves and have not-type categories. I understand you have fewer categories than perhaps most that aren\u2019t firing on all cylinders, but are you seeing that retailers pull different levers when things aren't growing the way they'd like to be? Thanks very much.","Jon Moeller","First, as it relates to sustainability of the results. Comp issues aside and the comp issues are -- or the comp dynamic is obviously real and prevalent and increasingly prevalent as we progress through the fiscal year.","We've really tried to ensure two things are an inherent part of how we think about the business and operate the business and both lend themselves to sustainability of results over the long-term.","The first is balance across the top and bottom line. I think you saw in the quarter that we just reported, it's a very balanced quarter in terms of strong growth on both. And to the extent that we can continue to deliver both, which we're committed to do the overall value creation result becomes much more sustainable.","We've witnessed periods of time in our company and certainly within the industry and adjacent industries where the focus has disproportionately shifted, for example, to the bottom line. That is not a sustainable strategy in our view. And we've seen instances certainly in our own experience where focus has shifted disproportionately to the top line, which also is not a sustainable strategy in our view. So the balancing of the top and bottom line does lead to an expectation of more sustainable value creation delivery.","The second piece is probably even more important and that is how we\u2019re thinking about sources of growth. And we're really trying as part of our superiority strategy to source growth through creation of business in the marketplace by driving market growth. That is a much more sustainable and generally more profitable way to drive our business.","We\u2019re creating business not taking business from others. And when you are the driver of market growth, you will mathematically build share. So those two concepts are not incongruent. They're in complete congruence. And the question is how do you most sustainably and profitably build share? And we're now contributing to market growth at rates above our market share, which is exactly where we want to be, but that's important to the dynamics that I just described. It's also much more meaningful and relevant to our retail partners. They frankly could care less about P&G market share gains. What they care about is the overall market basket and the margins that they earn on that basket. So both of those focuses from a business model standpoint should conceptually increase the sustainability of our results.","We'll have to demonstrate that in the marketplace. But certainly over the last five quarters if you look at the top line 4%, 4%, 5%, 7%, 7% doesn't guarantee anything in the future but it's been sustainable progress at least for a period of time.","Relative to pricing, we -- I want to be careful on commenting on future pricing activities. What I would say is that to date, we feel good about the pricing that we've taken both as it relates to commodities and as it relates to foreign exchange and some of the developing markets. But that's something we look at on a category country basis every morning when we make up, and we'll adjust as we need to.","Relative to the source of volume growth, I mentioned a significant portion of our growth is coming through creation of new business. There is as well and you're right to point out increase in distribution as you would expect given the demonstrated ability to grow markets for our retail partners. But those two things are not separable. And we've talked previously about the retail view of P&G, which has improved significantly, earning top consumer, products manufacturer at Walmart, really across the board and increasing \u2013 you saw the Advantage Monitor, survey where we're number one in our industry across all metrics that are measured and number one by a significant margin. We need to keep improving that. That's not any guarantee for success tomorrow but it is one of the reasons coupled with demonstrated ability to grow markets in many categories that we are increasing the level of distribution. And I don't see that as a step-function curve. I think it has room to continue to grow. Obviously to the extent that we demonstrate the same dynamic across more categories that's another driver of future growth.","Operator","All right. Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Good morning, guys. So sticking to the subject of top line growth and sustainability, I was hoping you'd give us an update on what you saw in fiscal Q1 in terms of a competitive response both on the pricing front as well as in terms of marketing spend from your key competitors given your market share gains. And give us a sense of what you're assuming in guidance in the balance of the year from a competitive environment standpoint, if the environment heats up as you cycle some of these price increases and theoretically competitors look to regain some share momentum.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Dara. You've certainly heard and not surprisingly competition talking about reinvesting in their businesses. I think that's driven by two things. One is the turnover of a generation of leadership in many of our competitive set. And two is the result situation that, we've been talking about together here this morning. We have not seen anything destructive in a mass aggregate scale in the market place from a competitive standpoint. We operate in very competitive industries so that doesn't change. But there hasn't been a step-function increase for example in the level of volume that's being sold on promotion. There has been increased initiative activity innovation driven. That's generally constructive for market growth.","So we support that and we'll see. I do expect generally competition to increase as we continue going through the fiscal year. And remember, the time that exist between when you state an intent and when you can actually execute in the market is not short. It's relatively long, just given shelf set dynamics at retail, execution dynamics associated with for example innovation. So I wouldn't say that, we've seen everything that we're going to see.","We're in a better position to deal with that than we've been in a long time given increasing percentage of our sales that are superior from a product package communication go-to-market standpoint. We still have work to do, which is why we're going to continue to invest and fund that through productivity. And that's our best defense.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","Yeah. Thanks and good morning, everybody. I just wanted to dig a bit deeper in some category specifics there. So, curious your thoughts about, what you're seeing in kind of real time in paper goods and competitive dynamics in laundry. It seems like you've had kind of the strongest volume growth on very strong comparisons there. Pricing maybe dipped a little bit sequentially underlying. I'm just curious, if that's a competitive response if that's proactive. Is there something in the market that's kind of changed? Just sort of there any color there will be helpful on those categories. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Laundry had a very strong quarter, up 8% driven by momentum really across the globe. We continue to advance the premium segment both laundry and fabric enhancers. Global value share was up about 0.5 point. Our growth on those premium segments, which include single-unit dose and scent beads, was high-teens and that's \u2013 that's really e-commerce sales up almost 50%. So, really what we're seeing there is innovation-driven, superiority-driven, market-growth-accretive growth, which to the point of the earlier question I expect would be sustainable at some level. And that's what I think about when I think about the laundry and fabric enhancer's category not a specific competitive dynamic.","We continue to grow the paper businesses at very high levels in aggregate. And that segment, because of its \u2013 those segments because of their capital intensity are a little bit more responsive from a competitive dynamic standpoint to a variety of factors. But again, I would characterize the landscape as innovation-driven superiority-driven market-accretive growth.","Think about \u2013 let's take one of those businesses Feminine Care as an example. Feminine Care in a quarter we grew 7% and that's composed of both strong growth on our base feminine protection business and high-teens level growth on our adult incontinence business. And we had an objective as we entered that category to source our growth through increased market growth. And we essentially doubled the rate of market growth for the adult incontinence category across the geographies where we've entered. So, again that is the predominance or the character of the landscape and the growth drivers as I see it.","Operator","And next we'll go to Wendy Nicholson with Citi.","Wendy Nicholson","Hi. Good morning. My question has to do with the U.S. market the U.S. consumer and it's less about pricing than it is maybe the mix of your businesses and brands. If the U.S. consumer is going to slow number one, do you think you see that coming early enough to react and to make sure that the fact that so many of your brands are relatively premium priced in your categories don't cede share? So, I guess the question is on brands, like Luvs or Gain, are you thinking about doing more innovation there more, promotion there, more feature displays? Or is it a pack size issue? In other words, if the economy slows how do you make sure that people don't feel pinched and trade down from some of your more premium-priced brands? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","In terms of predicting any kind of consumer acceleration or consumer slowdown, we really \u2013 we aren't in that business. There are many things that can affect consumer confidence that are things we wouldn't even have the ability to anticipate today, certain geopolitical events, certain political developments within a country, et cetera.","So your guess is as good as ours in terms of what market growth does going forward. We have seen no signs of weakness. We have seen continued sequential improvement on the margin. But that can change pretty quickly as we've all witnessed during our lifetimes.","We are better positioned today for several reasons to deal with a downturn than we were for example in 2007, 2008. Number one, we are largely out of highly discretionary categories. This was part and parcel of our thinking as we moved to daily-use categories, categories that consumers are much less likely to go without on a daily basis.","Generally, we don't see consumers stopping laundry or shampooing or conditioning or feminine protection during a recession. To your point, they may trade down and I'll come to that in a second. But from a category standpoint and a portfolio composition standpoint, we are much better positioned than we were previously. That's number one.","Number two, as we've been talking about throughout this call, we are much better positioned from a brand advantage standpoint. The products performing at noticeable levels of superiority in terms of meeting very important consumer needs and desires. And that is a major contributor to the overall value equation that consumers use as they assess their brand choice.","There are two portfolio matters: So we've moved not only into daily-use categories but into categories where performance drives brand choice. And we're continuing to invest to build that advantage which is no guarantee but does increase the resilience of the portfolio to headwinds from a consumer standpoint.","Third, we've worked to improve the pricing ladders, the availability of product at different price points, different pack sizes. That also is not a guarantee. But you put all of that together, again no guarantees but we're in a much better place. We will use tools like value messaging, like pack sizes, like performance messaging to ensure that if there is a downturn, we're as best positioned for consumers who are in a pinch.","Operator","And next we'll go to Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. So I have a question on supply chain in click and collect and the rise of online with that \u2013 how that impacts your business. Specifically, wanted to understand, as you see in stores require more and more inventory for stuff going out the side of the door, how do we think about that impacting your categories? Are you reducing your SKU count at all? How does that impact the weeks of supply in stock throughout the supply chain?","Because we've noticed over, let's call it the last two years, most CPG companies have been reporting the national retailers are bringing down these weeks of supply. Would you say they were kind of like near a bottom, especially in a portfolio like Proctor, where you're seeing the sales productivity lift much higher? Should we expect a \u2013 you talk rate a little bit differently than the peer set? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","We want to be SKU efficient and have the right assortment at the shelf both in terms of serving the consumer and in terms of the right turnover for our retail partners. Nothing has really changed in that context. Relative to the trade inventory situation, I think we mentioned on the last call, a slight increase in inventories across the retail channel not consistently but in aggregate to support the things that you are describing as well as a commitment from a delivery standpoint to have product available for consumers on shorter and shorter notice, which requires higher inventories.","In the quarter that we just \u2013 that \u2013 we saw that dynamic in the fourth quarter of last year. Those inventory levels have generally remained but we haven't seen any significant change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.","Olivia Tong","Great. Thanks. Just want to follow up on your comp \u2013 you were discussing about driving growth or creating businesses new categories. And you've obviously shown your ability across your portfolio with that. So can you talk a little bit about what's changed in terms of R&D, your market research processes, your marketing processes, the change in your reporting structure that's driven that change? Are there more people external partnerships? How does the reporting structure potentially change? How does that restructure change help aid that? If you could just dive into that a little bit more that would be great. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","That's a big question, Olivia. I'll do my best. First, every category needs to be working to create additional sources of market growth within their \u2013 within the definitions of their existing category and in adjacencies relative to their existing category and that's going to be the predominant source of our growth.","And whether that's a fabric enhancer, bead execution, whether that's a laundry single-unit dose execution both of which have significantly inflected market growth rates just as two examples. Some of the initiatives in our Beauty business are doing the same efforts in Power Oral Care as a way to grow markets really across the world.","So that is a continuation of what we've been trying to do. And then we've added to that what we call PG Ventures, which is a innovation effort outside of existing categories and we brought products to market like Zevo, which is a natural insecticide.","We're working across five or six pretty exciting opportunities that have come out of PG Ventures. That reports to Mary Lynn Ferguson. So it doesn't report into each and every category like she coordinates those efforts for us along with our outside venture partners.","From a overall standpoint, whether it's internal innovation to drive superiority to drive market growth or innovation in P&G Ventures, we're operating much more through the lens of lean innovation which simplistically we could spend a day on that. But simplistically is designed to deliver faster, better learning, more shots on goal to increase the chance of breaking through and really having something meaningful to bring to market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Grundy with Jefferies.","Kevin Grundy","Thanks, good morning, and congratulations on the strong result. Jon, I want to come back to the U.S. and maybe drill down a little bit on some of the channel dynamics. So obviously another really strong result: organic sales growth up 6% in the U.S. but probably like 3x roughly the market growth rate, which I would estimate is probably closer to 2. And looking at the scanner data that's probably about 300 basis points higher, so it looks like that gap is widening and understanding obviously online is growing quite rapidly. I think it was up mid-20s. I missed it this quarter. I apologize for that. Maybe you could provide us that number. But the questions would be number one any timing benefit that will potentially reverse out in the upcoming quarter? And then maybe spend a little bit of time on discussing some of the channel dynamics between tracked versus non-tracked that would be helpful. Thank you.","Jon Moeller","Thanks, Kevin. The tracked number as you know was effectively 3% in the U.S. for the quarter. And as you cited, the overall number was about 6%. That delta is almost entirely due to faster growth rates in non-tracked channels. I mentioned global growth from a e-commerce standpoint at 30%. So customers like Amazon are growing at higher rates than some others. But also for example the club channel is growing at rates that are above the rate of market growth. There are not significant one-timers within the quarter in the U.S. The one significant one-timer that is in our aggregate results is the sell in ahead of the VAT increase, which went into effect on October 1 in Japan. That had about a 30 or 40 basis point impact on our numbers.","Operator","And next we'll go to Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.","Andrea Teixeira","Hi, good morning. Just echoing the congrats. So I was hoping Jon if you can comment a bit more on China where you grew 13%, you accelerated from 12% in the last quarter. But you faced tough comps ahead. So do you think it's -- growth is still driven by SK-II and Olay or is it more broad-based now into hair and other categories? So are you worried about your comps is getting tougher starting in this quarter or -- and related to that you comment on price in baby is still being deflationary. So when do you think you can cycle that process and offset with more premium diapers growth? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","We're always concerned about comps getting tougher, always working to run harder. That's a part of the world that we live in. Generally, it is not just for example SK-II and Olay which are growing at fantastic rates in China, but our growth profile across the categories has broadened significantly. You mentioned Baby Care. We were up high single-digits in Baby Care in the quarter very strong response to the innovation that we've brought to market. We are growing generally across the board. The one exception which has improved significantly is Hair Care. In Hair Care, we had very modest growth, but that's an improvement versus where we've been the last couple of quarters. So everything's on the rise in China. I feel -- we feel good about our prospects there. For perspective, if you look at China ex Olay and SK-II, we grew 9% in the quarter. So there is much more to the story than just those two businesses though we're very happy with the story on those two businesses.","Operator","All right. Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.","Grant O'Brien","Hi. This is actually Grant on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Just had a quick one on Latin America and in particular Mexico. We've heard from some other companies that the consumer has slowed maybe a little bit there. I was wondering if you were seeing the same thing or any other changes in that market in particular? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","We have been seeing something similar. But frankly consumption in the month of September was very strong and we ended up with top line growth rates at very attractive level in Mexico for the last quarter at 10%.","Operator","All right. Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you, good morning. Jon I wanted to circle back on your Beauty business and just really understand how sustainable the strong growth that you're seeing out of that business. How confident you are that this can continue especially as the comps get tougher? Maybe you could help us understand what it will be driven by. Is it better and stronger innovation? If so can you give us some examples maybe of what's been working. And then give us a sense of the levels of innovation in your pipeline this year versus last year. And then finally maybe help us understand why some of your innovation seem to be better resonating with the consumer ultimately driving what I assume to be share gains? Thanks.","Jon Moeller","One thing that gives us confidence about continued success in Beauty are the sustainability of the results we've been delivering is the breadth of those results. And I think as I reflect on several of the conversations that we've had together there's a bit of a misunderstanding that it's all driven by SK-II and that just isn't the case. So we grew hair, our Hair Care business mid single-digits in the last quarter. We grew that business at 6% in the U.S. All aspects of our Skin and Personal Care business are growing. Our Personal Care business which is deodorants and body washes and those kinds of products grew at 10% in the quarter. Obviously, Skin Care and SK-II grew at even higher rates than that. If I looked just at SK-II it's one -- it's the fastest-growing part of the portfolio. Our new user attraction continues to be our focus. And as long as we keep that door open, we should continue to grow and that's been happening. But again breadth of success across Beauty.","Operator","All right. Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","Yeah. Thanks, good morning everyone. Jon I was hoping you can talk about the big dialogue that's been over the last few years, big brands versus small brands. And I was wondering if you could just kind of give us your perspective on this whole next-day same-day delivery battle between Amazon and Walmart and other retailers kind of getting into the fray now. And how that impacts big brands versus small brands in the sense of supply chain integrity and things like that? So maybe you could just give us some thoughts around that dynamic?","Jon Moeller","I'm not sure I know Nik exactly what the impact is going to be on those two subsets of businesses, small brands versus large brands directly as a result of what you just described.","What I have felt for a long time, what we have felt for a long time and have been talking about for a long time is the relevance -- the continued relevance of large brands, as well as the relevance of small brands in certain instances across our ecosystem.","Our large brands historically have grown about 4 points faster than our small brands. And when you look at the absolute growth that comes from that, it's significantly higher. But large -- every large brand started off as a small brand and so we can't ignore that dynamic either.","As you know, we've been buying and building some smaller brands to serve some rapidly growing consumer segments particularly in the natural space, but not confined to that. I generally think -- we generally think that the ecosystem as we move forward at minimum does not disadvantage big brands. And I can make pretty strong arguments for why it should advantage big brands.","When you think about e-commerce as the fastest growing channel in many -- well certainly in our two largest markets in the U.S. and China and the dynamic of big brands versus small brands in that environment. It disproportionately favors big brands, not at the exclusion of small brands by any means, but certainly doesn't disadvantage big brands.","And I'd be happy to talk for hours about that, but I will spare the group that diatribe right here. But generally, we feel that both large brands and small brands will have relevance moving forward. There is nothing structurally or a from a society standpoint that disadvantages big brands particularly and this important when you focus your portfolio on categories where performance drives brand choice.","There are very few consumers that sit in front of a physical or virtual shelf and how ask how large a brand is? They're wondering, how well it will to do the job they're buying it to do and will it meet their needs and solve their problems?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with Macquarie.","Caroline Levy","Good morning and thank you very much. Jon I wonder, if you could dive in a little deeper into Grooming and talk about what you found is working, which regions it's working in? And how you think about the future? I mean it's -- is there any opportunity to return to growth in this business for you and what's the plan?","Jon Moeller","Definitely, opportunities to return to growth, in fact, we've been growing albeit modestly. Each of the last two quarters we grew on a global basis. If you think about -- I mean, there are number of reasons to be positive going forward. One is, the growth potential that exists in developing markets and the mix potential that exists in those markets as people move up potentially from a double edge or disposables use into systems use.","Strong opportunity to further penetrate, though, the double-edge and disposable businesses, particularly in some of the developing markets where for example a lot of the shaves are executed in the context of a barber.","So significant opportunities for growth, we're also seeing a very strong response to our newest innovation which is designed to address one of the major barriers to shave and that's skin irritation. And for many men this is a significant issue. This isn't a minor issue. And it literally prevents them from shaving more frequently.","So SkinGuard is designed to address that need and increase as a result the frequency of shave and the number of people who do shave. And we've doubled the rate of razor growth with that entry in Europe.","If you look at consumer ratings on that product in the U.S., they're very strong. I think they're 4.5, 4.6. And the retailer reaction in terms of space allocation has been very favorable.","There are also significant opportunities to address the needs of men who choose not to shave and that's where we're also spending a lot of incremental effort to make sure that we're meeting his needs. And if we do that in a superior way, for both shavers and non-shavers, this category will grow and it's extraordinarily profitable.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Ottenstein with Evercore ISI.","Robert Ottenstein","Great. Thank you very much. Jon, earlier on I think you mentioned that in aggregate you had seen some pickup in demand, I think, maybe from roughly 3% to 3% to 3.5%. Could you perhaps be -- give us a little bit more detail in terms of which countries you see somewhat better demand than over, let's say, the last 12 months and which categories? Thank you.","Jon Moeller","The U.S. is front and center and that's generally across categories, with Grooming being an exception.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair.","Jon Andersen","Hey, thanks. Just a quick one. Personal Healthcare was up double digits in the quarter. You did mention that there was some benefit from presets by retailers about the cough-cold season. How much of a benefit was that? I mean, was that just kind of a comp issue relative to last year? Are they planning for a stronger season this year? And then if you could talk briefly about the integration of the Merck business.","Jon Moeller","Acquisition of -- or integration of the Merck business is going very well and a quick thank you to all those who are involved in that effort. We continue to grow that business at very attractive rates and continue to grow our heritage P&G Personal Healthcare business at very attractive rates.","As you said, the total grew double digits in the quarter. If anything, if my knowledge is correct, it may not be, but if anything we saw, a slower buy in ahead of the season of this year as compared to, for example, last year, but certainly not a significant impact either way.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Edward Lewis with Atlantic Equities. ","Edward Lewis","Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to drill down into Europe, because I guess you're close to start where you suggests all geographic regions are growing at 4% or more. I guess, Europe's included with that. And, I guess, things really haven't been that great of late.","So I was just wondering, it's a tougher operating environment. You've got lots of regions to survey or to execute against. And you've rolled out the -- your focus on superiority and end-to-end SBU strategy a bit later. But it does seems as though the market share trends and the underlying growth rate seems to be improving over here as well.","Jon Moeller","Europe is definitely included in the characterization of all regions growing at 4% or more. Our big focus markets in Europe grew at 4% during the quarter. The more developing parts of Europe grew at 5% during the quarter. Really broad growth across countries within Europe: Germany, for example, up 6%; Russia up 5%; the combination of France and the U.K. up 2% to 3%.","So we're seeing certainly growth ahead of the market in Europe. We built share -- our share position very nicely over the past 12, six, three and one-month period. So we're very happy with our performance there.","Jon Moeller","I want to thank everybody. I know this is a busy morning with a number of companies reporting, so thank you for your time. John, Katie and I are available the balance of the day to answer any questions that you have to the best of our ability. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."]}}
